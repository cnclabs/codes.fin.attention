table of contents these product lines are reported as business components under the regional segments as follows specialty construction north america insulating glass north america packaging solutions north america paints latin america consumer asia pacific total company when reviewing the company s financial statements  it is important to understand how certain external factors impact the company 
these factors include changes in the prices of commodities  such as crude oil and natural gas global supply and demand of raw materials economic growth rates  especially in the united states and europe  and currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar the company purchases thousands of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum natural gas derivatives 
with over percent of its cost of sales accounted for by raw materials  the company s financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
in addition to the impact from commodity prices  the supply and demand of raw materials also have a significant impact on the company s costs 
as demand increases in high growth areas  such as the asia pacific region  the supply of key raw materials may tighten  resulting in certain materials being put on allocation 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  also can have an impact as key raw material producers are shut down for extended periods of time 
management continually monitors areas such as capacity utilization figures  market supply and demand conditions  feedstock costs and inventory levels  as well as derivative and intermediate prices  which affect the company s raw materials 
in the company generated percent of its revenue in the us and percent in europe 
the pace of economic growth in these areas directly impacts certain industries to which the company supplies products 
for example  adhesives related revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances  furniture and other woodworking applications tend to fluctuate with the economic activity 
in business components such as specialty construction and insulating glass  revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar  the company s revenues and costs become higher as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars 
the fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar has the most significant impact as compared to all other currencies 
in  the currency fluctuations had a significant impact on the company s financial results as the us dollar weakened against all major currencies 
net revenue increased nearly million  or percent  in due to the weakness of the us dollar 
the estimated impact on earnings per share was an increase of as compared to key financial results and transactions for included the following net revenue declined percent from as sales volume declines were mitigated by the positive effects of foreign currency exchange rates and increases in average selling prices 
raw material cost inflation during was estimated at nearly percent as measured by raw material prices as of november  as compared to prices as of december  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent of net revenue were percent as compared to percent in

see additional discussion in management discussion and analysis and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
completed million share repurchase program that was authorized in january completed acquisition of the principle assets of egymelt limited partnership company egymelt located in th of october city  egypt on august  for approximately million 
the overriding factors impacting the financial results were the global economic slowdown and the raw material cost inflation 
the economic slowdown that began primarily in the us construction and housing markets in  expanded to most major markets and industries in the credit crisis in late exasperated the situation 
the economic slowdown was the primary contributor to sales volume decreases in of percent as compared to selling price increases were aggressively implemented in the second half of the year to mitigate the increases in raw material costs however the gross profit margin still declined percentage points as compared to lower sg a expenses partially offset the reduced gross profit 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  before accounting change  was as compared to in the negative impact from the goodwill and other impairment charges on the diluted earnings per share result was per share 
in spite of the depressed financial results in  the company continued to invest for the future 
new investments were made in the asia pacific region to strengthen the organization and open a new technology center 
a new manufacturing facility was approved in and is expected to be completed in the asia pacific region continues to be a key growth area for the company 
the executive committee of the company was strengthened by the hiring of a new chief financial officer  a new chief technology officer and a new senior vice president in charge of the north america operating segment 
each of them brings excellent credentials to hb fuller 
outlook the economy continues to be the top concern heading into the severe slowdown seen in the last two months of is expected to impact the company s financial results at least through the first quarter of  and most likely through the entire fiscal year 
with oil prices down substantially from their highs in mid and overall global demand in decline  raw material prices did begin to fall in the fourth quarter of the raw material prices however remain well above their year end levels 
foreign currency exchange rates are expected to have a negative effect on the financial results 
the euro  which was trading above for much of  had decreased in value to at november  a similar pattern was shown for other major foreign currencies 
the stronger dollar means foreign currency denominated revenues and costs translate into fewer us dollars 
the current economic environment makes it very difficult to make accurate projections of future financial results 
therefore  no specific quantitative guidance for is included in this report 
management is committed to executing on its long range strategy while managing through the economic uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill impairment assessment  long lived assets recoverability  conditional asset retirement obligation assumptions  share based compensation accounting  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 

table of contents pension and other postretirement plan assumptions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us the company sponsors other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on management s assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and health care cost trend rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is august note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate for the us pension plan was percent at august  as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  a discount rate reduction of percentage points increases pension and other postretirement plan expense approximately million pretax 
discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the current investment mix in the us portfolios is primarily in us equities 
the rate used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for was percent 
for and  the company used a rate of percent due to the reallocation of the portfolio assets to include a component of fixed income securities 
a change of percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption would impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense pretax by approximately million 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans is determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  management has used the rate of percent for  percent for and percent for goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all the activities within a reporting unit are available to support the value of goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units 
management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates  future capital expenditures  etc 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and 
table of contents identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
the company s annual goodwill impairment assessment has been historically completed during the fourth quarter based on balance sheet information as of the end of the fiscal third quarter 
based on its annual assessment  the company initially determined that none of its goodwill was impaired 
in the fourth quarter of however  as economic conditions worsened and the capital markets became distressed  management determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment assessment as of november  that assessment resulted in the determination that the fair value of the company s specialty construction reporting unit was less than the carrying value of its net assets  including goodwill 
this was due to a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected from the reporting unit 
the adverse economic conditions  especially in the us housing and other construction markets  were the primary driver of the reduction in forecasted discounted cash flows 
the amount of the pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was million million after tax 
the million pretax charge was an estimated amount as of november  the final valuation work will be completed in the first quarter of and additional amounts may be recorded in that period 
the total amount of goodwill assigned to the specialty construction reporting unit  prior to any impairment charges  was million 
therefore  the total pretax impairment charge related to the specialty construction reporting unit cannot exceed million 
recoverability of long lived assets the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects management s assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  currency exchange  and tax rates and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
conditional asset retirement obligations in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 conditional asset retirement obligations fin  the company has recognized conditional asset retirement obligations related to special handling of asbestos related materials in certain facilities 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company has identified certain facilities for which it has plans or expectations of plans to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos or has plans or expectation of plans to exit a facility 
in addition  the company has determined that all facilities have some level of asbestos that will require abatement action in the future 
once the probability and timeframe of an action are determined  the company applies certain assumptions to determine the related liability and asset 
these assumptions include the 
table of contents use of inflation rates  the use of credit adjusted risk free discount rates and the reliance on third party asbestos abatement specialists to estimate the costs to handle asbestos related materials 
the recorded liability is required to be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and or revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate 
share based compensation the company has granted stock options  restricted stock and deferred compensation awards to certain employees and non employee directors 
the company recognizes compensation expense for all share based payments granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  the company recognizes share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognizes compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 
prior to sfas r adoption  the company accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and accordingly  only recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards  which had a grant date intrinsic value 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the company uses the black scholes model to value its stock option awards 
management believes that future volatility will not materially differ from its historical volatility 
thus  the company uses the historical volatility of the company s common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and management uses different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
as of november   the company has recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at its sorocaba  brazil facility 
in the eifs litigation involving primarily single family homes  million for the potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries were accrued 
the company also has accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation as of november  a complete discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments and or periodic settlements could negatively impact the company s results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 

table of contents income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at november   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million note

the net revenue was million or percent above the net revenue of  million in management reviews variances in net revenue in terms of changes related to product pricing  sales volume  acquisitions divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table shows the net revenue variance analysis for the past two years decrease vs vs product pricing sales volume acquisitions divestitures currency total sales volume declines in vs 
were driven by the economic slowdowns  especially in north america and europe 
quarterly sales volume decreases as compared to were improving through the first nine months of the year 
during the fourth quarter  however  in conjunction with the disruption in the global financial and credit markets  the fourth quarter negative impact on net revenue due to sales volume declines was percent 
revenues generated from increases in selling prices in response to rising raw material costs partially offset the effects of the volume declines 
the positive impact from currency resulted primarily from the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
that positive impact through the first nine months of was percent  however in the fourth quarter the dollar strengthened against the euro and other major currencies 
net revenue decreases in as compared to resulting from lower sales volumes were most prevalent in north america as declines in the us housing and construction markets began in the net revenue increases due to acquisitions divestitures was primarily the result of a full year of the roanoke acquisition in north america and the insulating glass acquisition in europe that were both completed in cost of sales in millions vs vs cost of sales percent of net revenue the cost of sales increased percent in despite the sales volume decrease of percent 
this was a direct result of double digit growth in raw material costs 
the inflation rate on raw materials as measured from year end to year end was estimated at nearly percent 
the impact on raw material expense included in cost of sales was estimated at a percent increase 
the difference in rates reflects the ramping up 
table of contents of raw material prices throughout the year 
a key factor in the raw material cost increase was the price of crude oil  which reached record levels during the year of nearly per barrel 
the raw material price increases were tempered late in the year as the economy continued to slow down and the price of oil decreased 
the cost of sales in was relatively flat with decreases in cost of sales due to the percent reduction in sales volume were offset by increases due to the impact of stronger foreign currencies and also having the roanoke and european insulating glass acquisitions for a full year in as compared to a partial year in gross profit margin in millions vs vs gross profit percent of net revenue selling price increases in did not keep pace with the increases in raw material costs resulting in a percentage point decline in the gross profit margin as compared to the speed and magnitude of the raw material price increases created a difficult environment for raising selling prices in the increased margin in as compared to resulted from the continuation of the company s strategy that began in of repositioning its product lines to more value added applications 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in millions vs vs sg a percent of net revenue the sg a expenses in decreased from in terms of both dollars and as a percent of net revenue 
reduced headcount  lower pension expenses  reduced management incentive compensation and stringent cost controls all contributed to the reduced sg a expenses

the sg a expenses in were lower than in spite of increases due to the effects of foreign currencies as well as having the acquisitions in place for the full year 
the expenses included charges of million related to the separation agreement with the former ceo

the goodwill charge related primarily to the goodwill acquired in the roanoke acquisition 
reduced discounted cash flow projections due to the adverse economic conditions  especially in the us housing and other construction markets  was the primary reason for the present value of future cash flows to fall below the net asset carrying value of the specialty

total north america the percent net revenue decrease in as compared to was driven by decreases exceeding percent in both the specialty construction and insulating glass components 
the revenue in these components has a direct correlation with the construction industry in the us especially with us housing starts 
with housing starts at record low levels in  it was not unusual for the revenues of these components to show significant declines 
the disruption in the financial markets in the fourth quarter of had a negative impact on all components of the north america segment 
raw material costs increased nearly percent in the north america segment 
all four business components were impacted by these increases 
the decreased gross profit margin was the primary reason for the percent decrease in operating income 
the operating income margin decreased to percent in from percent in the net revenue decrease in of percent from was largely due to sales volume losses in the construction related markets in the us the insulating glass and specialty construction components were especially hard hit by the construction slowdown 
selling price increases contributed a positive percent to the net revenue variance to in spite of the difficult economic environment  operating income in north america increased percent in as compared to improvements in product mix and disciplined cost controls were the main reasons for the improved profitability 
the operating income margin improved from percent in to percent in 
table of contents adhesives sales volume decreases of percent were partially mitigated by the percent increase in average selling prices 
pricing activity was more aggressive in the second half of the year as raw material prices continued to escalate 
the sales volume declines were driven by the slowdown in the us economy as the slowdown in went beyond just the construction related industries 
the raw material cost inflation exceeded the impacts from selling price increases resulting in a decreased gross profit margin from sg a expense decreases in were not enough to offset the negative effects of the raw material increases 
operating income declined percent compared to and the operating income margin was percent as compared to percent in sales volumes were down percent in as compared to the slowdown in us housing and other construction end markets had a significant impact on the reduced volume 
selling prices increased percent for the year  primarily due to price increases implemented in the second half of the carolina polymers acquisition in the fourth quarter of contributed percent to the net revenue growth as compared to raw material prices were relatively stable for most of the year  with some upward movement in the fourth quarter 
productivity improvements along with favorable product mix contributed to an improved gross margin 
the operating income margin of percent was percentage points above the percent recorded in packaging solutions the economic slowdown hit the packaging solutions component especially hard late in the year resulting in net revenue for falling short of by percent 
the fourth quarter of the year saw net revenue down over percent from the prior year 
increases in raw material prices combined with the reduced sales volume resulted in a decreased gross margin 
the resulting effect on operating income was an percent decrease from the packaging solutions component was the only north american component to record volume growth in the volume was up primarily due to increased market share at large  existing customers as well as from new customer applications 
the higher volume contributed to a higher gross margin that  combined with reduced sg a expenses  resulted in an operating income improvement of percent in versus the sg a expenses included a million credit related to a favorable legal settlement 
specialty construction the specialty construction component continued to be heavily impacted by the slowdown in the us housing and other construction markets in major customers in this component are wholesale ceramic tile and flooring distributors selling directly to contractors and also large retail outlets 
these customers were directly impacted by the slowdown in the us housing industry 
significant new customers were added in however the combination of the slow economy and high raw material costs resulted in a gross profit margin decrease of approximately six percentage points 
also negatively impacting the gross profit margin was the customer sales mix 
significant sales volume decreases in related to lost business that carried high gross profit margins  this business also carried high sg a expenses 
new business added during the year carried lower gross profit margins as well as lower sg a expenses 
sg a expenses also decreased due to reduced headcount and overall stringent cost controls 
the result was an operating income decrease of million or percent as compared to sales volume in decreased percent from primarily due to discontinued product lines and lost market share associated with the roanoke acquisition in as well as the economic slowdown 
a more profitable product mix and reduced legal and settlement costs related to eifs litigation resulted in a percent improvement in operating income as compared to legal and settlement costs decreased more than million in as compared to one significant item in the results was a million charge to sg a expenses related to an eifs product liability settlement 
the first quarter of sg a expenses included million of accelerated amortization expense on a particular trade name that was discontinued 
insulating glass net revenue in the insulating glass component decreased percent in as compared to major customers in this component are manufacturers of windows used in new residential construction 
the fall in us housing starts is having a rippling effect in this industry as the number of window manufacturers 
table of contents is contracting through bankruptcies and industry consolidation 
similar to the other business components in the north america operating segment  selling price increases were not enough to offset the negative effects of low sales volume and escalating raw material costs resulting in a reduction in the gross profit margin of more than five percentage points 
sg a expenses decreased in due to strong cost controls as well as the transfer of certain costs to the corporate cost centers that were then re allocated to other business components 
in addition to the reduced housing starts in the us  another factor in the net revenue decrease from was that as part of the organization realignment  approximately million of net revenue was transferred from the north american insulating glass component to the europe operating segment 
these are products sold to end users in europe 
the gross profit margin improved in due to a more favorable product mix and sg a expenses were down due to key positions that were vacated and not replaced 
the insulating glass component was a good example of where benefits were achieved from the new regional realignment 
key functions that were previously performed at the specific component level were transferred to the regional level 
operating income was below due to the reduced sales volume  however the operating income margin improved to percent from percent in europe in the first quarter of the insulating glass business component was merged with the adhesives component 
the europe operating segment is now managed as one component 
the results for the europe operating segment also include the results of the egymelt acquisition  which was effective august  the following table shows the net revenue and operating income of the europe operating segment

the fourth quarter net revenue actually had a negative impact from currency as compared to the fourth quarter of sales volume decreased percent primarily a result of the economic slowdown 
industrial production was down in both germany and the uk in and the economies of the iberian peninsula were especially hard hit during substantial raw material increases were incurred throughout the europe operating segment in the resulting decrease in the gross profit margin drove the operating income down percent as compared to the egymelt acquisition added million of net revenue to the europe results and a million operating loss 
the operating loss included certain one time costs associated with the acquisition such as the step up of the value in acquired finished goods inventory in accordance with purchase accounting requirements 

table of contents the net revenue variances were generated primarily by the acquisition of the insulating glass business and the impact of the exchange rate of the euro versus the us dollar 
there were also currency effects from the pound sterling and swiss franc  however the impact from these currencies was minimal compared to that of the euro 
operating income for the total region improved by nearly percent in as compared to the stronger euro accounted for an estimated million of the total operating income increase of million

the costs of these allocated resources are not tracked on a where used basis as financial performance is managed to maximize the total operating segment performance 
therefore the above financial information should only be used for directional indications of performance total latin america the latin america segment s revenue growth in was driven by the percent growth in the paints component 
adhesives net revenue fell percent below sales volume increased percent in the paints component and decreased percent in adhesives 
gross margin pressure caused by raw material cost inflation drove the segment operating income down percent in as compared to raw material costs increases throughout the year were approximately percent on average 
the raw material inflation rate  however from year end to year end approximated percent 
both paints and adhesives recorded operating income decreases nearing percent 
total region net revenue in was down percent compared to prices increased percent while sales volume decreased percent 
both adhesives and paints experienced volume declines 
in adhesives the volume decline was largely due to lower volume at key accounts 
in paints  the volume declines were related to the strategy of focusing on the higher quality  higher margin paints 
operating income for the year decreased percent from as operating income in paints increased percent while adhesives declined percent 

table of contents adhesives the sales volume decreases in resulted primarily from the slower economic activity 
customers were cutting back on their inventory levels  particularly in the latter part of the year 
average selling price increases of percent helped mitigate the sales volume shortfall however the gross margin declined over percentage points due to the raw material increases 
the operating income as a percent of net revenue fell to percent in as compared to percent in selling prices contributed a positive percent to the net revenue in as compared to  however sales volume decreased percent 
gross margin declined in partially due to the sales volume decreases 
also contributing to the margin decline were million of charges related to the soil remediation project at the company s facility in brazil  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
another factor in the reduced margin in as compared to was that included a million credit in cost of sales related to an insurance recovery of a previous claim 
the operating margin declined to percent in as compared to percent in paints selling prices increased percent during but that was significantly less than the raw material cost increases 
investments in retail stores during had a positive impact on the net revenue growth 
the net revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter of in large part due to the effects of severe weather in honduras  panama and costa rica 
a decline in the gross profit margin combined with higher sg a expenses associated with the retail store investments drove the operating income down percent as compared to net revenue was down percent in as compared to but the operating income increased percent 
the primary reason for the increase in operating income was the improved gross margin resulting from a focus on the higher end paint market

therefore the above financial information should only be used for directional indications of performance 
total asia pacific sales volume growth in adhesives was the key driver of the overall net revenue growth in the asia pacific segment 
positive currency effects contributed percent to the net revenue growth in  however similar to the euro  the effects were negative in the fourth quarter 
the currency effects in the asia pacific segment are driven largely by the australian dollar versus the us dollar 
asia pacific incurred similar gross profit margin pressures as the other operating segments due to raw material cost increases 
the raw material cost increases  which were minimal through the first half of the year  escalated to upwards of percent by the end of on a year over year basis 
operating income increased million or percent as compared to net revenue was relatively flat in as compared to  except for the impact of currency exchange rates 
currency fluctuations accounted for a percent increase 
investments in the sg a expense area were made in key management positions to better position the company for the long term in asia pacific 
as a result  the operating income margin declined percentage points to percent 
adhesives sales volume growth in adhesives was driven by growth in the greater china markets 
this is a key market for the company in which management continues to invest 
a new technical center opened in shanghai in and a manufacturing plant  also in shanghai  is scheduled to open in early because of raw material cost inflation and additional investments in growth initiatives the operating income in adhesives declined percent in as compared to currency effects of percent were the main factor in the net revenue increase over volume decreases of percent were partially offset by price increases of percent 
investments in additional management positions in increased sg a expenses and resulted in a decrease in adhesives operating income of percent in from consumer sales volume declines of percent were partially offset by selling price increases of percent in the consumer component revenue is generated primarily in australia 
the australian dollar saw large fluctuations in as compared to the us dollar resulting in a percent positive impact on net revenue 
through the first nine months of the positive currency effect on net revenue was percent however the fourth quarter currency effect compared to was a negative percent 
the sales volume declines in were driven by the slowdown in the australian housing and construction markets 
the operating income improved percent  largely due to the positive foreign currency effects 
the consumer component experienced an percent net revenue increase in as compared to  with percent resulting from stronger currencies 
the currency effects combined with a favorable product mix and significant sg a expense savings led to an increase in operating income from million in to million in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total cash and cash equivalents as of november  were million as compared to million as of december  the lower cash at year end was a direct result of the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the cash balance at year end was elevated by million of net proceeds received in november as a result of the divestiture of the automotive business component 

table of contents total long and short term debt was million as of november  and million as of december  the increase in debt resulted from additional borrowings of million on the line of credit used to finance the share repurchase program  offset by a million repayment of the line of credit and the annual million payment on the private placement debt 
the company s capitalization ratio as measured by total debt divided by total debt plus stockholders equity was percent at november  as compared to percent at december  the reduction in stockholders equity due to the stock repurchases was a key factor in the increased capitalization ratio 
on june  the company will pay the current installment of million on the company s senior long term debt

the company relies largely on operating cash flow  short term borrowings and long term debt to provide for the working capital needs of the operations 
management believes that the company has the ability to obtain both short term and long term debt to meet its financing needs for the foreseeable future 
debt outstanding and debt capacity notes payable notes payable were million at november  this amount mainly represented various other short term borrowings that were not part of committed lines 
the weighted average interest rates on these short term borrowings were and percent in and  respectively 
long term debt long term debt consisted of senior notes and a term loan 
the senior notes bear a fixed interest rate  which averages percent and mature in the company is subject to prepayment penalties on the senior notes 
as of november   make whole premiums are estimated to be  if the entire debt were paid off  million 
the company currently has no intention to prepay any senior notes 
effective december   the company entered into a one year interest rate swap agreement for the term loan  for a fixed interest rate of percent 
the term loan matures in there are no prepayment penalties on the term loan 
see the below discussion regarding borrowings on the company s lines of credit 

table of contents lines of credit the company has a million revolving credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions at november  this credit agreement creates an unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that the company can draw upon for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement also contains an accordion feature  which allows the company to increase the aggregate credit facility size to up to million 
exercise of the accordion feature requires the approval of the consortium of financial institutions 
at the company s option  interest is payable at the london interbank offered rate libor plus percent

both the interest rate and the facility fee percentage are based on a rating grid 
the credit facility expires on december  as of november   the company had million drawn on its committed lines of credit 
at november   the company was in compliance with all covenants of its contractual obligations 
management believes the company has the ability to meet all of its contractual obligations and commitments in in september  the company registered with the sec to issue  at an indeterminate date  debt and equity securities with an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed million

as part of the shelf registration process  the company sought and obtained an investment grade rating bbb with a stable outlook from standard poor s 
as of november   there has been no change to this rating 
the shelf registration expired on december  goodwill and other intangible assets as of november   goodwill totaled million percent of total assets and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million percent of total assets

selected metrics of liquidity and capital resources key metrics monitored by management are net working capital as a percent of annualized net revenue  trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  inventory days on hand  free cash flow and debt capitalization ratio 
net working capital as a percentage of annualized net revenue accounts receivable dso days days inventory days on hand days days free cash flow million million debt capitalization ratio 
table of contents current quarter net working capital trade receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts plus inventory minus trade payables divided by annualized net revenue current quarter multiplied by four 
accounts receivable less the allowance for doubtful accounts at the balance sheet date multiplied by and divided by the net revenue for the quarter 
average inventory over last five quarters multiplied by and divided by cost of sales for prior months 
net cash provided by operations from continuing operations  less purchased property  plant and equipment and dividends paid 
total debt divided by total debt plus total stockholders equity 
another key metric introduced in was return on gross investment  or rogi 
the calculation takes gross cash flow divided by gross investment 
gross cash flow is defined as gross profit less sg a less taxes at a standard rate of percent plus depreciation and amortization expenses less maintenance capital expenditures defined as percent of total capital expenditures 
gross cash flow is calculated using trailing month information 
gross investment is defined as total assets plus accumulated depreciation less non debt current liabilities less cash 
rogi was introduced because management believes it provides a true measure of return on investment  it is a better way to internally measure performance and it is focused on the long term 
the rogi calculated at november  was percent as compared to percent at december  lower operating results and gross cash flow in as compared to contributed to the lower rogi 
the divestiture of the company s automotive business in had a positive impact on rogi 
the following table shows the rogi calculation based on the company s definition above compared to a calculation using all gaap based data 
management believes use of certain non gaap financial measures provides a better calculation of rogi because they eliminate fluctuations not specifically related to the return on the current investment base 
in millions rogi management calculation rogi gaap based calculation gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income taxes depreciation and amortization maintenance capital expenditures gross cash flow gross investment return on gross investment the rogi calculation for management measurement purposes uses a tax rate of 
the gaap rate is based on actual tax expense including any one time  discrete items 
maintenance capital expenditures used for the management calculation of rogi is percent of total depreciation expense whereas the gaap based amount is actual capital expenditures from the cash flow statement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by the unfavorable economic conditions 
continued or further recessionary economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the company s sales volumes  pricing levels and profitability 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending due to the recession in the domestic and international economies  or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the company s variable rate debt as of november  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of net revenue was generated outside of the united states in principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso  brazilian real and chinese renminbi 
management s objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 

table of contents management takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
management does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional details regarding the management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results  a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately million in net income or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
the company generally avoids sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  sustained strong economic growth in north america and china coupled with unplanned supplier production outages have led to strained supply demand situations for several key derivatives such as ethylene and propylene  some of their derivatives  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
in  the company s single largest expenditure was the purchase of raw materials 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
