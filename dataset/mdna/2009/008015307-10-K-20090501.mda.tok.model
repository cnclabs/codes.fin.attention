management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a is provided to help provide an understanding of our business  financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
our md a is organized as follows overview 
this section contains trend analysis  a summary of the challenges we encountered this fiscal year and steps we are taking to address these challenges 
this section may contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our current expectations and actual results may materially differ from such expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in item a 
risk factors 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of results of operations for the two fiscal years presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of cash flows  a discussion of outstanding debt  working capital and capital expenditures  and commitments  both firm and contingent  that existed as of january   and trends  demands  events and uncertainties with respect to our ability to finance our continuing operations 
critical accounting policies 
this section discusses the accounting policies i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
overview the trend in the aerospace industry is toward digital cockpits as the aerospace industry moves away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was our foundation 
in fiscal year  we made progress in acquiring the ability to manufacture digital instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems 
we have maintained our commitment to research and development to facilitate this upgrade in our product line as we anticipate further movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry 
we plan to position ourselves in a market niche where we have the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation 
while we believe that this strategy will  over time  strengthen our position in the aerospace industry  we cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful or that we will have access to the capital resources needed to fully support this strategy 
we also have significant business tied to military programs 
as a consequence  our business can fluctuate depending on government spending on military programs for which we supply our products 
while we have been successful in obtaining contracts to supply military needs in recent years  changes in government spending could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our future military business 
while we can not fully predict the outcome of the budget process  we do not expect that the change of administration in washington will have a significant impact on our business in the next few years 
we expect that the majority of the military programs we supply will be sustained at current or near current levels 
likewise  changes in the commercial sector of the aerospace industry can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our future business 
while we have historically invested heavily in product development for both funded and unfunded programs  oem requirements may change such that additional product development efforts will be necessary to maintain or increase our revenue in the aerospace industry 
with the recent economic conditions  several of our commercial customers have reduced their operations and manufacturing forecasts 
while this may be offset by increases in aftermarket support  it is likely that our business will be negatively affected until the economy recovers and our customers resume prior levels of production 

table of contents our fiscal year results of operations  working capital and liquidity were all negatively impacted by a number of factors including the following delays and inefficiencies in product production and shipment  production inefficiencies resulting from the interruption of business operations caused by the august  fire  cost incurred in conjunction with the closing of our earlysville  virginia facility  competition from larger more well capitalized companies  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses primarily related to our earlysville virginia consolidation and purchase of op tech 
we have commenced and will continue to take steps to address the challenges we encountered in fiscal year among these steps are the following we employed a new chief executive officer in fiscal year  we hired a new chief operating officer in fiscal  while realigning the manufacturing operation and personnel  we reviewed and eliminated many of our costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses  through active marketing efforts  we are attempting to sell our earlysville  virginia plant facility  and we are working to improve our production throughput and operating efficiency 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue for fiscal year decreased  or  to  when compared to  for fiscal year the decrease in sales is due primarily to the business interruption caused by the august  fire 
cost of sales for fiscal year decreased by  or  to  when compared to  for fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to reduced sales volume resulting from business interruptions caused by the august  fire 
gross margin increased from for the year ended january  to for the year ended january  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales is due to the improvements in operating efficiencies and reductions in manufacturing overhead associated with the consolidation of the company s operations which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our continued improvement in gross margin will require the following improving controls over the manufacturing process  planning inventory purchases and movement carefully  and reducing costs and inefficiencies in our operations through better resource management and improved accountability 
these initiatives will be complimented with a marketing and sales strategy that addresses the highly competitive environment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased  or  when compared to fiscal year this decrease was attributable to a decrease in costs in fiscal year associated with the consolidation of the earlysville  virginia s operations offset by costs associated with the august  fire 

table of contents the gain from casualty loss for fiscal year of  is attributable to the august  fire 
insurance proceeds of  were offset by the net book value of inventory and fixed assets destroyed in the fire of  and  respectively 
other expense for fiscal year increased  or  to  when compared to  for fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in net interest expense to  in fiscal year when compared to  in fiscal year caused by an increase in average net borrowings for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year income tax expense increased  to tax expense of  for fiscal year compared to a tax benefit of  for fiscal year this change was due to the valuation allowance reducing the deferred tax assets 
net loss increased  or  to  or of revenue for fiscal year from  or of revenue for fiscal year loss per share increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources we have incurred significant losses from operations which have adversely affected the company s ability to maintain adequate liquidity 
the company s challenge to maintain favorable repayment terms with certain of its suppliers  which  in addition to the impact of the august  fire  is making it difficult for the company to achieve full production 
the severe sales reduction for the third quarter of fiscal year has also negatively impacted cash provided by operations  although this has been partially offset by certain customer advances 
the company has also been unable to sell the earlysville  virginia facility  although active marketing efforts are continuing 
as a result  the company is currently experiencing significant liquidity shortfalls 
obtaining sufficient liquidity to i satisfy working capital requirements  ii repay customer advances  iii fulfill necessary capital spending and iv meet the company s debt obligations is dependent both on the realization of positive cash flows from operations and on obtaining alternative financing sources 
otherwise  the company will consider other alternatives to meet its cash requirements 
cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal year  a decrease in cash used of  when compared to cash used of  for fiscal year this total decrease in cash used is primarily attributable to decreases in cash used of  due to proceeds received in fiscal year from the company s insurer related to inventory lost in the august fire   due to accounts receivable reductions stemming from reductions in revenues as a result of the august fire  coupled with increased collection efforts 
 due to customer advances in fiscal year resulting from the august fire  and  due to a reduction of accrued expenses and other liabilities during fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulting from completion of the consolidation of the earlysville  virginia operations  offset by increases in cash used of  due to reductions of trade payables in fiscal year from proceeds of customer advances and proceeds from the company s insurer as a result of the august fire related to inventory lost in the fire  and  due to increased inventory purchasing levels in fiscal year of  when compared to inventory purchasing in fiscal year of  primarily resulting from product purchases in development of the op tech product line 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities increased  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to proceeds of  received in fiscal year from the company s insurer related to fixed assets lost in the august fire coupled with a payment in fiscal year of  in connection with the acquisition of op tech 
no such payment occurred in fiscal year cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was  compared to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year of  the change was attributable to net repayments in fiscal year of  on the revolving credit facility compared to net borrowings in fiscal year of  along with proceeds of  in fiscal year from the issuance of long term debt that did not occur in fiscal year  both of which were offset by reduced principle repayments of long term debt in fiscal year compared to fiscal year totaling  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity in fiscal year and beyond is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results 
failure to successfully achieve these results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations in the future  and could require implementation of curative measures  including raising capital  deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending  and or  if necessary  selling assets 
credit facilities our credit facilities are with wachovia bank 
in fiscal year  we increased the maximum amount available to us under our credit facilities with wachovia from  to  which included  and  term notes and a  revolving credit facility and delivered to wachovia two replacement promissory notes as follows i a renewal and future advance promissory note in the amount of  the future advance note  and ii a renewal and amended term promissory note in the amount of  the term note and together with the future advance note  the notes 
the future advance note is collateralized by our real estate in clearwater  florida 
the term note is collateralized by our real estate in earlysville  virginia 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by the company s assets  with the exception of the company s real estate located in earlysville  virginia and clearwater  florida 
the notes will mature on i with respect to the future advance note  september   and ii with respect to the term note  june  the interest rate on the revolving credit facility as well as on the notes is one month libor which was and at january   and january   respectively plus basis points 
the interest rate was not affected by the modification 
interest  when applicable  is to be paid monthly on the revolving credit facility 
interest and principal are paid monthly on the notes 
at january   there was  of available funds to be drawn on the revolving credit facility 
our long term debt agreements with wachovia contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including the requirement to maintain i at all times  a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that does not exceed to  and ii at the end of each fiscal quarter  a cash flow coverage ratio with regard to the debt service of at least to 
these financial covenants were not affected by the modification 
as of january  and we were not in compliance with the cash flow coverage ratio covenant and the total liabilities to tangible net worth covenant  however  wachovia has provided a written waiver of the non compliance to us through october  consequently  the entire amount of long term debt is classified as a current maturity at both january  and the other restrictive covenants  among other things  require us to obtain consent from the lender prior to making a material change of management  guarantee or otherwise become responsible for obligations of any other person or entity or assuming or becoming liable for any debt  contingent or direct  in excess of  these other restrictive covenants were also not affected by the modification 

table of contents working capital and capital expenditures our working capital deficit at january  was  compared to  at january  the reduction in working capital during fiscal year related to an increase in customer advances prompted by the august  fire  and a decrease in accounts receivable from reduced revenues coupled with improved collections  somewhat offset by an increase in inventory and decrease in accounts payable funded by the customer advances and accounts receivable collections 
the accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to days at january   compared to days at january  credit terms provided customers are consistent with those normally offered in our industry 
future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including research and development  expansion of product lines and other factors 
furthermore  we may need to develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments  which would require additional resources 
currently  negative cash flow from operations prohibits us from meeting these challenges through organic growth 
our capital expenditures for fiscal year were  compared to  for fiscal year historically  our capital budget has been intended to replace fixed asset equipment as needed and to take advantage of technological improvements that would improve productivity 
certain critical fixed chambers and testing equipment were lost in the august  fire 
the anticipated cost to replace these capital items is approximately  which is expected to occur during fiscal year inflation and changing prices our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the cost of key operating resources  including labor and raw materials 
substantial increases in cost of sales and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
while we are taking steps to mitigate our risk to rising prices with prudent purchasing practices and improving our inventory management techniques  there can be no assurance that future supplies of raw materials and labor will not fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control 
certain operating costs such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase at or above the general rate of inflation  and we may be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
off balance sheet arrangements we issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit loc in favor of the ministry of defense of the republic of korea in may in the amount of  this loc provides the south korean government with financial assurance that we will perform in accordance with the offset requirements under its contract to provide imfps for south korea s t military aircraft 
the offset requirements specify that we will effect a transfer of technology in accordance with the agreement 
this agreement is set to expire in july apart from this loc  we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of january  
table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents estimated cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of january  payments due by period less than one year one year to years greater than years to years after years total purchase commitments long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases total contractual obligations we have not included  of unrecognized tax benefits in the above table because we cannot estimate the period of future cash payments  if any  for this liability 
acquisitions on august  the closing date we purchased of the outstanding stock of op tech  an oregon based developer and manufacturer of cockpit glass display solutions  from optimization technologies  inc  an oregon corporation the seller 
the acquisition of op tech is consistent with our strategic plan for revenue growth into related industry markets 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method 
in connection with the acquisition  we  op tech  and the seller  along with certain holders of the seller s capital stock  entered into a share purchase agreement the spa  whereby we paid  to the seller 
the spa also provides for the seller to additionally receive i up to  payable in our common stock once we obtain certain federal certifications for op tech s products  subject to seller s delivery of a duly executed subscription agreement  which provides for the seller s receipt of such stock  and a duly executed lock up agreement  which prohibits a transfer by seller for two years from the date of issuance of such stock and ii up to  if certain sales targets  or greater are met with respect to op tech s products within three years of the closing date 
as of january   no additional consideration has been recorded  nor have the contingencies been met 
environmental matters in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility  we engaged an environmental consulting firm to survey the property for any possible soil or groundwater contamination 
this survey revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents 
as a result  of the initial and subsequent surveys  contamination treatment was determined to be necessary for an estimated total cost of  as determined by the environmental compliance specialist 
the company has capitalized these contamination treatment costs as an increase to property held for sale  net  since such costs will be incurred in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility and will not result in a carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value less cost to sell 
costs incurred during the year ended january  totaled  after the august  fire at our clearwater  florida facility  during a routine investigation by local environmental agencies the company was cited for several violations relating to the storage  handling and disposal of normal chemicals  solvents and paints used in our production facility 
a remediation effort for these violations has been submitted for approval and remediation is to commence early in fiscal year the anticipated costs of remediation and associated fines totaling  are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of january  and the resulting expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  
table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of those consolidated financial statements and this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure items  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and as a result of trends and uncertainties identified above under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and in item a 
risk factors 
further  such differences could be material 
set forth below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
we consider critical accounting policies to be those i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
additionally  the policies discussed below are critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are highly uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on business operations is discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we manufacture most of our products on a build to order basis and ship products upon completion 
we have a policy of strict adherence to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab in order to accurately state our revenues in each accounting period 
for certain situations  some judgment is required  but most sales have clear revenue recognition criteria 
revenue sources for product sales are largely from sales to commercial and government customers 
the majority of customer sales terms are fob origin  although some customer terms are fob destination 
for those customers where terms are origin  revenue is generally recognized upon shipment  unless additional prevailing factors would not be in accordance with the revenue recognition requirements of sab for those customers whose terms are destination  revenue is generally not recognized until goods arrive at the customers premises and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we experience a certain degree of sales returns that vary over time 
generally  such returns occur within no more than days after shipment by us to our customers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas revenue recognition when right of return exists  we are able to make a reasonable estimation of expected sales returns based upon history and as contemplated by the requirements of sfas for example  sales returns may occur if delivery schedules are changed by customers after products have shipped or if products are received by customers but do not meet specifications 
in such cases  customers may choose to return products to us 
absent such circumstances  customers do not have a right to return products when we have met all contractual obligations 
previously  we had established a sales return reserve that approximated an expected level of sales returns over a day period 
our experience  with respect to sales returns has changed in recent years such that a reserve for sales returns has been provided due to experience and the reasonable possibility that certain customers will continue with such charge backs 

table of contents accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses we continuously evaluate our customers and provide reserves for anticipated credit losses as soon as collection becomes compromised 
however  most of our customers are financially sound and our history of bad debts is relatively low 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations of the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory losses and residual value losses we value inventory at the lower of cost using a method that approximates the first in  first out method or net realizable value 
reviews of inventory quantities on hand have been conducted to determine if usage or sales history supports maintaining inventory values at full cost or if it has instead become necessary to record a provision for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we endeavor to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and consequently reported operating results 
work in process inventories we employ certain methods to estimate the value of work in process inventories for financial reporting purposes 
our practice has been to conduct cycle counts of inventory throughout the year 
generally  for items that are in process at the end of a fiscal year  we will make an estimate during the cycle counting process regarding the percentage of completion of such items in order to accurately reflect costs incurred to date on the production of the items that are still in process 
these estimates are affected by the nature of the operation at which the items are located at the time a physical inventory is conducted  and are subject to judgment 
this practice was employed for fiscal years and manufacturing overhead cost application we establish our inventoriable cost of manufacturing overhead by calculating our overhead costs as a percentage of direct labor and applying that percentage to direct labor that has been charged to inventory on a twelve month rolling average basis 
this application percentage is reviewed and adjusted annually 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax assets to the extent it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
long lived assets the useful lives of property  plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are land improvements years buildings and improvements years machinery and equipment years patterns  dies  and tools years furniture and fixtures years 
table of contents we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment and will record an impairment charge whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
as of january  and  we do not believe that any assets are impaired 
we will capitalize production costs for computer software that is to be utilized as an integral part of a product when both a technological feasibility is established for the software  and  b all research and development activities for the other components of the product have been completed 
amortization is charged to expense at the greater of the expected unit sales versus units sold or the straight line method for a period of three years from the date the product becomes available for general release to customers 
use of estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
these principles require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported and contingent amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  including such items as i inventory  restructuring and environmental costs  ii percentage of completion estimates  iii other miscellaneous accruals and iv valuation allowances for accounts receivable  inventory and deferred tax assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company was required to adopt the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning february  the adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to make an election to carry certain eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value  even if fair value measurement has not historically been required for such assets and liabilities under us gaap 
effective february   the company did not elect the fair value option for any instruments 
effective february   the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
upon adoption of fin  we have elected an accounting policy to classify accrued penalties and interest expense on underpayment of income taxes in our income tax provision 
upon adoption of fin  we accrued a liability to offset the uncertainty of realization of certain deferred tax assets related to extraterritorial income tax exclusions  and recorded a charge against beginning retained earnings of  including  and  of interest expense and penalties  respectively representing the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not issue or invest in financial instruments or their derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
our market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates pertaining to our borrowings under our existing debt facilities which require the payment of interest at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus basis 
table of contents points 
we therefore are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
any increase in these rates could adversely affect our interest expense 
the extent of market rate risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates is not quantifiable or predictable because of the volatility of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we use no derivative products to hedge or mitigate interest rate risk 
based on the outstanding balances on our credit facilities as of january   a increase in interest rates would cost us approximately  annually 
we purchase materials for use in our products based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the materials purchased can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to mitigate this risk  in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase agreements with reasonable terms 
we also have a market risk exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we have a limited number of purchase and sale transactions that are denominated in british pounds 
our strategy in managing this risk exposure is to match the timing of british pound denominated cash inflows and outflows 
for fiscal year  british pound denominated cash inflows were generally lower than respective outflows
