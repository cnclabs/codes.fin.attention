item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and uncertainties and elsewhere in this prospectus 
overview we commenced our exploration stage in january with the change in the management of the company 
from january until march  we were strictly a mineral exploration company 
beginning with the management appointments of john swallow and paul dircksen  the addition of randal hardy  our acquisition of a drilling services company  and the acquisition of butte highlands  we continue to advance our business plan 
prior to our new business model  the addition of new management  the purchase of timberline drilling formerly known as kettle drilling  and a more active and focused exploration division  the company had no reported revenues and accumulated losses 
while was a very challenging year for the company  the mining industry and the entire world economy  we are emerging from this period with what we believe to be a stronger  more focused  mineral exploration and drilling services business 
in spite of a dramatic reduction in revenues from our drilling services business  both in the united states and mexico  the company reduced its consolidated net loss when compared to the previous year 
our us operations were profitable in the two most recent quarters 
the year commenced with the emergence of the credit crisis  global deleveraging and ultimately  a significant global economic recession that adversely affected the plans of companies large and small including timberline 
in october  the company announced termination of its proposed agreement to acquire small mine development smd  a privately held underground mining and mine development contractor 
for most of the previous year  management had expended considerable effort  focus and expense on the acquisition process 
however  in these unprecedented market conditions  it proved extremely difficult to complete the acquisition of smd under acceptable terms 
therefore  we jointly agreed that the unpredictability in the economic climate presented too great of a risk to the company and our shareholders 
instead  the company announced plans to form a joint venture with smd for the advancement of our butte highlands gold project 
the company also announced in october the completion of a million debt equity financing to retire an million bridge loan facility and provide working capital 
see the discussion under the section heading management s discussion and analysis financial condition and liquidity below for a more detailed description of the financing 
in july the company finalized the operating agreement for the butte highlands gold project with highland mining  llc highland  an affiliate of smd 
timberline and highland agreed that highland will fund the development of the underground gold mine at butte highlands  and that smd will perform all development activities to advance the project to production 
under terms of the agreement  timberline will be carried to production by highland  and both timberline s and highland s percent share of costs will be paid out of proceeds from future mine production 
this agreement resulted in the creation of the butte highlands jv  llc bhjv  with timberline and highland each having a percent interest 
development for the mine has begun with the cutting of the mine portal following receipt of the company s exploration permit in august timberline and its joint venture partner are now authorized to construct exploration drifts  perform both surface and underground drilling  and extract a bulk sample 
the acreage that may be disturbed under the permit totals approximately acres  including acres for surface facilities 
the plan involves construction of exploration drifts approximately feet wide by feet high and  feet in length 
the drill program to further define and expand the resource anticipates drill holes from drill stations located throughout the drifts 
the drill holes will average feet in length for a total of approximately  feet of core drilling 
the plan also anticipates collecting a  ton bulk sample 
the underground development  exploration dr illing  and bulk sampling is anticipated to take approximately one year 
it continues to be the opinion of management that projects similar to butte highlands are a good fit for the current environment and the unique qualifications of our people and strategic partners 
as a result  the company has chosen to focus on late early stage development and near term production properties that have similar characteristics to the butte highlands gold project 
management forecast for key issues  challenges  and opportunities recap of goals and objectives our goals for were influenced by the impact of the global economic crisis 
we have focused our efforts in our drilling services businesses mainly on underground drilling for developing or producing companies 
while this strategy has allowed us to continue providing services to our largest customers  we have been and continue to be focused on right sizing the operations to fit the current demand in the industry 
there is still work to be done to make our drilling entities as profitable as we feel they have the potential to be 
we have  however  made what we believe is a tremendous amount of progress over the past year in improving operating cash flows  reducing debt  and attaining profitability even in the face of decreased revenues 
our mineral exploration goals for were to focus on nearer term production projects such as our butte highlands property 
as we announced early in the year  we successfully completed a joint venture operating agreement with an affiliate of smd that provides the company with a carried interest in butte highlands 
our exploration staff has spent most of their time in the past year working closely with smd in order to advance the project 
while butte highlands has been our primary exploration focus  we continue to evaluate new exploration opportunities  as well as maintaining our claims over several early stage exploration projects in our portfolio that we hope to be able to advance as the economy and our industry recover from the ongoing recession 
at the beginning of we stated our belief that the global economic environment and monetary situation favor a solid and relatively steady gold price for the foreseeable future 
this proved to be true  as gold prices remained relatively stable  with a modest uptrend recently moving prices to new all time highs 
while volatility in commodity prices  including gold  is to be expected  our view continues to be that our business model can be successful even at much lower gold prices than witnessed in the market at present 
we believe the global economic environment and monetary situation favor a solid and relatively steady gold price for the foreseeable future 
as a company we are focused on our drilling subsidiaries  advancing butte highlands and evaluating new opportunities 
we have evaluated a number of projects and opportunities and will continue to do so in our industry and the world have change d  and we anticipate a number of changes in the year ahead 
we will continue to look for opportunity at every turn 
as we have previously stated and firmly believe  our corporate objective is to provide investors with significant exposure to both the picks and shovels and blue sky aspects of our industry 
we believe that our business model is highly scalable and uniquely well positioned to take advantage of the environment that currently exists in the mining and exploration industries and provides us the flexibility to evaluate a wide range of opportunities going forward 
we feel we have the knowledge base to continue to evaluate opportunities either organically or through mergers and acquisitions and continue to do so 
drilling services timberline drilling and its subsidiary  world wide exploration sa de cv wwe  provide both surface and underground drilling services  with their two largest clients being newmont mining and exploraciones mineras penoles sa de sa  respectively 
both units specialize in underground  hard rock core drilling a niche business that we believe is well positioned as the industry continues to mature and exploration projects are advanced into producing mines 
our underground focus has provided a solid base of operations as a large percentage of the above ground and more speculative exploration drilling has been cut back and or delayed during the current industry slowdown 
revenue at both timberline drilling and wwe decreased considerably during the past year as a result of the global recession 
management has focused its efforts throughout the past year on matching our expenses with current rates of revenue to assure sustainable profitability from our drilling entities 
while there are still improvements to be made  our combined drilling entities were able to achieve profitability in the last two quarters of the fiscal year in spite of revenues that were over lower than in the previous year 
at timberline drilling  there is a significant liability on the company s balance sheet related to interest and penalties for late payment of payroll taxes for payrolls during the period from october  through may  this liability was generated during a period of substantial company growth when the drilling company s previous management team used available funds to pay other liabilities of the subsidiary rather than paying the payroll taxes and resulting penalties and interest 
while the company has repaid all outstanding payroll taxes owing from these periods during the year ending september   the company has recorded an accrual of  in unpaid penalties and interest as of september  the company has made timely payments on all payroll taxes since may  and has negotiated a payment plan with the irs relating to the unpaid interest and penalties owed 
in april  the c ompany began making monthly installment payments on the outstanding balance of interest and penalties 
during the year ended september   timberline drilling s assets became subject to a tax lien until all interest and penalties assessed by the irs are satisfied 
if the company fails to comply with the negotiated payment plan or is otherwise unable to pay the interest and penalties owed to the irs  the irs could force the sale of certain assets of timberline drilling to satisfy the interest and penalties due 
mineral exploration early in fiscal  the company announced plans to form a joint venture with smd for the advancement of our butte highlands project 
in july the company finalized the operating agreement for the butte highlands project with highland mining  llc highland  an affiliate of smd 
during the year we continued to advance the butte highlands project with additional geological evaluation and began an exploration drill program in july that concluded subsequent to our year end 
development for the butte highlands gold project has begun with the cutting of the portal following receipt of the company s exploration permit in august in the coming year  the butte highlands project focus will be on completion of a development ramp  additional drilling  and a  ton bulk sample 
during this time  timberline will be submitting an application for an operating permit with the montana department of environmental quality to commence gold mining operations 
timberline will be conducting or contracting all base line studies to facilitate the permit 
timberline expects that the permitting process will take approximately months 
therefore  timberline expects to transition from underground e xploration and development to gold mining operations 
the company expects that the total costs incurred by the joint venture on the project to reach production will be between and million 
our management and geologists remain committed to providing exploration blue sky and potential for discovery to our investors 
looking ahead  it is the opinion of management that our primary commodity focus should be on gold  and to a lesser extent on silver in the precious metals area 
furthermore  we believe that projects similar to butte highlands are a good fit for the current environment and the unique qualifications of our people  drilling subsidiaries and strategic partners 
we do not plan to expend significant capital or time on larger early stage exploration projects unless they can be done at a minimal cost to the company and not at the cost of advancing or acquiring more advanced stage properties 
we have evaluated  and will continue to evaluate  projects that fit our new focus 
results of operations for years ended september  and combined results timberline corporate  timberline exploration  timberline drilling and wwe for the year ended september   we reported  in revenue compared to  in fiscal our revenues are derived entirely from our drilling subsidiaries and are comprised of  from timberline drilling and  from wwe 
our revenue decrease was primarily due to a decreased number of drill rigs in service during the year 
gross profit from timberline drilling and wwe was  and  respectively for the year ended september  gross profit margins decreased from the previous year primarily as a result of the rapid slowdown in drilling activity during the first six months of the fiscal year 
in the last six months of the fiscal year we were able to rationalize our operating expenses to be more consistent with our decreased revenues and gross profit margins have returned to more typical levels for our drilling entities as of september  our overall after tax net loss for the year ended september  was  compared to an overall net loss of  for the year ended september  the reduced net loss compared to the prior year is primarily the result of reducing the amount expended by the company on mineral exploration as well as a reduction in salaries  benefits and severance expenses 
the reduction in these expenses was offset somewhat by lower gross margins on our operations as discussed above 
our net loss after income taxes for the year ended september  was comprised of a loss of  for timberline corporate and exploration  a loss of  for timberline drilling  and a loss of  at wwe 
our net loss after income taxes for the year ended september  was comprised of a loss of  for timberline corporate and exploration  and a loss of  for timberline drilling  offset by a gain of  at wwe timberline corporate and exploration division the after tax net loss of  combined for timberline corporate and the exploration division is comprised of exploration expenditures of  non cash charges of  professional fees expense of  other general and administrative costs of  and interest expense of  less interest income of  included in the non cash charges are  in expenses related to common stock issuances to employees and stock options that vested during the year 
also included in the non cash charges is  in depreciation and amortization 
the reduction in the after next loss for timberline corporate and the exploration division for the year ended september  as compared to the previous year s after tax net loss of  is primarily a result of significantly reduced expenditures on mineral exploration activities  in addition to reduced legal and accounting costs 
during the previous year the company incurred a significant amount of legal and accounting costs associated with our proposed acquisition of smd 
timberline drilling and wwe for the year ended september   timberline drilling had revenues of  as compared to  for the year ended september  wwe had revenues of  for the year ended september  as compared to  for the year ended september  both timberline drilling and wwe experienced reductions in revenue as a direct result of fewer core drilling rigs being in operation during the year as compared to the previous year 
for the year ended september   gross profit from timberline drilling and wwe was  and  respectively  as compared to  for timberline drilling and  for wwe for the year ended september  the reduction in gross profits is a function of lower drilling revenues in the year ended september  as well as higher operating expenses during the first two quarters of the year prior to the company rationalizing costs once it became clear that sharply reduced drilling activity would persist for a longer period of time 
timberline drilling and wwe had general and administrative expenses of  and  respectively  for the year ended september  as compared to  for timberline drilling and  for wwe for the year ended september  timberline drilling s general and administrative expenses include a recovery of  in severance costs accrued in the prior year related to the management transition that was undertaken during the year ending september  the decreased year over year general and administrative expenses at timberline drilling reflect a right sizing of the company s overhead costs in order to ensure that timberline drilling is a profitable entity even with lower revenues such as those experienced during the most recent fiscal year 
financial condition and liquidity at september   we had assets of  consisting of cash in the amount of  restricted cash of  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  in the amount of  materials and supplies inventory valued at  property  mineral rights  and equipment  net of depreciation of  goodwill related to the acquisition of timberline drilling in the amount of  and other assets of  the poor conditions in the us housing market and the credit quality of mortgage backed securities have continued in  causing a loss of confidence in the broader us and global credit and financial markets and resulting in the collapse of  and government intervention in  major banks  financial institutions and insurers and creating a climate of greater volatility  less liquidity  widening of credit spreads  a lack of price transparency  increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions 
these disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
while access to capital has improved recently  these disruptions could  among other things  make it more difficult for us to obtain  or increase our cost of obtaining  capital and financing for our operations 
our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect to rely upon the revenues generated by our mine services subsidiaries  however  the recent economic instability make it difficult for the company s management to accurately predict revenues from these services into the fiscal year 
if revenues from our mine services subsidiaries decline  our exploration activities and other operations will be reliant upon equity financings to continue into the future 
the current market conditions could make it difficult or impossible for us to raise necessary funds to meet our capital requirements 
if we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments  we will seek multiple solutions including  but not limited to  credit facilities or debenture issuances 
at september  the company has working capital of  compared to working capital of  at september  management expects to continue to maintain or increase the amount of working capital via continued improvements in operating cash flows at the company s drilling subsidiaries  reduction of exploration expenditures  reduced professional and consulting expenses  potential sales of capital assets and obtaining financing through equity investments 
subsequent to year end  as described below  the company raised  in proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants and a private placement of the company s common stock 
management expects to maintain or improve operating cash flows at the company s drilling subsidiaries by continuing to reduce hourly and salaried payroll expenses  reducing supplies inventory levels  and eliminating non essential general and administrative costs 
the company plans to continue curtailing exploration expenditures to focus on only our material exploration properties 
this curtailment is expected to include a reduction in geological staff salaries expense and reduced use of outside geological consultants 
finally  the company s capital assets include drills  drilling related equipment and vehicles for which a resale market exists 
the company will consider sales of a portion of these capital assets  if necessary  to fund working capital 
management believes that it has sufficient working capital to meet the company s ongoing operating expenses for the next months 
additional financing may be required if the company seeks to undertake further property acquisitions or expand its exploration or mine services operations 
financing activities on october   the company entered into two convertible notes as described below  one with ron guill  a director of the company  and his wife  stacey guill  and the other with smd  a company owned by mr

critical accounting policies and estimates see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report for a complete summary of the significant accounting policies used in the presentation of our financial statements 
the summary is presented to assist the reader in understanding the financial statements 
the accounting policies used conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows exploration expenditures all exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred 
significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized 
if no mineable ore body is discovered  previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period the property is abandoned 
revenue recognition the company recognizes drilling service revenues as the drilling services are provided to the customer based on the actual amount drilled for each contract on a per foot or per hour drilled basis 
in some cases  the customer is responsible for mobilization and stand by costs 
mobilization is charged to a customer when the company deploys its personnel and equipment to a specific drilling site 
stand by is charged to a customer when the company deploys its personnel and equipment to a specific drilling site  but for reasons beyond the company s control  drilling activities are not able to take place 
revenue related to reimbursement of mobilization and stand by costs is recognized in the same period as the costs of mobilization or stand by are incurred by the company 
the specific terms of each drilling job are agreed to by the customer and the company prior to the commencement of drilling 
cont ract losses are not recognized as the company s agreements with its customers do not put the company at risk of loss 
materials and supplies inventory inventories consist primarily of parts  operating supplies  drill rods and drill bits 
the company values its materials and supplies inventory  with the exception of drill rods  at the lower of average cost or market 
drill rods are valued using their average cost less an allowance for rod usage on a per foot drilled basis 
allowances are recorded for inventory considered to be in excess or obsolete 
review of carrying value of property and equipment for impairment the company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the property is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
goodwill goodwill relates to the acquisition of kettle drilling 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at least annually goodwill is tested for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in assessing the value of goodwill  assets and liabilities are assigned to the reporting units and a discounted cash flow analysis is used to determine fair value 
there was no impairment loss revealed by this test as of september  derivative financial instruments the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow  market  or foreign currency risks 
derivative financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value 
for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities  the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value  with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income 
for option based derivative financial instruments  we use the black scholes option pricing model to value the derivative instruments
