item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for details on these loans  were considered non performing and impaired 
during the year ended september   million had been charged off against the allowance for loan loss for the impaired construction loans 
interest income not recorded on non performing construction loans for the year ended september  was million 
before making a commitment to fund a construction loan  we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser 
we generally also engage an outside engineering firm to review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of a construction loan 
loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method 
we require a personal guarantee from each principal of all of our construction loan borrowers 
construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long term financing on improved  owner occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost including interest of construction and other assumptions 
if the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property 
additionally  if our estimate of the value of the completed property is inaccurate  our construction loan may exceed the value of the collateral 
commercial business loans 
at september   our commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans 
we make commercial business loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals  sole proprietorships and small and mid sized businesses 
our commercial business loans include term loans and revolving lines of credit 
the maximum term of a commercial business loan is years 
such loans are generally used for longer term working capital purposes such as purchasing equipment or furniture 
commercial business loans are made with either adjustable or fixed rates of interest 
the interest rates for adjustable commercial business loans are based on the prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
when making commercial business loans  we consider the financial strength of the borrower  our lending history with the borrower  the debt service capabilities of the borrower  the projected cash flows of the business and the value and type of the collateral 
commercial business loans generally are secured by a variety 
table of contents of collateral  primarily accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  savings instruments and readily marketable securities 
in addition  we generally require the business principals to execute personal guarantees 
commercial business loans generally have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans 
unlike residential mortgage loans  which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to repay the loan from his or her employment income  and which are secured by real property with ascertainable value  commercial business loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the borrower s business 
as a result  the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the borrower s business 
further  any collateral securing commercial business loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value 
we try to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards 
the maximum amount of a commercial business loan is limited by our loans to one borrower limit  which is of magyar bank s capital  or million currently 
at september   our largest commercial business loan was a million loan to a company that provides janitorial services and was secured by the accounts receivable of the company 
this loan was performing according to its terms at september  at september   all of our commercial business loans were performing in accordance with their terms with the exception of six non accrual loans totaling  interest income not recorded on non performing commercial business loans for the year ended september  was  during the year ended september    had been charged off against the allowance for loan loss for impaired commercial business loans 
home equity lines of credit and other loans 
we originate home equity lines of credit secured by residences located in our market area 
at september   these loans totaled million  or of our total loan portfolio 
the underwriting standards we use for home equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant s credit history  an assessment of the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations  the ongoing payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan 
the maximum combined first and second mortgage liens loan to value ratio for home equity lines of credit is 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest  indexed to the prime rate  as reported in the wall street journal  with terms of up to years 
the maximum amount of a home equity line of credit loan is limited by our loans to one borrower limit  which is of magyar bank s capital  or million currently 
at september   our largest home equity line of credit was a non performing  loan 
this loan was secured by a first lien position on two separate family residential properties on which the bank was in the process of foreclosure at september  at september   all other home equity lines of credit were performing in accordance with their terms with the exception of one non accrual loan totaling  during the year ended september    had been charged off against the allowance for loan loss for impaired home equity lines of credit 
interest income not recorded on non performing home equity lines of credit for the year ended september  was  we also originate loans secured by the common stock of publicly traded companies  provided their shares are listed on the new york stock exchange  the american stock exchange or the nasdaq stock market  and provided the company is not a banking company 
stock secured loans are interest only and are offered for terms up to twelve months and for adjustable rates of interest indexed to the prime rate  as reported in the wall street journal 
the loan amount is not to exceed of the value of the stock securing the loan at any time 
at september   stock secured loans totaled million  or of our total loan portfolio 
generally  we limit the aggregate amount of loans secured by the common stock of any one corporation to of magyar bank s capital  with the exception of johnson johnson  for which the collateral concentration limit is of magyar bank s capital 
at september   million  or of our loan portfolio  was secured by the common stock of johnson johnson  a new york stock exchange company that operates a number of facilities in our market area and employs a substantial number of residents 
although these loans are underwritten based on the ability of the individual borrower to repay the loan  the concentration of our portfolio 
table of contents secured by this stock subjects us to the risk of a decline in the market price of the stock and  therefore  a reduction in the value of the collateral securing these loans 
as of september   the aggregate loan to value ratio of the stock secured portfolio was 
loan originations  purchases  participations and servicing of loans 
lending activities are conducted primarily by our loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations 
all loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we originate both adjustable rate and fixed rate loans 
our ability to originate fixed or adjustable rate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans  which is affected by the current and expected future levels of market interest rates 
generally  we retain in our portfolio substantially all loans that we originate 
historically  we have not originated a significant number of loans for the purpose of reselling them in the secondary market 
in the future  however  to help manage our interest rate risk and to increase fee income  we may increase our origination and sale of fixed rate residential loans 
all one to four family residential mortgage loans that we sell in the secondary market are sold with servicing rights retained pursuant to master commitments negotiated with freddie mac 
we sell our loans without recourse 
no loans were held for sale at september  at september   we were servicing loans sold in the amount of million 
loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments  accounting for principal and interest  contacting delinquent mortgagors  supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults  making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans 
from time to time  we will also participate in loans  sometimes as the lead lender 
whether we are the lead lender or not  we underwrite our participation portion of the loan according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures 
at september   we had million of loan participation interests in which we were the lead lender  and million in loan participations in which we were not the lead lender 
we have entered into loan participations when the aggregate outstanding balance of a particular customer relationship exceeds our loan to one borrower limit 
all loan participations are loans secured by real estate that adhere to our loan policies 
we have not experienced any loan losses in our loan participations portfolio 
during the fiscal year ended september   we originated million of fixed rate and adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the fixed rate loans are primarily of loans with terms of years or less 
we also originated million of commercial real estate  million of construction loans  million of commercial business loans  and million of home equity lines of credit and other loans during the fiscal year ended september we generally do not purchase residential mortgage loans  except for loans to low income borrowers as part of our community reinvestment act lenders program 
at september   we had million of one to four family residential mortgage loans that were purchased from other lenders 
no loans were purchased in the fiscal year ended september  loan approval procedures and authority 
our lending activities follow written  non discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors 
in the approval process for loans  we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan 
to assess an individual borrower s ability to repay  we review income and expense  employment and credit history 
to assess a business entity s ability to repay  we review financial statements including balance sheets  income statements and cash flow statements  rent rolls  other debt service  and projected income and expense 
we generally require appraisals for all real estate securing loans 
appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers who are approved annually by our board of directors 
we require borrowers to obtain title  fire and casualty  general liability  and  if warranted  flood insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan 
for construction loans  we require a detailed plan and cost review  to be reviewed 
table of contents by an outside engineering firm  and all construction related state and local approvals necessary for a particular project 
our loan approval policies and limits are established by our board of directors 
all loans are approved in accordance with the loan approval policies and limits 
lending authorities are approved annually by the board of directors  and magyar bank lending staff members are authorized to approve loans up to their lending authority limits  provided the loan meets all of our underwriting guidelines 
loan requests for aggregate borrowings up to million must be approved by magyar bank s chief lending officer or president 
other members of our lending staff have lesser amounts of lending authority based on their experience as lending officers 
loan requests for aggregate borrowings up to of magyar bank s loans to one borrower limit  or million  must be approved by magyar bank s management loan committee

the directors loan committee must approve all loan requests for aggregate borrowings in excess of of magyar bank s loans to one borrower limit  or million 
the board of directors must approve all loan requests for aggregate borrowings in excess of of magyar bank s loans to one borrower limit  or million 
asset quality we commence collection efforts when a loan becomes days past due with system generated reminder notices 
subsequent late charge and delinquent notices are issued and the account is monitored on a regular basis thereafter 
personal  direct contact with the borrower is attempted early in the collection process as a courtesy reminder and later to determine the reason for the delinquency and to safeguard our collateral 
when a loan is more than days past due  the credit file is reviewed and  if deemed necessary  information is updated or confirmed and collateral re evaluated 
we make every effort to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they are delinquent for more than three months 
when loans are placed on non accrual status  unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed  and further income is recognized only to the extent received 
a summary report of all loans days or more past due is provided to the board of directors on a monthly basis 
if no repayment plan is in process  the file is referred to counsel for the commencement of foreclosure or other collection efforts 
non performing assets

as shown in the table above  at september   our troubled debt restructuring and total non performing assets increased to million from million at september  and million at september   reflecting the recent adverse economic conditions 
the repayment of the company s construction loan portfolio is dependent upon the sale of the collateral securing the loans and has been particularly impacted by the rapid deterioration in the housing market and decreased buyer demand 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of non performing assets 

table of contents additional interest income of approximately million and  would have been recorded during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively  if the non accrual loans summarized in the above table had performed in accordance with their original terms 
the company accounts for its impaired loans in accordance with general accepted accounting principles  which require that a creditor measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate except that  as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price less estimated costs of disposal  or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs of disposal if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
the company records cash receipts on impaired loans that are non performing as a reduction to principal before applying amounts to interest or late charges unless specifically directed by the bankruptcy court to apply payments otherwise 
the company continues to recognize interest income on impaired loans that are performing

table of contents real estate owned 
real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until sold 
when property is acquired it is recorded at fair market value at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition 
the company held million of real estate owned properties at september  and million of real estate owned properties at september  during the year ended september   the company completed a foreclosure of a catering facility securing a commercial real estate loan and recorded the real estate on its books for million 
in addition  the company received a deed in lieu of foreclosure for a single family home securing a residential mortgage loan and recorded the real estate on its books for  the company sold one of the six lots it held in rumson  new jersey and accepted deposits to purchase two other lots in the amount of million during the year ended september   which reduced the carrying balance in real estate owned at september  from million to million at september  the company did not incur any further write downs on properties foreclosed upon during the year ended september  further declines in real estate values may result in a charge to expense in the future 
routine holding costs are charged to expense as incurred and improvements to real estate owned that enhance the value of the real estate are capitalized 
classified assets 
federal banking regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered un collectible and of such little value their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
we classify an asset as special mention if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management s close attention 
while such assets are not impaired  management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed  the value of the asset may deteriorate  adversely affecting the repayment of the asset 
on the basis of our review of assets at september   classified assets consisted of million of special mention assets  million of substandard assets and  of doubtful assets at september  we are required to establish an allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans classified substandard or doubtful  as well as for other problem loans 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities  but which  unlike impairment allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when we classify problem assets  we are required to determine whether or not impairment exists 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that magyar bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when it is determined that impairment exists  a specific allowance for loss is established 
for collateral dependent loans  the loan is reduced by the impairment amount via a reduction to the loan and the allowance for loan loss 
our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the new jersey department of banking and insurance and the federal deposit insurance corporation which can direct us to establish additional loss allowances 
the loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
not all classified assets constitute non performing assets 

table of contents allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management deems necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable 
management  in determining the allowance for loan losses  considers the losses in our loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable  and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities  along with the general economic and real estate market conditions 
the allowance for loan losses as of september  was maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable 
however  this analysis process is inherently subjective  as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available 
although we believe we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses  future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment 
in addition  as an integral part of their examination process  the new jersey department of banking and insurance and the federal deposit insurance corporation will periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination

table of contents investments our board of directors has adopted our investment policy 
this policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest 
the investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to approval by our board of directors 
while general investment strategies are developed by the asset and liability committee  the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our president and our chief financial officer 
they are responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the investment policy are followed and only prudent securities are considered for investment 
they are authorized to execute transactions that fall within the scope of the established investment policy up to million per transaction individually or million per transaction jointly 
investment transactions in excess of million must be approved by the asset and liability committee 
investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the board of directors at their regularly scheduled meetings 
our investments portfolio may include us treasury obligations  debt and equity securities issued by various government sponsored enterprises  including fannie mae and freddie mac  mortgage backed securities  certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions  overnight and short term loans to other banks  investment grade corporate debt instruments  and municipal securities 
in addition  we may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations and not in excess of magyar bank s tier capital 
the investment policy requires that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner  and purchase and sale decisions be based upon a thorough analysis of each security to determine its quality and inherent risks and fit within our overall asset liability management objectives 
the analysis must consider the effect of an investment or sale on our risk based capital and prospects for yield and appreciation 
at september   our securities portfolio totaled million  or of our total assets 
securities are classified as held to maturity or available for sale when purchased 
at september   million of our securities were classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost  and million were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
at september   we held no investment securities classified as held for trading 
us government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations 
at september   our us government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations totaled million  or of our total securities portfolio 
of this amount  million were debt securities issued by fannie mae and million were debt securities issued by freddie mac 
while these securities generally provide lower yields than other securities in our securities portfolio  we hold these securities  to the extent appropriate  for liquidity purposes and as collateral for certain borrowings 
we invest in these securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense  and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by these issuers 
mortgage backed securities 
we purchase mortgage backed pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities insured or guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae 
to a lesser extent  we also invest in mortgage backed securities issued or sponsored by private issuers 
at september   our mortgage backed securities  including cmos  totaled million  or of our total securities portfolio 
included in this balance was million of mortgage backed securities issued by private issuers 
our policy is to limit purchases of privately issued mortgage backed securities to non high risk securities rated aaa by a nationally recognized credit rating agency 
high risk securities generally are defined as those exhibiting significantly greater volatility of estimated average life and price due to changes in interest rates than year fixed rate securities 
mortgage backed pass through securities are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages 
mortgage backed pass through securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single family or multi family mortgages 
as loan payments are made by the borrowers  the principal and interest portion of the payment is passed through to the investor as received 
cmos are also backed by mortgages 
however they differ from mortgage backed pass through securities because the principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages are structured so that they 
table of contents are paid to the security holders of pre determined classes or tranches at a faster or slower pace 
the receipt of these principal and interest payments  which depends on the estimated average life for each class  is contingent on a prepayment speed assumption assigned to the underlying mortgages 
variances between the assumed payment speed and actual payments can significantly alter the average lives of such securities 
mortgage backed securities and cmos generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
however  mortgage backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings and other liabilities 
mortgage backed securities present a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security  which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments that can change the net yield on the securities 
there is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if the securities are redeemed by the issuer 
in addition  the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
our mortgage backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of at september  the estimated fair value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio at september  was million  which was  less than the amortized cost of million 
mortgage backed securities in magyar bank s portfolio do not contain sub prime mortgage loans 
corporate and other securities 
at september   we held million in bonds issued by corporations and  in bonds issued by the state of new jersey 
they are classified as held to maturity with a total amortized cost value of million  or of our total securities portfolio 
our investment policy allows for the purchase of such instruments and requires that corporate debt obligations be rated in one of the four highest categories by a nationally recognized rating service 
we may invest up to of magyar bank s investment portfolio in corporate debt obligations and up to of magyar bank s capital in any one issuer 
equity securities 
at september   we held no equity securities other than million in federal home loan bank of new york stock 
the investment in federal home loan bank of new york stock is classified as a restricted security  carried at cost and evaluated for impairment 
equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and stock market fluctuations 
such investments other than the federal home loan bank of new york are carried at their fair value and fluctuations in the fair value of such investments  including temporary declines in value  directly affect our net capital position

deposits  primarily certificates of deposit  have traditionally been the primary source of funds used for our lending and investment activities 
we obtain certificates of deposit primarily through our branch network and to a lesser extent via the brokered cd market 
we also use borrowings  primarily federal home loan bank advances  to supplement cash flow needs  to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management and to manage our cost of funds 
additional sources of funds include principal and interest payments from loans and securities  loan and security prepayments and maturities  income on other earning assets and stockholders equity 
while cash flows from loans and securities payments can be relatively stable sources of funds  deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates  market conditions and levels of competition 
deposits 
our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area 
we offer a selection of deposit accounts  including demand accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  retirement accounts and certificates of deposit 
deposit account terms vary  with the principal differences being the minimum balance required  the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate

personalized customer service  long standing relationships with customers and an active marketing program are relied upon to attract and retain deposits 

table of contents the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition 
the variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand 
based on experience  we believe that our deposits are relatively stable 
however  the ability to attract and maintain deposits  and the rates paid on these deposits  has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions

risk factors changes in interest rates may hurt our profits and asset values 
our earnings largely depend on our net interest income  which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time 
while we have taken steps to attempt to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  historically our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets 
this imbalance can create significant earnings volatility  because market interest rates change over time 
in a period of rising interest rates  the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities 
likewise  in a period of falling interest rates  the interest expense paid on our liabilities may not decrease as rapidly as the interest income received on our assets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management of market risk 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage backed securities 
a reduction in interest rates causes increased prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities as borrowers tend to refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs 
this creates reinvestment risk  which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
changes in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest earning securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates 
at september   the fair value of our total securities portfolio was million 
unrealized net losses on securities totaled  on a pre tax basis at september  we evaluate interest rate sensitivity using models that estimate the change in magyar bank s net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
at september   in the event of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates  the model projects that we would experience an  or  decrease in net interest income in the first year following the change in interest rates  and a million  or  increase in net interest income in the second year following the change in interest rates 
at september   in the event of an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates  the model projects that we would experience a  or  increase in net interest income in the first year following the change in interest rates  and a  or  increase in net interest income in the second year following the change in interest rates 
at september   our available for sale securities portfolio totaled million  which included million of mortgage backed securities 
to the extent interest rates increase and the value of our available for sale portfolio decreases  our stockholders equity will be adversely affected 
because we intend to continue our emphasis on the origination of commercial business and commercial real estate  our lending risk may increase 
at september   our portfolio of commercial business and commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of our total loans  compared to million or of our total loans at september  and million or of our total loans at september  it is our intent to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial business and commercial real estate loans 
commercial business and commercial real estate loans generally have more risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
at september   our non performing loans increased to million from million at september   reflecting our increased originations of these loans as well as construction loans 
in 
table of contents addition  because the repayment of these loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower s properties or related businesses  repayment of these loans has been and may continue to be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy 
further  these loans typically have larger loan balances  and several of our borrowers have more than one commercial business and commercial real estate loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
finally  if we foreclose on a commercial business or commercial real estate loan  our holding period for the collateral  if any  typically is longer than for one to four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral 
because we plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these loans  it may be necessary to increase our allowance for loan losses because of the increased credit risk associated with these types of loans 
any increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings 
the financial sector is experiencing an economic downturn 
a deterioration of our current non performing loans or an increase in the number of non performing loans will have an adverse effect on our operations 
virtually all of our real estate loans are secured by real estate in new jersey 
at september   loans secured by real estate  including home equity loans and lines of credit  represented of our total loans 
both nationally and in the state of new jersey we are experiencing an economic downturn that is having a significant impact on the prices of real estate and related assets 
the residential and commercial real estate sectors have been adversely affected by weakening economic conditions and may negatively impact our loan portfolio 
total troubled debt restructuring and total non performing assets increased from million at september  to million at september   troubled debt restructuring and total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets increased to at september  as compared to at september  if loans that are currently non performing further deteriorate or loans that are currently performing become non performing loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses  which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our fdic premium could be substantially higher in the future  which would have an adverse effect on our future earnings 
our fdic insurance assessment was million for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal our fdic assessment could be substantially higher in future periods depending on the premium rates set by the fdic for such periods and the composite rating assigned to the bank by the fdic 
any increases in our fdic premium rates will reduce future earnings 
our profits have declined over the past three years  and may not improve in the foreseeable future 
over the past three years  in addition to losses related to higher non performing loans  our earnings have declined as a direct result of our branch expansion  the relocation of our headquarters office  and the addition of experienced senior lending and administrative personnel 
we plan to add additional new branches 
it is possible that our business plan will not succeed  or that our new branches  when added  will not become profitable 
accordingly  we may not experience any improvement in our net income in the near future as a result of these efforts 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  requiring additions to our allowance  which could materially decrease our net income 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans and of total non performing loans at september  we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loss and 
table of contents delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
based on this review  we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses in our loan portfolio as of september  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
in our market area  we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we  have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area 
the greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview magyar bancorp  inc the company is a delaware chartered mid tier stock holding company whose most significant business activity is ownership of of the common stock of magyar bank 
magyar bank s principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits  together with funds generated from operations  principal repayments on loans and securities and borrowed funds  into one to four family residential mortgage loans  multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  commercial business loans and construction loans 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest income is primarily affected by the market interest rate environment  the shape of the us treasury yield curve  the timing of the placement of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets 
other factors that may affect our results of operations are general and local economic and competitive conditions  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
in connection with the completion of our initial public stock offering on january   magyar bancorp  inc sold  shares of common stock  or of its outstanding common stock  at a price of per share  to subscribers in the offering 
magyar bancorp  mhc  the company s new jersey chartered mutual holding company parent  holds  shares  or  of the company s outstanding common stock 
the company also contributed  in cash and issued  shares of common stock  or of its outstanding shares  to the magyarbank charitable foundation 
net proceeds from the initial offering were million including million in stock contributed to the charitable foundation of which the company contributed million to magyar bank 
during the year ended september   we grew net loans million  or 
we attribute this growth to an expanding referral network and reputation resulting from our continued focus on originating 
table of contents commercial real estate  commercial business  and residential mortgage loans 
deposits increased million  or  during the year ended september  we attribute this growth to the expansion of our commercial relationships  which tend to hold larger deposit balances  business development efforts by our retail branch managers  the continued growth of the bank s two newest branch facilities  and the adverse economic conditions that have resulted in a higher national savings rate 
we reported a net loss of million for the year ended september  net loss increased million for the year ended september  compared with the year ended september   primarily due to larger provisions for loan losses 
provisions were increased to million during the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september  due to higher levels of non performing loans  adverse economic conditions that resulted in depreciation of collateral values securing construction and commercial loans  and higher levels of loan charge offs during the current period 
our net interest margin decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  and our net interest spread was and for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the lower net interest margin and net interest spread were attributable to higher levels of non performing assets in the current year period  as well as significant declines in market interest rates that negatively impacted yields on assets during the first half of the bank s year ended september  throughout  we expect to continue with our strategy of diversifying our balance sheet with higher concentrations in family residential mortgage  commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies may involve complex subjective decisions or assessments 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan loss 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover credit losses in the loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical 
due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses  the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management 
as a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic and industry concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 

table of contents the evaluation has a specific and general component 
the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as impaired through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system 
all such loans are evaluated individually  with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan and discounted cash flows 
specific impairment allowances are established as required by this analysis  however  the bank s federal and state regulators generally require that the specific reserve against impaired loans be charged off  reducing the carrying balance of the loan and allowance for loan loss 
the general component is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations in establishing the general portion of the reserve 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 
actual loan losses may be significantly greater than the allowances we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
deferred income taxes 
the company records income taxes using the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities i are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns  ii are attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and iii are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance for all portions determined not likely to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment 
the valuation allowance is adjusted  by a charge or credit to income tax expense  as changes in facts and circumstances warrant 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september total assets 
total assets increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   due primarily to significant growth in loans receivable and securities held to maturity  partially offset by a decrease in securities available for sale 
loans receivable 
net loans receivable increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  during the year ended september   one to four family residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to million 
in addition  commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans increased million  or  and million  or  to million and million  respectively 
construction loans increased  or  to million at september  from million at september  at september   the significant loan categories in terms of the percent of total loans were in one to four family residential mortgage loans  in commercial real estate loans and in construction loans 
the remaining total loans were comprised of of commercial business  of home equity lines of credit and of other loans  which consisted primarily of stock secured consumer loans 
total non performing loans increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the total non performing loans consisted of thirteen construction loan relationships totaling million  seven commercial real estate loans totaling million  nine mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaling million  two home equity lines of credit totaling million and six commercial business loan totaling  adverse economic conditions have led to an increase in non performing loans  particularly in the company s construction loan portfolio 
the repayment of construction loans is typically dependent upon the sale of the collateral securing the loan  which has been negatively impacted by rapid deterioration in the housing 
table of contents market and decreased buyer demand 
as a result  construction projects have slowed and reached their maturity dates 
in order for the company to extend the loans beyond the original maturity date  the value of the collateral securing the loan must be assessed  which is typically done by obtaining an updated third party appraisal 
given the deterioration in the economy and  specifically  the housing market  updated valuations of the collateral reflect depreciation from earlier assessments 
to the extent that an updated valuation of the collateral is insufficient to cover a collateral dependent loan  the company reduces the balance of the loan via a charge to the allowance for loan loss 
non performing construction loans increased million to million at september  from million at september  at september   three non performing construction loans totaling million were secured by real estate in newark  new jersey 
the real estate securing these loans ranged from vacant and partially completed residential lots to a substantially completed unit townhome project 
in addition to these projects  there were ten non performing loans totaling million used for land acquisition and construction in various locations in the state of new jersey 
magyar bank is determining the proper course of action to collect the principal outstanding on these loans 
year to date  magyar bank had charged off million in non performing construction loan balances through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss 
construction loans may contain interest reserves on which the interest is capitalized to the loan 
at september   there were six performing construction loans with interest reserves representing outstanding balances of million  original interest reserves of million  advanced interest reserves of  and remaining interest reserve balances of million 
at september   there were fourteen performing construction loans with interest reserves representing outstanding balances of million  original interest reserves of million  advanced interest reserves of million  and remaining interest reserve balances of million 
underwriting for construction loans with and without interest reserves has followed a uniform process 
construction loan progress is monitored by loan on a monthly basis by management of the bank as well as by the board of directors 
each time an advance is requested  an inspection is made of the project by an outside engineer or appraiser  depending on the size and complexity of the project  to determine the amount of work completed and if the costs to date are supported adequately 
the bank s construction loan operations personnel compare the advance request with the original budget and remaining loan funds available to ensure the project is in balance and that at all times the amount remaining on the loan is sufficient to complete the project 
a number of the bank s construction loans have been extended due to slower sales as a result of worsening economic conditions 
in cases where updated appraisals reflect collateral values insufficient to cover the loan  additional collateral and or a principal reduction is required to extend the loan 
some of the bank s loans that originally had interest reserves are non performing 
the bank does not have any currently non performing loans with active interest reserves 
once a loan is deemed impaired  any interest reserve is frozen and the loan is placed on non accrual so that no future interest income is recorded on these loans 
the bank ceased originating new non owner occupied construction loans in october non performing commercial real estate loans increased million to million at september  from million at september  however  during the year ended september   magyar bank completed the foreclosure of a million catering facility  which would have reduced the balance of non performing commercial real estate loans at september  were it not for six new non performing loans totaling million 
magyar bank had begun foreclosure proceedings on the properties as of september  year to date  magyar bank had charged off million in non performing commercial real estate loan balances through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss 
non performing loans secured by one to four family residential properties including home equity line of credit loans increased million to million at september  from million at september  of these non performing loans  three loans totaling million were made to a investment property manager that had been negatively impacted by the downturn in the real estate market

table of contents had charged off  in non performing loans secured by one to four family residential properties through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss 
non performing commercial business loans increased  to  at september  from  at september  of the six non performing loans  two loans totaling  were secured by real estate collateral as an abundance of caution while four loans totaling  were unsecured

year to date  magyar bank had charged off  in non performing commercial business loans through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans receivable was at september  compared with at september  accordingly  the allowance for loan losses increased million to million or of non performing loans at september  compared with million or of non performing loans at september  provisions for loan loss during the year ended september  were million while net charge offs were million

table of contents balance of loans was more than offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on such loans to from 
the decline in yield on loans reflected an increased amount of non performing loans and an overall lower interest rate environment for loans during the year ended september  compared with the year ended september interest earned on investment securities  excluding federal home loan bank of new york stock  increased  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the prior year 
the increase was due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of such securities to million from million for the prior year as well as a basis point decrease in the average yield on securities to from for the prior year period 
the increased average balance of our investment securities reflected the redeployment of cash from deposits  which increased million during the year ended september  interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of such liabilities of basis points to from in the lower market interest rate environment

this resulted in a million  or  decrease in interest paid on deposits to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  interest paid on advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  despite an increase in the average balance of advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in advance interest expense was due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowings to for the year ended september  from for the prior year 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to earnings  at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group information and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur 
after an evaluation of these factors  management made a provision of million for the year ended september  compared with a million provision for the prior year 
provisions for loan loss increased million due primarily to higher level of non performing loans  adverse economic conditions resulting in the depreciation of collateral values securing construction and commercial loans  and higher level of loan charge offs during the current year 
there were net charge offs of million for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of million for the year ended september  the higher level of loan charge offs resulted from depreciation of real estate collateral securing commercial and construction loans due to the current adverse economic environment 
non performing loans increased million to million at september  from million at september  the allowance for loan losses increased million to million  or of gross loans outstanding at september   from million  or of gross loans outstanding at september  
table of contents other income 
non interest income increased million  or to million at september  from million the same period last year 
the increase in non interest income was primarily due to a million increase in gains on the sales of assets 
all other elements of other income were little changed at million for both years 
the company s gains from the sales of available for sale securities increased million to million for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the gains resulted from sales of mortgage backed securities and municipal bonds in the current lower interest rate environment 
the company s gains on the sales of mortgage loans increased  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the company sold twenty seven residential mortgage loans  servicing retained  totaling million to freddie mac during the year ended september  there were no losses on the sales of real estate owned for the year ended september  compared with  in losses for the prior year period 
other expenses 
other expenses increased  or to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to higher fdic insurance premiums paid during the year ended september  compared with the prior year period  offset by lower compensation  benefit and occupancy expenses 
the fdic substantially increased its assessment rate for all insured banks and charged a special assessment in in an effort to increase its reserve ratio  resulting in an increased expense of  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  compared with  for the year ended september  in addition to significantly higher annual assessment rates  the fdic announced a special assessment on all insured institutions equal to the lesser of of deposits or of assets minus tier equity 
included with the current year s expense was a one time  payment for the special assessment 
in the continued wake of bank failures  it is likely that the fdic assessment will be increased further and that there may be a second additional assessment in the company s next fiscal year 
employee and benefit expenses decreased  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was the result of reductions in the number of bank staff  benefits  such as k matches and employee stock ownership plan contributions  incentive expenses  and conference and convention expenses 
occupancy expense decreased  or to million for the year ended september  from million for the prior year period 
the decrease primarily reflected reduced expenses related to the building maintenance and the depreciation of fixed assets 
professional fees increased  or  to  during the year ended september  from the prior year period 
the increase in professional fees was primarily due to higher expenses related to the collection of non performing loans and the foreclosure of collateral securing non performing loans 
all other categories of other expense increased  or  to remain at million for the years ended september  and income tax expense 
the company recorded tax expense of  for the year ended september  compared with tax expense of  for the twelve months ended september  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company considers the likelihood that part or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires significant judgment and estimates 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
the company considers our history of losses  scheduled reversal of tax assets and liabilities  deferred tax planning strategies  if any  and projected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset items are deductible 
the company has incurred a net loss for the year ended september  and therefore has prevented us from reaching the more likely than not conclusion required under the applicable literature to recognize deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance 
table of contents sheet 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets not related to accumulated other comprehensive loss were fully offset by valuation allowances at september  and september  management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset and liability management committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset and liability committee meets at least on a quarterly basis to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by retaining in our loan portfolio fewer fixed rate residential loans  by originating and retaining adjustable rate loans in the residential  construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios  by using alternative funding sources  such as advances from the federal home loan bank of new york  to match fund longer term residential and commercial mortgage loans  and by originating and retaining variable rate home equity and short term and medium term fixed rate commercial business loans 
we have also increased money market account deposits as a percentage of our total deposits 
money market accounts offer a variable rate based on market indications 
finally  we have purchased interest rate floors and sold securities under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives to mitigate the impact of interest rates on our prime based loans 
at september  we held interest rate floors with a notional amount of million and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives in the amount of million 
by following these strategies  we believe that we are well positioned to react to changes in market interest rates 
net interest income analysis 
the table below sets forth  as of september   the estimated changes in our net interest income for each of the next two years that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
these estimates require making certain assumptions including loan and mortgage related investment prepayment speeds  reinvestment rates  and deposit maturities and decay rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions 
further  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a liquidity ratio of of assets or greater 
the liquidity ratio is calculated by determining the sum of the difference between liquid assets cash and unpledged investment securities and short term liabilities estimated day deposit outflows  borrowing capacity from the fhlbny  and brokered deposit capacity and dividing the sum by total assets 
at september   our liquidity ratio was of assets 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity from sales  totaled million at september  at september   we also had the ability to borrow million from the federal home loan bank of new york 
on that date  we had an aggregate of million in advances outstanding 
finally  the brokered certificate of deposit market offers an additional option for wholesale funding 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our statements of cash flows included in our financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan origination commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  that based on past experience a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 

table of contents our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities 
for the year ended september   we originated million of loans and purchased million of securities 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended september  and a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended september  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of new york  which provide an additional source of funds 
federal home loan bank advances totaled million and million at september  and september   respectively 
federal home loan bank advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand 
our current asset liability management strategy has been to fund variable  prime based loans with federal home loan bank overnight advances 
magyar bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at september   magyar bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
magyar bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see supervision and regulation federal banking regulation capital requirements 
bank owned life insurance is a tax advantaged financing transaction that is used to offset employee benefit plan costs 
policies are purchased insuring directors and officers of magyar bank using a single premium method of payment 
magyar bank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies and records tax free income through cash surrender value accumulation 
we have minimized our credit exposure by choosing carriers that are highly rated and limiting the concentration of any one carrier 
the investment in bank owned life insurance has no significant impact on our capital and liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by us 
for additional information  see note p  lease commitments  and note q financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to our financial statements 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at september  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments
