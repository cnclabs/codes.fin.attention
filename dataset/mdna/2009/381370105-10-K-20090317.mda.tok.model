financial information about geographic areas during the years ended december  and  we operated primarily in the united states 
we had no material foreign operations in and employees as of february   we had employees  including hourly rate employees 
the number of hourly rate employees fluctuates depending upon the number and size of projects under construction at any particular time 
we have no unionized employees and believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
electrical construction through our subsidiary  southeast power corporation southeast power  we are engaged in the construction and maintenance of electrical facilities for utilities and industrial customers 
we also install fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
southeast power  based in titusville  florida  performs electrical contracting services in the southeastern  mid atlantic and western regions of the united states 
our electrical construction business includes the construction of transmission lines  distribution systems and substations and other electrical installation services for utility systems and industrial and specialty projects  including fiber optic cable installation which is primarily overhead optical ground wire and all dielectric self supporting cable 
our customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve 
representative customers include florida power light company central electric power cooperative department of energy washington area power administration m a electric power cooperative kissimmee utilities authority jea formerly jacksonville electric authority santee cooper south carolina public service authority orlando utilities commission historically  a significant portion of our revenue has come from several different customers each year 
our largest customers may change from year to year 
in the year ended december   our top three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
since the contribution of a customer may vary from year to year  we cannot predict the future effect of the loss of any given customer 
it is our policy to commit ourselves only to the amount of work we believe we can properly supervise  equip and complete to the customer s satisfaction and schedule 
as a result of this policy and the magnitude of some of the construction projects undertaken by us  a substantial portion of our annual revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  the specific identity of which vary from year to year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail on sales to major customers which exceed of total sales 
construction is customarily performed pursuant to the plans and specifications of customers 
we generally supply the management  labor  equipment and tools  while materials are primarily supplied by our customers 
most projects have a duration of six months or less  although some contracts may extend beyond one year 

table of contents revenue and results of operations in our electrical construction business can be subject to seasonal variations 
these variations are influenced by weather  customer spending patterns and system loads 
the company primarily performs work in the southeastern united states 
electric utility customers normally perform their system upgrades and maintenance work during off peak seasons when the demand for electrical power is reduced  which is in the first two quarters of the year in the southeast region of the united states 
this pattern is typically reflected by a reduction in the number of our active projects in the third quarter 
however  since hurricane season normally peaks during the third quarter  this reduction can be offset with storm restoration work resulting from hurricane damage 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
competitive factors include level of technical expertise and experience  industry reputation  quality of work  price  geographic presence  dependability  availability of skilled personnel  worker safety and financial stability 
our management believes that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that our competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services  or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
we enter into contracts on the basis of either competitive bidding or direct negotiations with our customers 
competitively bid contracts account for a majority of our electrical construction revenue 
although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken  such contracts typically involve lump sum fixed price  or unit price time and material contracts 
however  many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services  and many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
the magnitude and duration of projects undertaken by us vary  which may result in substantial fluctuations in our backlog from time to time 
backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
our backlog also includes certain service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
the projected backlog amounts for these service agreement contracts are based on our historical work from these customers 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 
our backlog at december  was million  of which million is believed to be firm due to the nature of our fixed priced contracts and million of which is attributable to service agreements 
of our total backlog  is reasonably expected to be completed by december  this compares to a backlog of million as of december  of which million was believed to be firm from fixed priced contracts and million of which was attributable to service agreements 
in certain circumstances  we are required to provide performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety to secure our contractual commitments 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
management is not aware of any performance bonds issued for us that have ever been called by a customer 
we currently believe that we will not have to fund any claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
we believe that we have adequate bonding availability for our operations as presently conducted 
as of december   outstanding performance bonds issued on behalf of our electrical construction subsidiary amounted to million 
generally  our customers supply most or all of the materials required for a particular contract and we provide the personnel  tools and equipment to perform the installation services 
however  with respect to a portion of our contracts  we may supply part or all of the materials required 
in these instances  we are not dependent upon any one source for the materials that we customarily utilize to complete the job 
we are not presently experiencing  nor do we anticipate experiencing  any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of materials 
we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes and rules regarding  among other things  contractor licensing  electrical codes  worker safety and environmental protection 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
the main administrative and maintenance facilities of southeast power are located on a acre tract of land near titusville  florida  which we own 
the office building is approximately  square feet 
the shop and maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 
the south carolina division of southeast power owns its administrative and maintenance facilities  which are located on a acre tract of land in spartanburg  south carolina 
the office building is approximately  square feet and the maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 

table of contents we believe that the aforementioned properties are currently in good condition and properly maintained 
real estate through our subsidiary bayswater development corporation and its various subsidiaries bayswater  we are engaged in the acquisition  development  management  and disposition of land and improved properties 
the primary focus of our real estate operations has been the development of residential condominium projects along the east coast of central florida 
over the past several years we have developed five condominium projects 
our current project  pineapple house  is an eight story building containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units located in melbourne  florida  and is the first phase of a planned multi phase development 
this first phase was completed on budget and in a timely manner and we believe the project is attractive and of high quality 
our customers generally are pre retirement  retirement or second homebuyers seeking higher quality  maintenance free residences with generous amenities 
we acquire land for development only after feasibility and environmental testing has been performed 
generally  architectural and engineering plans for the projects are outsourced and the project plans are submitted to third party general building contractors for competitive fixed price bids to construct the improvements 
the sales process is conducted by outside real estate brokerages that best serve the specific markets where our projects are located 
in an effort to limit risk  our policy is to obtain a substantial number of contracts for sale  backed by customers non refundable earnest money deposits  prior to commencing construction on the condominium projects 
generally the minimum non refundable earnest money deposit is of the purchase price and is held in escrow by a third party until such time as the unit is closed and title to the unit has been transferred to the buyer 
we do not offer financing arrangements to purchasers of our condominiums 
we generally purchase land and pay for architectural  engineering and various other costs with cash reserves 
construction costs are generally financed with bank financing  as specified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of both december  and  we had no projects under construction and no backlog outstanding real estate contracts for sale excluding partial revenue already recognized on said contracts under the percentage of completion method in the real estate segment 
however  we own vacant property on which we plan to build two condominium buildings  which will comprise phase ii and phase iii of the pineapple house project 
although we have delayed the sales and construction of new projects  we believe the real estate market in our area will ultimately improve and we will resume our plans for this vacant property 
however  we can provide no assurance about the real estate market or our future plans 
our historical financial performance in real estate construction is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in particular  we expect financial results to vary from project to project and from quarter to quarter 
our revenue may therefore fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  and we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with numerous national and local real estate developers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors  including quality  location  design  perceived value  price and reputation in the marketplace 
we believe that we have certain competitive advantages including desirable locations  attractive designs and higher quality features not generally offered by other developers in the market in which we compete 
we are subject to federal  state and local statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations regarding  among other things  zoning  building permits  environmental standards  building moratoriums and building codes 
permits and approvals mandated by regulation for development of any magnitude are often numerous  significantly time consuming and onerous to obtain  and not guaranteed 
we believe that our real estate operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations 
the real estate division administrative offices are located within the corporate offices located in melbourne  florida 
discontinued operations through certain of our subsidiaries and predecessor companies  we were previously engaged in mining activities  and all such activities were discontinued or disposed of prior to in september  we were notified by the united states environmental protection agency the epa that we are a potentially responsible party prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at the anderson calhoun mine mill site the site in stevens county  washington which was previously owned by us see item  legal proceedings 
in november  we learned that in october  the state of washington  as part of its effort to catalog abandoned mines  issued a report on the sierra zinc mine mill site the sierra site  also in stevens county  washington  which we may have owned or operated  and which we may have used to process a limited amount of ore from the site 
the report did not address any potential required remediation or reclamation 
the sierra site is currently listed on epa s comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability information system database cerclis 
although we are not aware of any threatened governmental or other action with respect to the sierra site  there can be no assurance that such action will not occur in the future 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
our business involves various risks associated with the operations of our company 
to provide a framework to understand our operating environment  we are providing a brief explanation of the significant risks associated with our business 
although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors  others could emerge in the future 
each of the following risks could affect our performance 
risks related to our electrical construction operations we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small group of customers 
the loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our revenue and results of operations 
our electrical construction customer base is highly concentrated 
for example  in the year ended december   our top three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements herein 
our revenue could materially decline if we lose one or more of our significant customers 
in addition  revenue under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing and volume of work which such customers order in a given period and a result of competition from the in house service organizations of our customers 
reduced demand for our services or the loss of one or more of these customers would  if not replaced by other business  result in a decrease in revenue  margins  profits and cash receipts  which could be material 
the electrical construction industry is highly competitive 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may  therefore  be able to provide their services at lower rates than we can provide 
many of our current and potential competitors  especially our competitors with national scope  also may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
if we fail to compete favorably with new or existing competitors  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our business is affected by the spending patterns of our customers and adverse weather conditions  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
our revenues are primarily driven by the spending patterns of our customers  which can vary significantly from period to period  as well as seasonal variations 
these variations are influenced by weather  hours of daylight  available system outages from utilities  bidding seasons and holidays and can have a significant impact on our gross margins 
most of our work is performed outdoors and as a result  our results of operations can be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
any weather related delays in the completion of  or which increase the cost of  our projects could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations in any one or more of our reporting periods 
an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could reduce the demand for our services 
because a substantial portion of our electrical construction work is performed for customers in the electric utility industry  an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could impair the financial condition of many of our customers  which could cause them to reduce their capital expenditures and demand for our services  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
skilled labor shortages and increased labor costs could negatively affect our ability to compete for new projects 
in our electrical construction business  we have from time to time experienced shortages of certain types of qualified personnel 
for example  currently there is a shortage of linemen capable of working on and supervising the construction of high voltage electric lines and substations 
linemen are frequently recruited across geographic regions to satisfy demand  including for storm restoration work  which can exacerbate this shortage 
the commencement of new  large scale infrastructure projects  increased demand for infrastructure improvements and the aging utility workforce further deplete the pool of skilled labor available to us  even if we are not awarded such projects 
as a result of these factors  the supply of experienced linemen and supervisors may not be sufficient to meet our expected demand and we may not be able to allocate or hire sufficient project managers for new electrical construction projects 
we may also spend considerable resources training employees who may then be hired by our competitors  forcing us to spend additional funds to attract personnel to fill those positions 
if we were unable to retain sufficient qualified personnel at a reasonable cost  or at all  we would be unable to staff new and existing projects  which would reduce our revenue 

table of contents our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in critical accounting estimates and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein  a significant portion of our revenue in our electrical construction operations is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting  using the cost to cost method  which is standard for fixed price contracts 
the percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenue and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenue  costs and profitability 
the cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profit for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in revenue or translate into profits 
backlog for our electrical construction operations at december  was million  which represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
this revenue is not guaranteed  however  as many of our customers may cancel their contracts with us on short notice typically days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
in addition  million of these uncompleted contracts are service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
typically  these service agreements do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice 
for these service agreements  we project the backlog amount based on our historical work from each customer 
to the extent that our customers cancel their contracts with us or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason  we will not realize revenue or profit from the associated backlog 
furthermore  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
as a result  even if we realize all the revenue from the projects in our backlog  if our expenses associated with these projects are higher than expected  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our projects are subject to numerous hazards 
if we do not maintain an adequate safety record  we may be ineligible to bid on certain projects  could be terminated from existing projects and could have difficulty procuring adequate insurance 
hazards experienced as a result of our electric construction operations include electrocutions  fires  mechanical failure and transportation accidents 
these hazards can cause and have caused personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages  including blackouts  and may result in suspension of our operations on a project  large damage claims  and  in extreme cases  criminal liability 
at any given time  we are subject to workers compensation claims and claims by employees  customers and third parties for property damage  loss of life and personal injuries resulting from such hazards or other workplace accidents 
further  regulatory changes implemented by the occupational safety and health administration could impose additional costs on us 
notwithstanding our investment of substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and we may be unable to avoid accidents resulting from the hazards described above and the associated liability exposure  which may be significant 
furthermore  if serious accidents or fatalities were to occur or if our safety record were to deteriorate  we could become ineligible to bid on certain projects and could be terminated from existing projects  our reputation and our prospects for future projects could be negatively affected  and we could be required to expend additional resources on health and safety programs 
in addition  if our safety record were to significantly deteriorate  it would become more difficult and expensive for us to procure adequate insurance 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
in certain circumstances  we are required to provide performance bonds to secure our contractual commitments 
although to date we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining bonding  if we were unable to obtain surety bonds in the future  or were required to post collateral in order to obtain surety bonds  our ability to obtain new contracts would be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
certain provisions of president obama s economic stimulus plan relating to construction of new electric transmission lines may fail to result in increased demand for our services 
the credit crisis and economic downturn has resulted in a tremendous amount of uncertainty with respect to our customers spending plans  and has resulted in certain projects being delayed or cancelled 
while we believe that president obama s economic stimulus plan  which was enacted in february  currently provides for federal government funding for the construction of approximately  miles of new transmission lines in the united states and should aid the wind  electrical 
table of contents transmission and rural broadband businesses  the extent to which it will is uncertain 
we cannot be certain how any such government funds would be used  if at all  in the regions in which we do business or what the impact that the use of any such funds would be on our financial results 
risks related to our real estate development operations we engage in real estate activities which are speculative and involve a high degree of risk the real estate industry is highly cyclical by nature and future market conditions are uncertain 
factors which adversely affect the real estate and homebuilding industries  many of which are beyond our control  include the availability and cost of financing  unfavorable interest rates and increases in inflation  overbuilding or decreases in demand  changes in national  regional and local economic conditions  cost overruns  inclement weather  and labor and material shortages  the impact of present or future environmental legislation  zoning laws and other regulations  availability  delays and costs associated with obtaining permits  approvals or licenses necessary to develop property  and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees 
the homebuilding and condominium industry is in the midst of a severe downturn that may continue for an indefinite period and continue to adversely affect our business 
a continuing decline in the demand for condominiums coupled with an increase in the inventory of available condominiums and other homes could adversely affect our sales volume and pricing even more than has occurred to date and  as a result  could reduce our earnings 
the homebuilding industry is in the midst of a severe downturn and the housing market in our area continues to be characterized by an oversupply of both new and resale home inventory  including foreclosed homes  reduced levels of consumer demand for new homes  aggressive price competition among homebuilders and increased incentives for home sales 
as a result  we  like many other builders  have experienced a decline in demand for new condominiums 
these challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and  in the near term  these conditions may further deteriorate 
we expect the continued weakness in the housing market will adversely affect this business segment as compared to prior periods and could result in additional inventory impairments in the future 
homebuilders inventories of unsold new homes of all types have increased as a result of increased cancellation rates on pending contracts as new homebuyers sometimes find it more advantageous to forfeit a deposit than to complete the purchase of the home 
in addition  an oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  has depressed prices and reduced margins 
this combination of lower demand and higher inventories affects both the number of condominiums that we can sell and the prices at which we can sell them 
we have no basis for predicting how long supply and demand will remain out of balance in the market where we operate or whether  even if demand and supply come back in balance  sales volumes or pricing will return to prior levels 
changes in national and regional economic conditions  as well as local economic conditions where we conduct our real estate development operations and where prospective purchasers of our condominiums live  can have a negative impact on our business 
adverse changes in employment levels  job growth  consumer confidence  interest rates and population growth may reduce demand and depress prices for our condominiums 
this  in turn  can reduce our earnings 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing for homebuyers  interest rates  consumer confidence  levels of new and existing homes for sale  demographic trends and housing demand 
if adverse conditions affect any of our markets  they could have a proportionately greater impact on us versus other homebuilding companies 
an excess supply of housing  including homes held for sale by investors and speculators  can also lower new home prices and reduce our gross margins on new home sales 
as a result of the foregoing  potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our condominiums  or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them 
we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because of market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts 
we may be unable to change the affordability of our homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways 
in addition  cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers sentiment changes and they may fail to honor their contracts  as occurred in 
table of contents the multifamily housing industry is highly competitive and  if others are more successful  our business could decline 
we operate in a very competitive environment  which is characterized by competition from a number of other real estate developers 
we compete with large national and regional development companies and with smaller local firms for land  financing  raw materials and skilled management and labor resources 
we also compete with the resale  or previously owned  condominium market 
increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives and or reduce our prices 
increased competition could also result in an oversupply of condominiums or other housing alternatives available for sale  which could depress the prices at which we can sell our condominiums  and increase the length of time it takes us to sell them 
if a failure to compete effectively resulted in our selling fewer condominiums at lower prices  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if we do not receive cash corresponding to previously recognized revenue  our future cash flows could be lower than expected 
over the last few years  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we recognize revenue and profits from sales of condominium units during the course of construction 
revenue recognition commences and continues to be recorded when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a full refund of its deposit except for non delivery of the residence  a substantial percentage of units are under non cancelable contracts  collection of the sales price is reasonably assured and costs can be reasonably estimated 
due to various contingencies  like delayed construction and buyer defaults  as occurred in  we may receive less cash than the amount of revenue already recognized or the cash may be received at a later date than we expected  which could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if land is not available at reasonable prices  our sales and earnings could decrease 
our real estate development operations depend on our ability to obtain land at reasonable prices for the development of our residential condominiums 
changes in the general availability of land  competition for available land  availability of financing to acquire land  zoning regulations that limit housing density and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land for new residential developments 
if the supply of land appropriate for development of our residential condominiums becomes more limited because of these factors  or for any other reason  the cost of land could increase  which could reduce the profitability of our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our condominiums  and the number of condominiums that we build and sell could be reduced  which would reduce our revenue 
if the market value of our land and developments drops significantly  our profits could decrease 
the market value of our land and condominium inventories of our real estate development operations depends on market conditions 
we acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current market 
if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory  we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past  may experience less than anticipated profits and may not be able to recover our costs when we sell our property or finished product 
in the face of adverse market conditions  we may have substantial inventory carrying costs or may have to sell land or completed units at a loss  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  if there is a decrease in demand for condominiums such that the market value of a condominium is less than purchase price reduced by the deposit made by a buyer  the buyer may elect to forfeit their deposit to us and have no further obligation to purchase the condominium  resulting in a loss of revenue  operating income and a possible write down of condominiums in inventory 
in  as the market deteriorated  we had thirteen buyers default on their contracts and forfeit their deposits 
as the market continued to stagnate  we determined it was necessary to reduce our selling prices for the remaining units and  as a result  recorded a write down of  related to condominium units held for sale 
in  as the market remained challenging  we reduced the selling prices of our remaining oak park condominium units and recorded a write down of  the weakness in the market accelerated during the fourth quarter of and has continued into  including increased foreclosures  lack of consumer confidence  significant disruptions in the broader financial markets and severe strains in the credit markets 
based on the current market conditions we recorded an additional write down of million in december on the remaining pineapple house condominium units held for sale 
continued market weakness could lead to additional write downs on the pineapple house condominium units held for sale 
government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our developments  increase our expenses or limit our building activities  which could have a negative impact on our operations 
we must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities in connection with our real estate development operations  and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority 
we incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 
any increase in legal and regulatory 
table of contents requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs  as discussed below 
various local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning building  zoning  sales and similar matters apply to and or affect the residential multifamily industry 
municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities  such as water and sewer taps 
in some areas  municipalities may enact growth control initiatives  which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year 
this governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities  mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers 
the industry also has experienced an increase in state and local legislation and regulations which limit the availability or use of land 
we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law 
further  we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed developments  whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties 
increases in taxes or government fees could increase our costs  and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for our condominiums 
increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space  road improvements  or to provide low and moderate income housing  could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our condominiums 
in addition  increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential customers who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide  as a result  not to purchase one of our condominiums 
in addition  any changes in the income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing  which in turn could reduce our sales and adversely affect our revenues 
our business is concentrated in florida  which increases our exposure to local adverse events 
in our real estate development operations  we currently develop and sell condominiums only on the east coast of florida 
as a consequence  our exposure to local adverse events  such as natural disasters or changes in economic conditions  is increased 
in particular  florida is affected by tropical storms and hurricanes  which can damage or destroy buildings  including condominiums 
the occurrence of such a storm or other natural disaster could result in delays in construction and shortages and increased costs of labor and building materials 
any such delays or additional costs could adversely affect the profitability of our real estate development operations 
additionally  a number of insurance carriers have opted either not to write insurance in florida at all or to only renew existing policies and not to write new policies 
these practices have resulted in substantial increases in the cost of insurance  a widespread shortage of available private insurance for property owners in florida and the creation of a state joint underwriting association 
the state provided insurance coverages generally afford less protection at greater costs than is typically provided by private insurance carriers 
the inability of property owners to obtain cost effective insurance could have an adverse effect on demand for property in our markets  which could reduce our revenue 
furthermore  there are periods of time during which insurance companies will not write policies because of the presence of a named storm that may pass over the areas in which we sell condominiums 
during these periods  home closings in areas that could be affected by such a storm will be delayed until the risk of the storm has passed and the required insurance can be obtained 
adverse weather conditions and conditions in nature beyond our control could significantly impact our quarterly revenue and profitability 
in our real estate development operations  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  such as  but not limited to  hurricanes  tornadoes  floods and fires  can have serious effects on our ability to perform work 
we also may be affected by unforeseen engineering  environmental or geological problems 
any of these adverse events or circumstances could cause delays in the completion of  or increase the cost of  our projects and  as a result  could adversely affect our sales  earnings and profitability 
in addition  approaching storms require that sales  development and construction operations be suspended in favor of storm preparation activities such as securing construction materials and equipment 
after a storm has passed  construction related resources such as sub contracted labor and building materials are likely to be redeployed to hurricane recovery efforts around the state of florida 
governmental permitting and inspection activities may similarly be focused primarily on returning displaced residents to homes damaged by the storms  rather than on new construction activity 
depending on the severity of the damage caused by the storms  disruptions such as these could last for several months 

table of contents if we experience shortages of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control  there could be delays or increased costs in developing our condominiums  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to develop residential condominiums may be affected by circumstances beyond our control  including work stoppages  labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people  such as carpenters  roofers  electricians and plumbers  lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services  our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured  and shortages  or delays in availability  or fluctuations in prices of  building materials 
any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our condominium projects 
if we are not able to recover these increased costs by raising the prices of our condominiums we might decide to postpone or cancel the development of condominium projects on which we have not yet begun construction 
if that happens  our operating results could be harmed 
additionally  we may be limited in the amount we can raise sales prices by our customers unwillingness to pay higher prices 
product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly  which could adversely affect our business 
as a real estate developer  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims  which can include bodily injury claims and mold related property damage claims among others  are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
in addition  the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high  and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited 
there can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims  we may experience losses that could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition  which could be material 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing for the development of our projects 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our costs would increase and our revenue would decrease  or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels 
increases in interest rates can make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business  which would have an adverse affect on our profitability 
if our potential customers are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations also depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our condominiums 
during  the mortgage lending industry began experiencing significant instability 
as a result of increased default rates  particularly but not entirely with regard to sub prime and other non conforming loans  many lenders have reduced their willingness to make and tightened their credit requirements with regard to  residential mortgage loans 
fewer loan products and stricter loan qualification standards may make it more difficult for some borrowers to finance the purchase of our condominiums 
increases in the cost of home mortgage financing could prevent our potential customers from purchasing our condominiums 
in addition  where our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a condominium from us  increases in mortgage costs could prevent the buyers of our customers existing homes from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete the purchase  which could result in our potential customers inability to buy a condominium from us 
if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing  our sales and revenue could decline 
we depend upon the availability and skill of general contractors and subcontractors 
substantially all our construction work is done by subcontractors working for a general contractor we select for a particular project 
accordingly  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of those subcontractors 
we do not have long term contractual commitments with any particular general contractor  subcontractors or suppliers 
although we believe that our relationships with our general contractors  subcontractors and suppliers are good  we cannot assure you that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available to us at reasonable rates 
the inability to contract with skilled subcontractors or general contractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could limit our ability to build and deliver condominiums and could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our real estate development operations 
additionally  if there is an impairment  bankruptcy or default by the general contractor or subcontractors our production  revenue and operating income may be adversely affected 
we rely on outside professionals whose errors could increase our costs 
we often collaborate with numerous professionals such as architects  engineers and general contractors in the development of our real estate projects 
in the course of our business  we rely on the work of these professionals to help design and build the condominiums that we develop  and errors in their work can create significant increases in cost and delays in construction 

table of contents our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
our revenue and operating results from real estate development operations are subject to fluctuations 
because we typically have only one or two projects under development at any time  factors such as the timing of the start of construction of new projects  the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction and others can cause our revenue and operating results to vary from period to period and from year to year 
accordingly  the historical financial performance of our real estate development operations is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results for any particular period  and quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
we may be subject to environmental liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our properties 
the development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on our part as owner and developer  for our own acts as well as the acts of prior owners  current owners or past owners of adjacent parcels 
if hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of our properties  we may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to those hazardous substances 
should a substantial environmental hazard be found on any of our properties  our results of operations and the value of the contaminated property could be adversely affected 
increased insurance risk could negatively affect our business 
insurance and surety companies may take actions that could negatively affect our business  including increasing insurance premiums  requiring higher self insured retentions and deductibles  requiring additional collateral or covenants on surety bonds  reducing limits  restricting coverages  imposing exclusions  and refusing to underwrite certain risks and classes of business 
any of these actions may adversely affect our ability to obtain appropriate insurance coverage at reasonable costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our business our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by the timing and volume of work under contract  changes in national  regional  local and general economic conditions  the budgetary spending patterns of customers  variations in margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  a change in the demand for our services  increased costs of performance of our services caused by severe weather conditions  increases in design and construction costs that we are unable to pass through to our customers  the termination of existing agreements  losses experienced in our operations that are not covered by insurance  a change in the mix of our customers  contracts and business  availability of qualified labor hired for specific projects  and changes in bonding requirements applicable to existing and new agreements 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of key management personnel 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the efforts of our executive officers and senior management  including those of our subsidiaries 
other than with respect to our chief executive officer  we do not have employment or non competition agreements with any of our employees 
we believe that key members of our senior management possess valuable industry knowledge  relationships and experience that are important to the successful operation of our business 
the relationships between our executive officers and senior management and our customers are important to our being retained 
we are also dependent upon our project managers and field supervisors who are responsible for managing and drawing employees to our projects 
there can be no assurance that any individual will continue in his or her capacity for any particular period of time 
industry wide competition for managerial talent in electrical construction has increased and the loss of one or more of our key employees  could negatively impact our ability to manage our business and relationships with our customers 
the loss of any of our executive officers or senior management could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents acts of war or terrorism may seriously harm our business 
acts of war  any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power  including the armed conflict in the middle east  or acts of terrorism  may cause disruption to the economy  our company  our employees and our customers  which could adversely impact our total revenue and earnings 
we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have determined that we are in a cumulative loss position based on the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
due to this cumulative loss position and the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
although we do expect to recover from the current economic downturn to normal profit levels in the future  it may be necessary for us to record additional valuation allowances in the future related to operating losses 
valuation allowances could materially increase our income tax expense or reduce our income tax benefit  and therefore adversely affect our results of operations and tangible net worth in the period in which such valuation allowance is recorded 
we could be adversely affected by liabilities associated with our former mining business 
through certain of our subsidiaries and predecessor companies  we were previously engaged in mining activities  and all such activities were discontinued or disposed of prior to however  we could still be liable for previous activities at sites we once owned 
we have been identified as a prp for investigation and removal activities at one such site  as discussed in item herein

item legal proceedings 
environmental on september   the epa issued a special notice letter notifying us that we are a prp  along with three other parties  with respect to investigation and removal activities at the anderson calhoun mine mill site the site in stevens county  washington 
we sold the site property in we have investigated the historic operations that occurred at the site as well as the nature and scope of environmental conditions at the site that may present concerns to the epa 
based upon our investigation to date  we have determined that our operations at the site were primarily exploratory and that we never engaged in any milling or other processing activities at the site 
our records reflect that between the years and we extracted a limited amount  tons of surface ore from the site for off site processing 
the site has changed owners several times since we sold it  and we believe that a substantial majority of the mining activities and all of the milling and related processing and process waste disposal activities likely were conducted by subsequent owners 
in april  the epa approved as final an engineering evaluation cost analysis report ee ca report for the site 
the ee ca report proposes to adopt as the preferred remedy a removal action primarily focused on addressing ore processing areas and wastes that were created after the company sold the site 
on or about october   epa issued an action memorandum that specifies the nature and scope of the response action that the agency will require with respect to the site 
the action memorandum adopted the preferred removal action from the ee ca report 
the ee ca report  following cost estimation procedures applicable to ee ca documents  estimates that the net present value of the proposed removal action is million 
this figure includes amounts for contingencies and is based on currently available information  certain assumptions and estimates 
in light of our limited role in the creation of the wastes that are the primary focus of the removal action  we believe that the other prp s  particularly blue tee corporation 
table of contents successor to american zinc  will be liable for most of the cleanup costs  as they were directly responsible for all on site ore processing activities and wastes 
however  there can be no assurance as to the scope of our share of liability for cleanup costs 
on or about september   epa issued a letter demanding payment of certain costs previously incurred by epa and including a settlement proposal whereby we and combustion engineering  inc would settle with epa through a cash payment and epa would look solely to blue tee corporation to implement the removal action set forth in the ee ca report 
a revised settlement proposal with substantially similar terms was issued by the epa on february  we understand that other prps received similar letters  including combustion engineering  inc  blue tee corporation and washington resources  inc the current owner of the mineral estate at the site 
the terms of any settlement with epa and other prps are currently under negotiation 
our portion of a settlement with the epa would not be expected to have any material adverse effect on our financial position 
epa s settlement offer is based  in part  on the agency s acceptance of our representations to the effect that we are a minimal contributor to the hazardous substances that are the subject of the environmental investigation and removal action 
we anticipate that the settlement process will be concluded during the second quarter of notwithstanding a settlement with epa  the party that implements the removal action at the site may  in theory  seek cost recovery from other prps at the site 
we believe  however  under the facts of this matter  that any such contribution claim against us would be resolved favorably in light of our previous contributions to the response action and our minimal role in the generation of the hazardous substances that are the subject of the response action at the site 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  any of the prps may be jointly and severally liable to the epa for the full amount of any response costs incurred by the epa  including costs related to investigation and remediation  subject to a right of contribution from other prps 
in practice  prps generally agree to perform such response activities  and negotiate among themselves to determine their respective contributions to any such multi party activities based upon equitable allocation factors that focus primarily on their respective contributions to the contamination at issue

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction through our subsidiary southeast power corporation  we are engaged in the construction and maintenance of electric utility facilities for electric utilities and industrial customers  and the installation of fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
southeast power  based in titusville  florida  performs electrical contracting services in the southeastern  mid atlantic and western regions of the united states 
we are also involved through our subsidiary bayswater development corporation and its various subsidiaries in the acquisition  development  management and disposition of land and improved properties 
the primary focus of our real estate operations has been the development of residential condominium projects along the east coast of central florida 
over the past several years we have developed five condominium projects 
our current project  pineapple house  is an eight story building containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units located in melbourne  florida  and is the first phase of a planned multi phase development 
overview our revenue from electrical construction operations increased for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in demand for our electrical construction services  particularly our fiber optic work  as well as an increase in the number of projects in process in the fourth quarter of during the first three quarters of  we experienced a slow down in demand for our services and found it necessary to place additional work crews on several existing jobs in an effort to avoid a reduction in our electrical construction work force 
historically  we have found that moving work crews in the middle of a job and adding additional crews to a job does not improve the productivity on that job and this had an adverse effect on our productivity in the second and third quarters of in early june  we reduced our electrical construction work force by approximately 
on june   we announced that we had been awarded new electrical construction contracts aggregating million 
in july and august  we rehired the majority of those previously laid off employees to meet the anticipated demands of the new contracts we had been awarded 
although work remained slow throughout the summer and into the fall  we experienced a significant improvement in the fourth quarter and are encouraged by the growth in new business and our expansion into colorado  northern texas and missouri 
operating margins of our electrical construction operations increased to for the year ended december  from for the like period in  primarily the result of increased productivity in the fourth quarter of revenue from our real estate development operations increased for the year ended december   when compared to this increase was mainly due to the reversal of previously recognized revenue on the pineapple house project upon the notification from buyers of their intent to default on their purchase contracts in  which offset a significant portion of our revenue from sales of condominium units in real estate development operations had an operating loss of million in the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million in the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increased loss is primarily the result of the write down of  on the oak park condominium units all of which have been sold as of december  and million on the remaining pineapple house condominium units  during the year ended december  as of december   we held fourteen pineapple house condominium units for sale 
the housing market has continued to deteriorate as consumer confidence declined and the domestic economy experienced the most significant downturn in recent history 
general economic pressures continue to drive down the volume and prices of homes and condominiums being sold  as rising levels of foreclosures add inventory to an already saturated market 
in addition  the credit markets and mortgage industry have experienced a period of unparalleled instability and disruption 
overall consumer confidence has continued to weaken  resulting in fewer potential home purchasers willing to enter the market 
as a result of these and other factors  we recently determined that we will postpone commencement of the next phase of the pineapple house project until market conditions improve 
looking forward with respect to our real estate development operations  we are unable to predict when these deteriorating market conditions will subside and further deterioration in market conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on the sales and pricing of our condominium units  the commencement and development of new projects and on the results of our real estate development operations 
however  we have completed the first phase of the pineapple house project on budget and in a timely manner  and we believe the project is attractive and of high quality 
furthermore  we are no longer incurring construction costs with respect to this phase and our share of the maintenance costs on the unsold units is expected to be no more than  annually 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  
table of contents revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fixed price electrical construction contracts  real estate development projects  deferred income tax assets and environmental remediation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management has discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies  estimates and related disclosure with the audit committee of the board of directors 
percentage of completion electrical construction segment we recognize revenue from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using primarily the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  changes in productivity and scheduling  and the cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  site conditions and scheduling that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  client needs  client delays in providing approvals  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  a change in the availability and proximity of materials and governmental regulation  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of income and revenue recognition 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
due to our experience and our detailed approach in determining our cost estimates for all of our significant projects  we believe our estimates to be highly reliable 
however  our projects can be complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a number of projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
if a current estimate of total costs indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
accrued contract losses as of december  and were  and  respectively 
revenue from change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is probable 
percentage of completion real estate development segment for  all revenue associated with real estate development projects that met the criteria specified by sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  was recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue is recognized when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  a substantial percentage at least one third of the condominiums are under firm  non refundable contracts  except in the case of non delivery of the unit or interest  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  after considering the requirements of applicable state laws  the condominium contract  and the terms of applicable financing agreements  collection of the sales price is reasonably assured  deposits equal or exceed of the contract price  and sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
we determine that construction is beyond a preliminary stage when engineering and design work  execution of construction contracts  site clearance and preparation  excavation and the building foundation are complete 
in november  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 applicability of a buyer s continuing investment under fasb statement no 
for sales of condominiums 
eitf no 
requires condominium sales to meet the continuing involvement criterion of sfas no 
in order for profit to be recognized under the percentage of completion method 
eitf no 
became effective for our fiscal year beginning january  this consensus could require that additional deposits be collected by developers of condominium projects that wish to recognize profit during the construction period under the percentage of completion method 
the effect of this eitf no 
was not material to our consolidated financial statements  as there are no projects currently under construction 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of eitf no 
on future projects  we will be required to delay revenue recognition until the aggregate investment tests described in sfas no 
and eitf no 
have been met 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that a material difference in total actual project costs versus total estimated project costs is unlikely due to the nature of the fixed price contracts we enter into with the general contractors on our real estate projects 
if a current estimate of total project costs indicates a loss on a project  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
there were no accrued contract losses as of december  or in the real estate development segment 
the timing of revenue and expense recognition is contingent on construction productivity 
factors possibly impeding construction productivity include  but are not limited to  supply of labor  materials and equipment  scheduling  weather  permitting and unforeseen events 
when a buyer defaults on the contract for sale  revenue and expenses recognized in prior periods are adjusted in the period of default 
in the year ended december   as a result of thirteen buyers defaulting on their purchase contracts  we recorded a reversal in revenue previously recognized of million and in costs of sales previously recorded of million 

table of contents real estate inventory valuation real estate inventory  which consists of completed condominium units  is carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell 
in accordance with sfas no 
 real estate inventory is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount or basis is not expected to be recovered  impairment losses are recorded and the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 
in estimating the cash flows for completed condominium units  we use various estimates such as a expected sales pace to absorb the number of units based upon economic conditions that may have either a short term or long term impact on the market in which the units are located  competition within our market  historical sales rates of the units within the project  and b expected net sales prices in the near term based upon current pricing estimates  as well as estimated changes in future sales prices based upon historical sales prices of the units within the project or historical sales prices of similar product offerings in our market 
our determination of fair value requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with selling the assets and related estimated cash flows 
in determining the fair value of the remaining units in our pineapple house project we used a discount rate of 
we estimate fair values of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated  which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change 
for example  further market deterioration or changes in our assumptions may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges on previously impaired inventory 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered or settled 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the previously recorded valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   our deferred tax assets were largely comprised of nol carryforwards  an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward and inventory adjustments on unsold condominium units refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the sfas no 
more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
based upon an evaluation of all available evidence  we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets totaling million during the fourth quarter of our cumulative loss position over the evaluation period and the current uncertain and volatile market conditions were significant negative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in future periods  the allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million as of december  compared to as of december  the minimum amount of future taxable income required to be generated to fully realize the deferred tax assets is approximately million 

table of contents provision for remediation in september  we were notified by the epa that we are a prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at a mine that we formerly owned 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this matter 
it is impossible at this stage to estimate the total costs of the remediation at the site or our share of liability for those costs due to various factors  including incomplete information regarding the site and the other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of actual remediation costs and our equitable share of liability for the contamination 
as of december   the cumulative net expense was  within discontinued operations  which represents the current estimate of our share of the costs associated with both an emergency removal action previously undertaken by the epa and actual remediation costs  the professional fees associated with the ee ca study and the anticipated professional fees estimated through the completed remediation  all reduced by both actual and estimated insurance recoveries 
total actual costs to be incurred at the site in future periods may vary from this estimate  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental costs 
as of december   we have recorded a reserve balance for future applicable costs of  accrued as a current liability within discontinued operations 
the accrual will be reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time  which could result in changes to its amount 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the table below is a reconciliation of our operating income loss attributable to each of our segments for the two year period ended december as indicated electrical construction revenue operating expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative depreciation provision for doubtful accounts loss on sale of assets total operating expenses operating income real estate development revenue operating expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative depreciation write down of inventory total operating expenses operating loss operating income loss is total operating revenue less operating expenses inclusive of depreciation and selling  general and administrative expenses for each segment

liquidity and capital resources working capital analysis our primary cash needs have been for capital expenditures and working capital

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
in addition  we had million in an unused revolving line of credit as of december   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that this cash on hand  our credit facilities and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our future operating needs and debt requirements 
our line of credit is provided by one regional bank and based on our conversations with representatives of the bank  we believe we will have access to the full amount of our credit facility during  if necessary 
cash flow analysis the following table presents our net cash flows for each of the years ended december as indicated net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows from operating activities are comprised of loss from continuing operations  adjusted to reflect the timing of cash receipts and disbursements therefrom 
cash provided by our operating activities totaled million in the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million from operating activities for our cash flows are influenced by the level of operations  operating margins  the types of services we provide  as well as the stages of our projects in both the electrical construction and real estate segments 
net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  is primarily due to the decrease in cash used within the real estate segment in the current year  as pineapple house is completed and no new project has been started 
operating cash flows normally fluctuate relative to the status of development of projects within both the real estate and electrical construction segments 
days of sales outstanding analysis we evaluate fluctuations in our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for the electrical construction segment by comparing days of sales outstanding dso 
we calculate dso as of the end of any period by utilizing the preceding three months of electrical construction revenue to determine sales per day 
we then divide accounts receivable and accrued billings  net of allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of the period by sales per day to calculate dso for accounts receivable 
to calculate dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  we divide costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts by sales per day 
for the years ended december  and  our dso for accounts receivable were and  respectively  and our dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts were and  respectively 
as of february   we have received of our december  outstanding trade accounts receivable balance and billed of the retainage 
as of february   we have invoiced our customers for of the balance in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings as of december  investing activities cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was  compared to cash used of million during our investing activities for the years ended december  and  consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million and million  respectively  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and 
table of contents equipment of  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures are mainly attributed to purchases of equipment  primarily trucks and heavy machinery used by our electrical construction segment for the upgrading and replacement of equipment 
our capital budget for is expected to total approximately million  the majority of which is for the replacement of aging equipment in the electrical construction segment 
these purchases will be funded through our working capital  leases and lines of credit 
financing activities cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  compared to cash used in financing activities of million during our financing activities for the current year consisted of repayments on notes payable of million for the pineapple house mortgage and million on the equipment loan  as well as repayments on capital leases of  these were partially offset by borrowings made within the real estate segment of  to pay final billings for the pineapple house project and finance interest accrued on the balance of the pineapple house mortgage 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of repayments on notes payable of million for the pineapple house mortgage and repayments of million on the two equipment loans in the electrical construction segment 
in addition  we made payments of  towards our capital lease obligations during these payments were partially offset by million in borrowings within the real estate segment  used for completion of phase i of the pineapple house project and borrowings of million in the electrical construction segment  used to purchase equipment 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our million equipment loan and million under our million pineapple house mortgage 
on march   we agreed to reduce the maximum principal amount of the pineapple house mortgage to million from million to reduce our fees and stand by costs  since the company does not plan on proceeding with the next phase of pineapple house in the near future 
accordingly  if the company determines to proceed with the next phase pineapple house in the future we will likely need to obtain additional financing 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these borrowings 
we have paid no cash dividends on our common stock since  and it is not expected that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future 
forecast we anticipate our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and credit facilities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  our revenue  results of operations and cash flows  as well as our ability to seek additional financing may be negatively impacted by factors including  but not limited to  a decline in demand for electrical construction services and or condominiums in the markets served and general economic conditions  heightened competition  availability of construction materials  increased interest rates and adverse weather conditions 
inflation as a result of relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results
