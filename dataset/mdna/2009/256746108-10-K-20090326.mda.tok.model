item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in management s discussion and analysis  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company  including what factors affect our business  what our net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were in  and  why those net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were different from the year before  how all of this affects our overall financial condition  what our expenditures for capital projects were in and and what we expect them to be in  and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our 
consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   february  and february  in management s discussion and analysis  we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year compared to the comparable fiscal year and the fiscal year compared to the comparable fiscal year key events and recent developments several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations 
you should keep in mind that on february   we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility will be based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
our march  million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 
on march   we reorganized by creating a new holding company structure 
the new parent company is dollar tree  inc  replacing dollar tree stores  inc  which is now an operating subsidiary 
on march   we entered into two million interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our million variable rate term loan 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock 
this authorization was in addition to the november authorization which had approximately million remaining 
at january   we had approximately million remaining under board authorizations 
overview our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise 
two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends 
first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions 
second  sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next 
we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales  because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared 
we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales  which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales 
the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 
at january   we operated  stores in states  with million selling square feet compared to  stores with million selling square feet at february  during fiscal  we opened stores  expanded stores and closed stores  compared to new stores opened  stores expanded and stores closed during fiscal in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 
of the million selling square foot increase in  million was added by expanding existing stores 
the average size of our stores opened in was approximately  selling square feet or about  gross square feet 
the average new store size decreased slightly in from approximately  selling square feet or about  gross square feet for new stores in for  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately   selling square feet or about   gross square feet 
we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 
we expect the majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores 
fiscal ended on february  and included weeks  commensurate with the retail calendar 
the rd week in added approximately million in sales 
fiscal and ended on january  and february   respectively  and both years included weeks 
in fiscal  comparable store net sales increased by 
the comparable store net sales increase was the result of increases of in the number of transactions and a increase in average transaction size 
we believe comparable store net sales continue to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives  including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the roll out of freezers and coolers to more of our stores 
at january  we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately  stores compared to approximately  stores at february  we believe that this enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers and increasing the average transaction size 
in addition  we now accept food stamps in approximately  qualified stores compared to  at the end of beginning october   all of our stores accept visa credit which has had a positive impact on our sales for fiscal with the pressures of the current economic environment  we have seen an increase in the demand for basic  consumable merchandise in as a result  we have shifted the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn 
this shift has negatively impacted our margins in  and we believe that this increase in basic  consumer product merchandise will negatively impact our margins in the first half of our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores 
we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last two years 
inventory turnover improved by approximately basis points in compared to and by approximately basis points in compared to fiscal was the fourth consecutive year of increased inventory turnover 
inventory per selling square foot also decreased at january  compared to february  on may   legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage from an hour to an hour by july as a result  our wages will increase in  however  we believe that we can partially offset the increase in payroll costs through increased store productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 
we must continue to control our merchandise costs  inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses 
increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 
on march   we completed our acquisition of deal stores  which included stores that offered an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than most of these stores continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts  including higher price points  without disrupting the single price point model in our dollar tree stores 
we have opened new deal stores  including some in new markets  and as of january   we have stores under the deal banner that are selling most items for or less but also sell items for more than  compared to stores at february  results of operations the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of net sales year ended year ended year ended january  february  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended february  net sales 
net sales increased  or million  in compared to  resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores and a increase in comparable store net sales 
comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores  which we include in the calculation  and  to a lesser extent  are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 
the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january  and february  january  february  new stores acquired leases expanded or relocated stores closed stores of the million selling square foot increase in approximately million was added by expanding existing stores 
gross profit 
gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to a basis point increase in merchandise cost  including inbound freight  resulting from an increase in the sales mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and higher diesel fuel costs compared with partially offsetting this increase was a basis point decrease in shrink expense due to favorable adjustments to shrink estimates based on actual inventory results during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for compared to for the decrease is primarily due to the following depreciation expense decreased basis points primarily due to the leveraging associated with the comparable store net sales increase for the year 
payroll related expenses decreased basis points primarily as a result of lower field payroll costs as a percentage of sales  due to the leveraging from the comparable store net sales increase in partially offsetting these decreases was an approximate basis point increase in store operating costs due to increases in repairs and maintenance and utility costs in the current year 
operating income 
due to the reasons discussed above  operating income margin was in compared to in income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in the lower rate in the current year reflects the recognition of certain tax benefits in accordance with financial accounting standards board s financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and a lower blended state tax rate resulting from the settlement of state tax audits in the current year which allowed us to release income tax reserves and accrue less interest expense on tax uncertainties in the current year 
these benefits to the tax rate were partially offset by a reduction in tax exempt interest income in the current year 
fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  net sales 
net sales increased  or million  in compared to  resulting primarily from sales in our new and expanded stores 
our sales increase was also impacted by a increase in comparable store net sales for this increase is based on the comparable weeks for both years 
these increases were partially offset by an extra week of sales in due to the week retail calendar for on a comparative week basis  sales increased approximately in compared to comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores  which we include in the calculation  and  to a lesser extent  are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 
the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february  and february  february  february  new stores deal acquisition acquired leases expanded or relocated stores closed stores of the million selling square foot increase in approximately million was added by expanding existing stores 
gross profit 
gross profit margin increased to in compared to in the increase was primarily due to a basis point decrease in merchandise cost  including inbound freight  due to improved initial mark up in many categories in this decrease was partially offset by a basis point increase in occupancy costs due to the loss of leverage from the extra week of sales in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for compared to for the increase is primarily due to the following operating and corporate expenses increased approximately basis points due to increased debit and credit fees resulting from increased debit transactions in and the rollout of visa credit at october  also  in  we had approximately basis points of income related to early lease terminations 
occupancy costs increased basis points primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance costs in partially offsetting these increases was an approximate basis point decrease in depreciation expense due to the expiration of the depreciable life on much of the supply chain hardware and software placed in service in operating income 
due to the reasons discussed above  operating income margin was in and income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in the rate for reflects a reduction of tax exempt interest income in the current year due to lower investment levels resulting from increased share repurchase activity and an increase in tax reserves in accordance with fin these increases more than offset a slight decrease in our net state tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our business requires capital to build and open new stores  expand our distribution network and operate existing stores 
our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october 
historically  we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
the following table compares cash related information for the years ended january   february   and february  year ended year ended year ended january  february  february  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared to last year due to increased earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization in the current year and lower prepaid rent amounts at the end of january february rent payments were made prior to the end of fiscal which resulted in a prepaid asset in fiscal whereas february rent was paid in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to due to increased working capital requirements in and increases in the provision for deferred taxes  partially offset by improved earnings before depreciation and amortization in net cash used in investing activities increased million in the current year 
net proceeds from the sale of short term investments were higher in the prior year in order to fund share repurchases 
overall  short term investment activity has decreased in the current year resulting from the liquidation of our short term investments early in the current year due to market conditions 
these amounts were primarily invested in cash equivalent money market accounts 
partially offsetting the decrease in net proceeds from the sales of short term investments was higher capital expenditures million higher in the prior year due to the expansions of the briar creek distribution center and corporate headquarters 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million in compared to this decrease is due to million of increased proceeds from short term investment activity in to fund increased share repurchases and million used in to acquire deal assets 
these were partially offset by increased capital expenditures in resulting from the briar creek distribution center and the corporate headquarters expansions 
in the current year  financing activities provided cash of million as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
in the prior year  net cash used in financing activities was million 
this was the result of share repurchases of million for fiscal  partially offset by stock option exercises resulting from the company s stock price last year being higher than it had been in the prior several years 
net cash used in financing activities increased million in due primarily to increased share repurchases in partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in resulting from the company s higher stock price earlier in the year 
at january   our long term borrowings were million and our capital lease commitments were million 
we also have million and million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements  under which approximately million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january  on february   we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the agreement is based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the line of credit  payable quarterly 
the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement 
the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
the agreement  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
our march  million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 
as of january   the million term loan is outstanding under the agreement 
in march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through march in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
this amount was in addition to the million remaining on the march authorization 
then  in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock 
this authorization was in addition to the november authorization which had approximately million remaining at the time 
we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal and approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal we had no share repurchases in fiscal at january   we have approximately million remaining under board authorization 
funding requirements overview we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal to total approximately million  which includes capital expenditures  initial inventory and pre opening costs 
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal are between and million  including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores and the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately stores 
we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 
the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january   including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  and our commitments  including interest on long term borrowings in millions contractual obligations total thereafter lease financing operating lease obligations capital lease obligations long term borrowings credit agreement revenue bond financing interest on long term borrowings total obligations commitments total expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in thereafter letters of credit and surety bonds freight contracts technology assets total commitments lease financing operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases 
the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january  for stores that were not yet open on january  capital lease obligations 
our capital lease obligations are primarily for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center 
credit agreement 
on february   we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility will be based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
this rate was at january  the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the line of credit  payable quarterly 
the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement 
the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
the agreement  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
as of january   we had million outstanding on the agreement 
our march  million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 
revenue bond financing 
in may  we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued million of variable rate demand revenue bonds 
we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition  construction and installation of land  buildings  machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch  mississippi 
at january   the balance outstanding on the bonds was million 
these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable 
the bonds contain a demand provision and  therefore  outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities 
we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate  which was at january  interest on long term borrowings 
this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at january  commitments letters of credit and surety bonds 
in march  we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement  which provides million for letters of credit 
in december  we entered into an additional letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement  which provides million for letters of credit 
letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january  we also have approximately million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our self insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 
freight contracts 
we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through february the total amount of these commitments is approximately million 
technology assets 
we have commitments totaling approximately million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during derivative financial instruments on march   we entered into two million interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our million variable rate term loan 
under these agreements  we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 
in exchange  the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate  which approximates the variable rate on the debt  excluding the credit spread 
these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these swaps expire in march we are party to one additional interest rate swap  which allows us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds 
the swap is based on a notional amount of million 
under the million agreement  as amended  we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate 
in exchange  the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate  which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds 
the variable interest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly 
no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the knock out rate 
the swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in because of the knock out provision in the million swap  changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates 
certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates 
following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 
inventory valuation as discussed in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments  including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could  under certain circumstances  result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  quantities of slow moving or seasonal  carryover merchandise on hand  historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside of our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual  historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted  if necessary  for current economic conditions 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year  therefore  the shrink accrual recorded at january  is based on estimated shrink for most of  including the fourth quarter 
we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years 
however  we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition 
we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 
accrued expenses on a monthly basis  we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses  self insurance programs  store level operating expenses  such as property taxes and utilities  and certain other expenses 
our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results 
our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary 
these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors 
certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them 
the related accruals are adjusted as management s estimates change 
differences in management s estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual 
our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low 
historically  the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates  including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing  applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
in addition  we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws  including relevant case law  and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and  if so  judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded 
we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate
