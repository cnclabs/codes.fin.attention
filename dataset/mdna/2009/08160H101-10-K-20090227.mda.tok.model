the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of this report 
overview we are in the business of manufacturing electronics and provide our services to original equipment manufacturers oems of computers and related products for business enterprises  medical devices  industrial control equipment  testing and instrumentation products  and telecommunication equipment 
the services that we provide are commonly referred to as electronics manufacturing services ems 
we offer our customers comprehensive and integrated design and manufacturing services  from initial product design to volume production and direct order fulfillment 
our manufacturing and assembly operations include printed circuit boards and subsystem assembly  box build and systems integration  the process of integrating subsystems and  often  downloading and integrating software  to produce a fully configured product 
we also provide specialized engineering services  including product design  printed circuit board layout  prototyping  and test development 
we believe that we have developed strengths in the manufacturing process for large  complex  high density printed circuit boards as well as the ability to manufacture high and low volume products in lower cost regions such as brazil  china  malaysia  mexico  romania and thailand 
as our customers have continued to expand their globalization strategy during the past several years  we have made the necessary changes to align our business operations with our customers demand 
these changes include  among other activities  moving production between facilities  reducing staff levels  realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management 
during the year ended december   the company recognized million pre tax of restructuring charges  primarily employee termination costs associated with the involuntary terminations of employees in connection with reductions in workforce of certain facilities 
during the year ended december   we incurred million pre tax of restructuring charges  primarily related to the closure of our redmond  washington facility  the transfer of the company s printed circuit board assembly pcba operations in dublin  ireland to brasov  romania and the consolidation and resizing of certain other facilities  as we continued to expand our low cost capacity while realigning and further strengthening our global footprint to support continued business opportunities 
in connection with the acquisition of pemstar inc pemstar on january   a total of million pre tax in integration costs were incurred during the year ended december  these costs included redundant operating costs that have been eliminated 
we believe that our global manufacturing presence increases our ability to be responsive to our customers needs by providing accelerated time to market and time to volume production of high quality products 
these capabilities should enable us to build stronger strategic relationships with our customers and to become a more integral part of their operations 
our customers face challenges in planning  procuring and managing their inventories efficiently due to customer demand fluctuations  product design changes  short product life cycles and component price fluctuations 
we employ production management systems to manage their procurement and manufacturing processes in an efficient and cost effective manner so that  where possible  components arrive on a just in time  as and when needed basis 
we are a significant purchaser of electronic components and other raw materials  and can capitalize on the economies of scale associated with our relationships with suppliers to negotiate price discounts  obtain components and other raw materials that are in short supply  and return excess components 
our expertise in supply chain management and our relationships with suppliers across the supply chain enables us to reduce our customers cost of goods sold and inventory exposure 
we recognize revenue from the sale of circuit board assemblies  systems and excess inventory when the goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from design  development and engineering services is recognized when the services are performed and collectibility is reasonably certain 
such services provided under fixed price contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment as we typically warrant workmanship only 
therefore  our warranty provisions are immaterial 
our cost of sales includes the cost of materials  electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
our procurement of materials for production requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
our gross margin for any product depends on the sales price  the proportionate mix of the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically have the potential to realize higher gross margins on products where the proportionate level of labor and manufacturing overhead is greater than that of materials 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product and higher gross margins 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
recent acquisition effective january   we acquired pemstar inc pemstar  a publicly traded ems company headquartered in rochester  minnesota the merger 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger among benchmark and pemstar dated october  the merger agreement  each issued and outstanding share of common stock  par value per share  of pemstar was converted into the right to receive of a common share  par value per share  of benchmark 
with the closing of the merger  pemstar became a wholly owned subsidiary of benchmark 
this acquisition expanded our customer base and deepened our engineering and systems integration capabilities 
we accounted for the merger utilizing the accounting principles promulgated by statement of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and therefore  the results of operations of the pemstar operations since january  have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the inclusion of the operations of the acquired facilities in benchmark s accounts is responsible for a substantial portion of the variations in the results of our operations including components thereof from to the effects of the merger on our financial condition and our reported results of operations should be considered when reading the financial information contained herein 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
summary of results sales for the year ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
sales to customers in the computers and related products for business enterprises industry and the testing and instrumentation products industry declined and  respectively  from to sales to our largest customer  sun microsystems  inc  represented of our sales in compared to of our sales in sales to this customer decreased million from million in to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to a combination of reduced demand and partly due to the timing of certain product transitions as well as a second sourcing strategy 
in  these declines were partially offset by sales increases to customers in the industrial control equipment an increase of and telecommunication equipment an increase of industries 
our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers  some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to our major customers or their products  or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services  could have an adverse effect on us 
recent unfavorable economic conditions and uncertainty because of fluctuating circumstances in the global financial markets is impacting businesses around the globe 
the global economic downturn has had a negative affect on demand for our customers products and thus adversely affected our sales 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales in and was in each year 
we do experience fluctuations in gross profit from period to period 
different programs can contribute different gross profits depending on factors such as the types of services involved  location of production  size of the program  complexity of the product  and level of material costs associated with the various products 
new programs can contribute relatively less to our gross profit in their early stages when manufacturing volumes are usually lower  resulting in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  new and higher volume programs remain subject to competitive constraints that could exert downward pressure on our margins 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced gross profit 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of the receivables 
to evaluate a specific customer s ability to pay  we analyze financial statements  payment history  third party credit analysis reports and various information or disclosures by the customer or other publicly available information 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us  we set up a specific allowance in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory obsolescence reserve we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reserve for estimated obsolescence as necessary in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demands and market conditions 
we evaluate our inventory valuation on a quarterly basis based on current and forecasted usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
customers frequently make changes to their forecasts  requiring us to make changes to our inventory purchases  commitments  and production scheduling and may require us to cancel open purchase commitments with our vendors 
this process may lead to on hand inventory quantities and on order purchase commitments that are in excess of our customer s revised needs  or parts that become obsolete before use in production 
we record inventory reserves on excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are established on inventory which we have determined that our customers are not responsible for or on inventory which we believe our customers will be unable to fulfill their obligation to ultimately purchase 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
we are subject to examination by tax authorities for varying periods in various us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
during the course of such examinations disputes occur as to matters of fact and or law 
also  in most tax jurisdictions the passage of time without examination will result in the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations thereby precluding the taxing authority from conducting an examination of the tax period s for which such statute of limitations has expired 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our tax liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge would be recognized by the amount that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  by determining the fair values of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparing those fair values to the carrying values  including goodwill  of the reporting unit 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated there was an impairment of goodwill in two of our reporting units  the americas and europe  primarily due to a decline in our market capitalization and recent market turmoil 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of totaling million 
at december   we had net goodwill of approximately million 
circumstances that may lead to future impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy or other factors 
stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised and the security and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  we began recognizing stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income on january  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the option and the expected stock price volatility 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of option awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation could increase or decrease

year ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles restructuring charges and integration costs goodwill impairment income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our sales by industry for and computers and related products for business enterprises telecommunication equipment industrial control equipment medical devices testing and instrumentation products a substantial percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers  and the loss of a major customer  if not replaced  would adversely affect us 
sales to customers in the computers and related products for business enterprises industry and the testing and instrumentation products industry declined and  respectively  from to sales to our largest customer  sun microsystems  inc  represented of our sales in compared to of our sales in sales to this customer decreased million from million in to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to a combination of reduced demand for products and partly due to the timing of certain product transitions as well as a second sourcing strategy 
in  these declines were partially offset by sales increases to customers in the industrial control equipment and telecommunication equipment industries 
our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers  some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to our major customers or their products  or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services  could have an adverse effect on us 
recent unfavorable economic conditions and uncertainty because of fluctuating circumstances in the global financial markets is impacting our customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
these risks have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations through december  however  we can make no assurances that there will not be an adverse impact in the future 
see item a for factors pertaining to our international sales and fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency and for further discussion of potential adverse effects in operating results associated with the risks of doing business abroad 
during and  and  respectively  of our sales were from our international operations 
we had a backlog of approximately billion at december   as compared to the year end backlog of billion 
backlog consists of purchase orders received  including  in some instances  forecast requirements released for production under customer contracts 
although we expect to fill substantially all of our backlog at december  during  we do not have long term agreements with all of our customers and customer orders can be canceled  changed or delayed by customers 
the timely replacement of canceled  changed or delayed orders with orders from new customers cannot be assured  nor can there be any assurance that any of our current customers will continue to utilize our services 
because of these factors  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future financial results 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million for from million in as a result of a decrease in sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was during and we experience fluctuations in gross profit from period to period 
different programs contribute different gross profits depending on factors such as the types of services involved  location of production  size of the program  complexity of the product  and level of material costs associated with the various products 
moreover  new programs can contribute relatively less to our gross profit in their early stages when manufacturing volumes are usually lower  resulting in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  a number of our new and higher volume programs remain subject to competitive constraints that could exert downward pressure on our margins 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were and  respectively  for and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to reduced overhead resulting from cost controls and lower variable compensation and employee related expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily associated with the impact of lower sales volumes in restructuring charges and integration costs we recognized million in restructuring charges during primarily related to reductions in workforce in certain facilities around the globe 
the recognition of the restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
goodwill impairment our annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated there was an impairment of goodwill in two of our reporting units  the americas and europe  primarily due to a decline in our market capitalization and recent market turmoil 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of million 
interest expense interest expense for and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease is due to the repayment of the debt assumed in the merger 
the remaining debt outstanding is primarily a long term capital lease on one facility that was assumed in the merger 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax benefit expense income tax benefit of million represented an effective tax rate of for  compared with income tax expense million at an effective tax rate of for the same period in the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to non deductible goodwill impairment recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
net income loss we reported net income loss of approximately million  or a loss per diluted share of for  compared with net income of approximately million  or per diluted share for the net decrease of million in was due to the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  and were billion in each year 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our sales by industry for and computers and related products for business enterprises telecommunication equipment medical devices industrial control equipment testing and instrumentation products during and  and  respectively  of our sales were from our international operations 
we had a backlog of approximately billion at december   as compared to the year end backlog of billion 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million for from million in gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to during from in due primarily to under absorbed costs 
our margin was also impacted by inefficiencies and resources necessary for the integration activities related to the acquisitions in  as well as the closing of several facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were and  respectively  for and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily associated with the merger 
restructuring charges and integration costs we recognized million in restructuring charges and integration costs during related to reductions in workforce  the re sizing and closure of certain facilities and the integration of the facilities acquired in the merger 
interest expense interest expense for and was million and million  respectively 
the increase is due to interest expense on the debt assumed in the merger 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense income tax expense of million represented an effective tax rate of for  compared with million at an effective tax rate of for the same period in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit of million recorded in the third quarter of related to a previously closed facility that generated a worthless stock deduction and an increase in tax exempt income in certain foreign locations in in  a discrete tax benefit of million related to the closure of our leicester  england facility was recorded in the first quarter 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
net income we reported net income of approximately million  or diluted earnings per share of for  compared with net income of approximately million  or diluted earnings per share of for the net decrease of million in was due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our growth and operations through funds generated from operations  proceeds from the sale and maturity of our investments and funds borrowed under our credit facilities 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in the cash provided by operations during consisted primarily of a net loss of million adjusted for million of goodwill impairments  million of depreciation and amortization  a million decrease in accounts receivable  and a million decrease in inventories offset by a million decrease in accounts payable 
working capital was million at december  and million at december  as of december   the million of long term investments consist of auction rate securities that were reclassified to long term during the three months ended march   due to the overall changes that occurred in the global credit and capital markets that have led to failed auctions 
these failed auctions  in addition to the overall global economic conditions  have impacted the liquidity of these investments and have resulted in our continuing to hold these securities beyond their typical auction reset dates 
the decrease in working capital during is primarily a result of this reclassification from short term to long term investments  in addition to other items 
we are continuing the practice of purchasing components only after customer orders are received  which mitigates  but does not eliminate the risk of loss on inventories 
supplies of electronic components and other materials used in operations are subject to industry wide shortages 
in certain instances  suppliers may allocate available quantities to us 
we did not experience shortages of electronic components and other material supplies during the reporting period 
if shortages of these components and other material supplies used in operations occur  vendors may not ship the quantities we need for production and we may be forced to delay shipments  which would increase backorders 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to the sale and maturities of investments offset by the purchases of investments and additional property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures of million were primarily concentrated in manufacturing production equipment in the americas and asia to support our ongoing business and to expand certain existing manufacturing operations 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   share repurchases totaled million 
during  we received million from the exercise of stock options and million in federal tax benefits of stock options exercised 
principal payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations were million in under the terms of a credit agreement the credit agreement  we have a million five year revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes with a maturity date of december  the credit agreement includes an accordion feature under which total commitments under the facility may be increased by an additional million  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement is payable quarterly  at our option  at libor plus to or a prime rate plus to  based upon our debt ratio as specified in the credit agreement 
a commitment fee of to per annum based upon our debt ratio on the unused portion of the revolving credit line is payable quarterly in arrears 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement  million in outstanding letters of credit and million was available for future borrowings 
the credit agreement is secured by our domestic inventory and accounts receivable  of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries  and of the voting capital stock of each direct foreign subsidiary and substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries other tangible and intangible assets 
the credit agreement contains customary financial covenants as to working capital  debt leverage  fixed charges  and consolidated net worth  and restricts our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  sell assets and to merge or consolidate with other persons 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants and restrictions 
our thailand subsidiary has a credit agreement with kasikornbank public company the thai credit agreement 
the thai credit agreement provides that the lender will make available to our thailand subsidiary up to approximately million in revolving loans and machinery loans 
the thai credit agreement is secured by land  buildings and machinery in thailand 
in addition  the thai credit agreement provides for approximately million million thai baht in working capital availability in the form of working capital loans million thai baht and bank guarantees million thai baht 
availability of funds under the thai credit agreement is reviewed annually and is currently accessible through september as of december   our thailand subsidiary had no working capital borrowings outstanding 
our operations  and the operations of businesses we acquire  are subject to certain foreign  federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental  waste management  health and safety matters 
we believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements and we seek to ensure that newly acquired businesses comply or will comply substantially with applicable requirements 
to date  the costs of compliance and workplace and environmental remediation have not been material to us 
however  material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new  modified or more stringent requirements in the future 
in addition  our past  current and future operations  and the operations of businesses we have or may acquire  may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public  or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental  waste management or health and safety concerns 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million available for borrowings under our revolving credit line 
we believe that during the next twelve months  our capital expenditures will be approximately to million  principally for machinery and equipment to support our ongoing business around the globe 
on july   the company completed the repurchase of million shares under the million share repurchase program approved in july on july   our board of directors approved the additional repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common shares the repurchase program 
during  the company repurchased a total of million common shares for million at an average price of per share 
we have million remaining under the repurchase program to repurchase additional shares 
we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common shares and share purchases may be suspended at any time at management s discretion 
management believes that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next twelve months 
management further believes that our ongoing cash flows from operations and any borrowings we may incur under our credit facilities will enable us to meet operating cash requirements in future years 
should we desire to consummate significant acquisition opportunities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facility or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
contractual obligations we have certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond under lease obligations and debt arrangements 
non cancelable purchase commitments do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable 
we do not utilize off balance sheet financing techniques other than traditional operating leases and we have not guaranteed the obligations of any entity that is not one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the total contractual cash obligations in existence at december  due pursuant to contractual commitments are payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total obligations we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million 
we have not provided a detailed estimate of the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance due to the uncertainty of when the related tax settlements will become due 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our international sales are a significant portion of our net sales  we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  including the following foreign currency exchange risk  import and export duties  taxes and regulatory changes  inflationary economies or currencies  and economic and political instability 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency hedges 
in the future  significant transactions involving our international operations may cause us to consider engaging in hedging transactions to attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures are primarily  but not limited to  vendor payments and intercompany balances in currencies other than the currency in which our foreign operations primarily generate and expend cash 
our international operations in some instances operate in a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
our sales are substantially denominated in us dollars 
our foreign currency cash flows are generated in certain asian and european countries  mexico and brazil 
we are also exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates  a portion of which relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place cash and cash equivalents and investments with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by generally investing in investment grade securities 
as of december   the outstanding amount in the long term investment portfolio included million par value of auction rate securities with an average return of approximately
