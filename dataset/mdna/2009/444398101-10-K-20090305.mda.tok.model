table of contents significant transactions through a series of transactions from to  we acquired the businesses that we owned as of december  an overview of those transactions is as follows on april   skyterra acquired of hns voting  or class a membership interests the april transaction from dtv network systems  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the directv group  inc 
directv 
on october   we acquired series a preferred shares of hughes systique corporation hughes systique for million 
on january   the company invested an additional million in the common equity of hughes systique 
as a result  the company owns approximately of the outstanding shares of hughes systique  on an undiluted basis  at december  on december   pursuant to separation agreement between us and skyterra the separation agreement  skyterra contributed to us the following its ownership of hns voting  or class a  membership interests  its interests in i afrihub llc  a discontinued business  ii electronic system products  inc esp  and iii certain minority investments  and cash and short term investments 
on january   we completed our purchase of the remaining of hns class a membership interests for million in cash the january transaction pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement we entered into with directv on november  to finance the purchase  we borrowed million from certain of skyterra s controlling stockholders  various investment vehicles that are affiliated with apollo management  lp together with its affiliates  apollo 
the loan was repaid in march following the completion of the rights offering conducted by us 
as a result of the january transaction  we own of hns class a membership interests  and our consolidated financial statements for periods beginning on or after january  include the results of hns and its controlled  majority owned subsidiaries 
on february   skyterra distributed all of our outstanding shares of common stock to skyterra s common  non voting common and preferred stockholders and its series a and a warrant holders the distribution 
the distribution separated skyterra into two publicly traded companies skyterra and hci 
accordingly  skyterra no longer owns any of our capital stock  and apollo  skyterra s controlling stockholder at the time of the distribution  became our controlling stockholder 
following the distribution  skyterra retained its interest in its other assets  including cash and investments 
notwithstanding the legal form of the distribution  we are treated as the accounting successor to skyterra for financial reporting purposes 
this accounting was required because  among other things  i the businesses transferred to the company generated all of skyterra s historical consolidated revenues and constituted a majority of the book value of skyterra s assets immediately preceding the distribution and ii the businesses transferred to the company included skyterra s discontinued operating subsidiaries and all of the assets and liabilities relating to such subsidiaries 
the company s results for periods beginning on or after january   the date on which the company completed the january transaction  included the results of the business and assets retained by skyterra through the distribution date and reflected hns results of operations 
on march   we completed a rights offering  pursuant to which we issued  shares of our common stock to our stockholders at a subscription price of per share 
in connection with the rights offering  we received proceeds of million  of which million was received from apollo 

table of contents distribution on february   skyterra completed the distribution and separated into two publicly traded companies i hughes communications  inc  which consists of  among other things  the assets  liabilities and operations associated with hns and esp and certain minority investments in entities including data synapse  inc  edmunds holdings  inc  mainstream data  inc  and hughes systique  along with all of skyterra s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding million  and certain other liabilities expressly allocated from skyterra and ii skyterra  which consists of the assets and liabilities associated with skyterra s interest in mobile satellite ventures lp msv and skyterra s stake in terrestar networks  inc terrestar  million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and the obligations pursuant to skyterra s series a preferred stock 
to effect the distribution  skyterra distributed to each of its stockholders one half of one share of our common stock for each share of skyterra common stock or  in the case of holders of skyterra preferred stock and series a and a warrants  in accordance with their terms  one half of one share of our common stock for each share of skyterra common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of such preferred stock and warrants 
pursuant to skyterra s long term incentive plan  the compensation committee of skyterra s board of directors is required to make an equitable adjustment to the terms of options issued under that plan in the event a special  large and nonrecurring dividend or distribution affects skyterra s common stock such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the participants under such plan 
skyterra s compensation committee has discretion to make such an adjustment to any option issued under the plan by adjusting the number and kind of shares that may be issued in respect of outstanding options or the exercise price relating to such options 
pursuant to this provision  skyterra s compensation committee determined that holders of stock options issued under the plan who were current members of skyterra s management and board of directors  as well as a consultant and former directors who were involved with the acquisition of hns  should receive an option to purchase one share of our common stock for each option to purchase two shares of skyterra s common stock that they held as of the date of the distribution 
the issuance of such options to purchase our common stock was in lieu of a larger adjustment to the exercise price of skyterra s options that such holders would have been otherwise entitled had they not received options to purchase our common stock 
a reduction in the exercise price or in some cases  an increase in the number of shares was the manner in which all of skyterra s other options outstanding under the plan were adjusted 
on february   options to purchase  shares of our common stock were issued to holders of skyterra options 
separation agreement we entered into the separation agreement with skyterra effective december   which affected the transfer  by way of contribution from skyterra to us  of the assets related to our business  and the assumption by us of certain liabilities 
the separation agreement and certain related agreements govern  among other things  certain of the ongoing relations between us and skyterra following the distribution 
in general  pursuant to the terms of the separation agreement  all of skyterra s assets and liabilities  other than those specifically relating to msv and terrestar  million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and the obligations pursuant to skyterra s series a preferred stock  became our assets and liabilities 
the separation agreement also provides for assumptions of liabilities and cross indemnities designed to allocate generally  effective as of the date of the separation agreement  financial responsibility for all liabilities arising out of or in connection with our businesses to us and all liabilities arising out of or in connection with skyterra s interest in msv and terrestar to skyterra 
in addition  we will indemnify skyterra for liabilities relating to certain litigation in which skyterra or skyterra s subsidiaries were involved 
furthermore  the company has a tax sharing agreement with skyterra that governs the allocation of tax liabilities and related tax matters  such as the preparation and filing of tax returns and tax contests  between the company and skyterra for all taxable periods ended on or before the distribution date 

table of contents strategic initiatives and their impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and  we generated net income of million  million and a net loss of million  respectively 
net income for the year ended december  was adversely impacted by two initiatives related to our operations that did not exist in the comparable periods in and these initiatives  which support our future growth in services and the retention of employees  were i the recognition of depreciation expense of million related to the commencement of spaceway services in april and ii the accrual of compensation expense of million related to a one time retention program as described in note long term cash incentive retention program included in item of this report 
we expect our long term results of operations to improve over time as we add subscribers on the spaceway network 
consumer group we have made significant investments in our consumer group as we believe there is a large segment of this market that is underserved by terrestrial alternatives such as digital subscriber line dsl and cable 
we continue to review and adjust pricing policies relative to other competitive offerings in the marketplace in connection with our consumer hardware and service offerings 
in september  we began offering customers the option to rent the equipment with a month service contract 
we believe that the consumer rental program will expand our customer base while providing customers with an economical alternative to purchasing the equipment 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs  including subscriber acquisition costs  related to hardware and associated marketing costs 
at december   we had a consumer customer base of approximately  subscribers that generated revenues of million 
satellite related assets as part of our focus on less costly and more efficient technological solutions  we have constructed and developed the spaceway tm satellite spaceway as well as related network operations center facilities  certain other ground facilities and equipment 
the spaceway system was designed and developed as the next generation ka band broadband satellite system with a unique architecture for broadband data communications 
designed for maximum operational flexibility  the system greatly enhances data communication capabilities and efficiencies for enterprise and consumer customers 
in august  we launched spaceway and introduced service in north america on the spaceway network in april we believe that the spaceway system enables us to offer our north american enterprise and consumer customers faster communication rates  reduce our operating costs in the future  primarily through the reduction of third party transponder capacity expenses as we utilize the additional capacity of spaceway  and expand our business significantly by increasing our addressable market in the enterprise and consumer markets 
however  we have incurred fixed costs associated with the launch and operation of spaceway that has reduced and will continue to reduce our earnings until we acquire a sufficient number of customers to offset those costs 
the company continues to evaluate the requirements for additional space segment capacity  including the acquisition of another satellite 
the company is considering various alternatives related to the ownership structure of a new satellite  capacity features and other factors that would promote long term growth while meeting the needs of its customers 
technology we have incorporated advances in semiconductor technology to increase the functionality and reliability of our vsats and reduce manufacturing costs 
in addition  through the usage of advanced spectrally efficient modulation and coding methodologies  such as dvb s  and proprietary software web acceleration and compression techniques  we continue to improve the efficiency of our transponder capacity and invest in our research and development efforts to maintain our position as a leader in vsat technology 
acquisitions  strategic alliances and divestitures we continue to focus on expanding the identified markets for our products  services and network solutions in our north america vsat  international vsat and telecom systems segments 
consistent with this strategy to grow and improve our financial position  we also review our competitive position on an ongoing basis and  from time to time  consider various acquisitions  strategic alliances and divestitures which we believe would be beneficial to our business 

table of contents in february  we acquired helius  inc  which was subsequently converted to a limited liability company  helius  llc helius  and transferred our ownership of helius to hns 
helius operates within our north america vsat segment due to the nature of its business activities  its customer base and similarities with the north america enterprise business 
we believe that the combination of helius internet protocol television solutions and our extensive broadband networking experience and customer base will create synergies that facilitate long term sales growth 
for further discussion of this acquisition  see note acquisition of helius  inc to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
broadband market focus in  our results of operations were negatively impacted by our decision to shift our primary focus exclusively to the broadband market 
accordingly  we evaluated the narrowband products in our inventory and recorded a charge in the second quarter of of million for excess or obsolete inventories to reduce net book value of the narrowband products to their net realizable value  and substantially all of these products were disposed of during this charge was included in cost of hardware products sold and primarily related to the north america vsat segment 
key business metrics business segments we divide our operations into four distinct segments the north america vsat segment  the international vsat segment  the telecom systems segment and the corporate and other segment 
within the north america vsat segment  sales can be attributed to the consumer group and the enterprise group 
within the international vsat segment  sales can be attributed to the enterprise group  which includes our international service companies 
sales from our telecom systems segment can be attributed to the mobile satellite systems group  the telematics group  and the terrestrial microwave group 
the corporate and other segment consists of various minority investments held by the company  our corporate offices and assets not specifically related to another business segment 
due to the complementary nature and common architecture of our services and products across our business lines  we are able to leverage our expertise and resources within our various operating units to yield significant cost efficiencies 
revenues we generate revenues from the sale and financing of hardware and the provision of services 
in our north america and international vsat segments  we generate revenues from services and hardware  while in our telecom systems segment  we generate revenues primarily from the development and sale of hardware 
some of our large enterprise vsat customers  who purchase equipment separately  operate their own networks 
these customers include large enterprises  incumbent local exchange carriers  governmental agencies and resellers 
contracts for our vsat services vary in length depending on the customer s requirements 

table of contents services our services revenue is varied in nature and includes total turnkey communications services  terminal relocation  maintenance and changes  transponder capacity and multicast or broadcast services 
our services are offered on a contractual basis  which vary in length based on the particular end market 
typically  our large enterprise customers enter into a service contract with a three to five year duration and our consumer customers enter into a month contract 
we bill and recognize service revenues on a monthly per site basis

we have the ability to integrate these service offerings to provide comprehensive solutions for our customers 
we also provide managed services to our customers who operate their own dedicated network facilities and charge them a management fee for the operation and support of their networks 
hardware we offer our enterprise customers the option to purchase their equipment up front or as part of their service agreement under which payments are made over a fixed term 
our consumer customers have the option to purchase the equipment up front or  beginning in september  to rent the equipment with a month service contract 
prior to september  we offered our consumer customers the option to pay for the purchased equipment over a month period 
hardware revenues of the north american and international enterprise groups are derived from network operating centers  radio frequency terminals earth stations  vsat components including indoor units  outdoor units  antennas  voice  video  serial data appliances  and system integration services to integrate all of the above into a system 
we also provide specialized equipment to our mobile satellite systems  telematics  and terrestrial microwave customers 
through large multi year contracts  we develop and supply turnkey networking and terminal systems for various operators who offer mobile satellite based or telematics voice and data services 
we also supply microwave based networking equipment to mobile operators for back hauling their data from cellular 
table of contents telephone sites to their switching centers 
in addition  local exchange carriers use our equipment for broadband access traffic from corporations bypassing local phone companies 
the size and scope of these projects vary from year to year and do not follow a pattern that can be reasonably predicted

table of contents north america vsat segment the growth in our consumer group has been driven primarily by two factors i the substantial growth in the number of subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness in geographic areas that have historically been underserved by dsl and cable and ii targeted service plans  with higher prices coincident with higher broadband capacity to meet the consumer customer s broadband access requirements  as well as value added services  resulting in an increase in average monthly revenue per subscriber 
revenue from our north american enterprise group for the year ended december  increased slightly by to million compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in our managed services business 
enterprise hardware revenue can be impacted by the timing of renewals and upgrades of existing contracts  as well as award and delivery of new contracts 
enterprise service revenue is generally characterized by long term contracts  and our enterprise backlog continues to increase as a result of new orders for enterprise services 
international vsat segment revenue from our international enterprise group for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to the same period in  primarily due to the growth of our brazil and europe operations as we continue to offer an expanding array of solutions and services to enterprises and government organizations across emerging markets 
additionally  we continue to offer terrestrial and satellite access in our managed network service offerings 
telecom systems segment revenue from our telematics group for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to the same period in contributing to the growth was increased engineering efforts on new projects involving automotive telematics solutions and for the design  development and supply of user terminals and chipset related development 
we continue to actively pursue a number of opportunities in the area of hybrid satellite terrestrial mobile networks and automotive telematics solutions 
revenue from our terrestrial microwave group for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to the same period in  due to orders from new customers in europe and africa 
in this group  we pursue revenue opportunities through sales of point to multipoint equipment to international mobile and fixed wireless operators for backhauling their base station traffic to their switching centers 
revenue backlog at december   and  our total revenue backlog  which we define as our expected future revenue under customer contracts that are non cancelable and excluding consumer customers  was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to realize our revenue backlog as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
see item a 
risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the potential risks to our revenue and backlog 
although we have signed contracts with our consumer customers for months  we do not include these contractual commitments in our backlog 
cost of services our cost of services relates to the costs associated with the provision of managed network services  which primarily consist of transponder capacity leases  hub infrastructure  customer care  terrestrial capacity  depreciation expense related to network infrastructure and capitalized hardware under the consumer rental program  which we began offering to consumer customers in september  and the salaries and related employment costs for those employees who manage our network operations and other project areas 
these costs are dependent on the number of customers served and have increased relative to our growth 
we continue to execute a number of cost containment and efficiency initiatives that were implemented during   and in addition  the migration to a single upgraded platform for our north america vsat segment has enabled 
table of contents us to leverage our satellite bandwidth and network operation facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies 
the costs associated with transponder capacity leases for the consumer group are expected to decline as more customers are added to the spaceway network 
in recent years  transponder capacity has not been a limiting factor in growing the vsat service business 
transponder capacity is typically sold under long term contracts by fixed satellite service providers  and we are continually evaluating the need to secure additional capacity with sufficient lead time to permit us to provide reliable service to our customers 
cost of hardware products sold we outsource a significant portion of the manufacturing of our hardware for our north america and international vsat and telecom systems segments to third party contract manufacturers 
our cost of hardware products sold relates primarily to direct materials and subsystems eg  antennas  salaries and related employment costs for those employees who are directly associated with the procurement and manufacture of our products and other items of indirect overhead incurred in the procurement and production process 
cost of hardware products sold also includes certain engineering and hardware costs related to the design of a particular product for specific customer programs 
in addition  certain software development costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed and amortized to cost of hardware products sold over their estimated useful lives  not to exceed five years 
as we have developed new product offerings  we have reduced product costs due to higher levels of component integration  design improvements and volume increases 
subscriber acquisition costs sac are associated with our consumer group and are comprised of three elements i the subsidy for the cost of hardware and related installation  ii sales and marketing expense  and iii dealer and customer service representative commissions on new installations activations 
the subsidy for cost of hardware and related cost of installation is deferred and amortized over the initial contract period or the useful life of the hardware as a component of cost of hardware products sold for hardware related sales or cost of services for activities related to the consumer rental program 
the portion of sac related to sales and marketing is expensed as incurred 
dealer and customer service representative commissions are deferred and amortized over the initial contract period as a component of sales and marketing expense 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses primarily consist of the salaries  commissions  related benefit costs of our direct sales force and marketing staff  advertising  channel compensations on new activations which are deferred and amortized over the initial consumer contract period  travel  allocation of facilities  and other directly related overhead costs for our domestic and international businesses

table of contents  subscribers to approximately  subscribers at december  and an increase in arpu of to for also contributing to the increase in services revenues was revenue growth from our north america equipment and services group of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  mainly due to increase in our managed services business as well as new contracts awarded in and that provided incremental service revenue in the increase in services revenue was also driven by an increase in revenue from our telecom systems segment of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  which primarily resulted from an increase in design and development engineering services provided by our telematics group 
services revenue from our international vsat segment decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  mainly resulting from a reduction in revenue from our european operations as a result of the completion of legacy service contracts 
hardware sales hardware sales increased mainly due to revenue growth from our international vsat segment of million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the continued rollout of terminal shipments on a new  multi year contract for a large lottery operator in the united kingdom  partially offset by delays in us sourced new orders from enterprise customers 
hardware sales from our telecom systems segment for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the same period in the increase resulted from higher hardware sales from the terrestrial microwave group  primarily due to orders from new and existing customers in europe and africa 
partially offsetting the increase in hardware sales was a reduction in revenue from our north america vsat segment of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a revenue reduction of million in our north america enterprise group as a result of a change in the product mix where the emphasis on managed services has led to lower upfront hardware revenue and an increase in recurring service revenues 
in addition  despite the growth in the subscriber base  hardware sales in the consumer group decreased by million to million in  resulting from increasing popularity of the equipment rental program  as well as changes in pricing plans in response to competitive pressures 
costs of revenues year ended december  variance dollars in thousands amount cost of services cost of hardware products sold total cost of revenues services cost as a of services revenues hardware cost as a of hardware revenues cost of services cost of services increased mainly as a result of revenue growth from our north american enterprise group 
the increase was partly due to million of fixed expenses related to the commencement of spaceway 
table of contents services  which primarily consisted of spaceway related depreciation  as well as related network operations center and support  operation of traffic off load gateways  and in orbit insurance 
these costs are generally fixed in nature and are expected to be absorbed in the coming quarters as additional consumer customers are added to the spaceway network 
the increase in cost of services was also due to higher transponder capacity lease expense of million in compared to  mainly resulting from additional space capacity acquired to support the growth in the enterprise service business from the north america equipment and services group 
the increase in additional space capacity for the enterprise services business was partially offset by a reduction in transponder capacity lease expense for the consumer group as new consumer customers were added to the spaceway network 
we expect transponder capacity lease expense for the consumer group to continue to decrease as more customers are placed on the spaceway network 
in addition  other support costs including customer service  network operations  field services and backhaul costs and depreciation expense increased by million 
cost of hardware products sold cost of hardware products sold increased in conjunction with the growth in hardware sales 
the increase was mainly attributable to higher cost of hardware products sold from our international vsat segment of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the continued rollout of terminal shipments on a new  multi year contract for a large lottery operator in the united kingdom  partially offset by a decrease in us sourced shipments to our international enterprise customers 
in addition  cost of hardware products sold from the telecom system segment increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was due to engineering and manufacturing costs related to the design and manufacturing of user terminals and chipset related development  as well as  product costs associated with the sale of point to multipoint equipment from the terrestrial microwave group 
cost of hardware products sold from the north america vsat segment remained flat for compared to as a result of the commencement of spaceway services and changes in consumer pricing plans implemented in  cost of hardware products sold from the consumer group increased slightly 
however  the increase in cost of hardware product sold in the consumer group was offset by the reduction in cost of hardware products sold in the north america network equipment and service group due to lower hardware revenues 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense year ended december  variance dollars in thousands amount selling  general and administrative expense of revenue sg a expense increased primarily due to higher costs of million related to a one time retention program the retention program in connection with the april  transaction between directv and skyterra 
further contributing to the increase in sg a expense was additional domestic selling  advertising and customer service costs of million as well as additional sg a expense from helius  which we acquired in february for further discussion of the retention program  see note long term cash incentive retention program to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

table of contents seasonality like many communications infrastructure equipment vendors  a significant amount of our hardware sales occur in the second half of the year due to our customers annual procurement and budget cycles 
large enterprises and operators usually allocate their capital expenditure budgets at the beginning of their fiscal year which often coincides with the calendar year 
the typical sales cycle for large complex system procurements is to months  which often results in the customer expenditure occurring towards the end of the year 
customers often seek to expend the budgeted funds prior to the end of the year and the next budget cycle 
as a result  interim results are not indicative of the results to be expected for the full year 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
certain relationships and related transactions for a discussion of related party transactions  see note transactions with related parties to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition service revenues and hardware sales  excluding lease revenues described below  are recognized when services are rendered or products are installed or shipped to third party installers and as title passes to those customers 
in situations where customer offerings represent a bundled arrangement for both services and hardware  revenue elements are separated into their relevant components services or hardware for revenue recognition purposes 
the company offers a rebate to qualifying new consumer subscribers and records a reduction in revenue in the same period the related sale occurs based on an estimate of the number of rebates that will be redeemed 
this estimate is based on historical experience and actual sales during the promotion 
in addition to providing standard product and service offerings  the company also enters into contracts to design  develop and deliver telecommunication networks to customers 
these contracts for telecommunication networks require significant effort to develop and construct the network  over an extended time period 
revenues are also earned from long term contracts for the sale of mobile satellite communications systems 
sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting 
under this method  sales are recorded equivalent to costs incurred plus a portion of the profit expected to be realized  determined based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
profits expected to be realized on long term contracts are based on estimates of total sales value and costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the revisions are made 
estimated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they are identified 

table of contents business combinations and intangible assets the company has participated in several significant transactions since april which have impacted the company s financial statements 
the company accounts for business combinations in accordance sfas no 
 business combinations 
the acquisition of businesses is an element of the company s strategy 
under the purchase method  the company is required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s financial statements 
intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations which have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on estimates of the period during which the assets are expected to generate revenue 
intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may no longer be recoverable 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining provisions for income taxes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each reporting date and where applicable  record a valuation allowance to reduce the total deferred tax assets to amounts that will  more likely than not  be realized in the future 
our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence  including the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted taxable income from operating activities 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment 
in the event that actual taxable income from operating activities differs from forecasted amounts  or if we change our estimates of forecasted taxable income from operating activities  we could record additional charges in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their realizable amounts 
such charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we also review our positions taken or that will be taken on the income tax returns for unrecognized tax benefits  assess whether such unrecognized tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold  and determine the need to record a liability in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  along with any penalty and interest 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations  domestically and internationally 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our determination of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax assessments are probable and estimable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is less than we originally expected  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
subscriber acquisition costs sac the company s consumer group  included in the north america vsat segment  offers internet and data networking services to consumers and small medium businesses in north america 
the products and services are sold to customers using a variety of competitive service packages  through an extensive independent nationwide network of distributors  dealers  sales agents and retail companies 
sac is an important component of our cost to acquire new consumer subscribers 
sac consists of dealer and customer service representative commissions on new installations and  in certain cases  the cost of hardware and installation provided to customers at the inception of service or cost of services for activities related to the consumer rental program 
sac is deferred 
table of contents when a customer commits to a service agreement  and the deferred sac is amortized over the commitment period as the related service revenue is earned 
prior to  service agreements were to months in duration 
in may  the company began to offer only month service agreements 
customers who receive hardware and installation under these service agreements have a higher monthly service rate than is charged to customers who purchase their equipment outright at the inception of service 
the company monitors the recoverability of subscriber acquisition costs and is entitled to an early termination fee secured by customer credit card information if the subscriber cancels service prior to the end of the commitment period 
the recoverability of deferred subscriber acquisition costs is reasonably assured through the increased monthly service fee charged to customers  the ability to recover the equipment  and or the ability to charge an early termination fee

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses referred to below include forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain adverse market conditions may occur 
actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions because the amounts noted below are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof 
accordingly  you should not consider the forward looking statements as projections by us of future events or losses 
general the company s cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and changes in the market value of its equity investments 
the company manages its exposure to those market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company enters into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its risk management objectives and does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk the company generally conducts its business in united states dollars 
however  as its international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies  it is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
at december   the company and its foreign subsidiaries had an estimated million of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables outstanding  of which million had hedge contracts in place to partially mitigate foreign currency risk 
of the million  million is denominated in euros  million is in us dollars and million is in danish kroner 
the differences between the face amount of the foreign exchange contracts and their estimated fair values were not material at december  the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates on the fair value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities would be an estimated loss of million as of december  marketable securities risk we have established an investment policy which governs our investment strategy and stipulates that we diversify investments among united states treasury securities and other high credit quality debt instruments that we believe to be low risk 
the company is averse to principal loss and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
as a result of the current adverse market conditions  we preserve our cash value by holding it in money market funds invested in the us government treasury and agency securities 
at december   we did not have any investment in marketable securities 
interest rate risk the senior notes issued on april  and outstanding borrowings related to very small aperture terminal hardware financing arrangements are not subject to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate is fixed for the term of the instrument 
the company is subject to variable interest rates on certain other debt including the secured million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
to the extent that the company draws against the credit facility  increases in interest rates would have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
additionally  the company is subject to variable interest rates on the million term loan facility the term loan facility  which closed in february the interest on the term loan facility was at adjusted libor as defined in the term loan facility and existing revolving credit facility plus per annum 

table of contents to mitigate the variable interest rate risk associated with the term loan facility  the company entered into the swap agreement with bear stearns capital markets  inc bear stearns  which was acquired by jpmorgan chase co 
jpm in may  to swap the adjusted libor for a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the swap agreement is effective february  and has a termination date of april   which is the maturity date of the term loan facility 
as a result  the interest rate for the term loan facility at december  was 
the net interest payments based on the swap agreement and the term loan facility are paid quarterly and are estimated to be approximately million for each of the years ended december  through and million for the year ended december  the security for our interest obligation to jpm under the swap agreement is the same as the security for the revolving credit facility described in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
market concentration and credit risk the company provides services and extends credit to a number of communications equipment customers  service providers  and a large number of consumers  both in the united states and around the world 
the company monitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains  as necessary  allowances for anticipated losses 
no single customer accounted for more than of total annual revenues in any of the periods presented 
financial instruments which potentially subject the company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments 
although the company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that exceed federally insured limits  these balances are placed with high credit quality financial institutions 
commodity price risk all of our products contain components whose base raw materials have undergone dramatic cost fluctuations in the last months
