pursuant to these agreements  siemens has extended to the company a million credit facility 
the company purchases most of the company s requirements for hearing aids from siemens 
the december agreements represented amendments to agreements that had been in place between the parties since in when the credit agreement was amended  the company granted to siemens the right to convert a portion of the debt into common stock at certain times and upon certain conditions 
pursuant to the supply agreement  the company has agreed to purchase at least of its hearing aid purchases in the united states from siemens and its affiliates 
if the minimum purchase requirement of the supply agreement is met  the company earns rebates which are then applied to certain payments due under the credit agreement to liquidate those payments 
the investor rights agreement provided siemens with certain rights  including the right to have the shares of common stock underlying the debt be registered for resale and a right of first refusal on equity securities sold by the company 
in when the amendments were made  siemens agreed to provide the company with an additional million revolving line of credit for working capital purposes in the form of tranche e which would be due on december  in addition  in the amendments siemens agreed that the million principal of tranche d in the credit agreement would be due on december  in the amendments and the purchase agreement the parties agreed to the following the previous amendment of the credit agreement called for cash payments of million in december on tranches d and e and quarterly principal payments of  on tranche c 
the amendment transferred the amounts due under tranches d and e to tranche c 
providing the company meets the purchase requirements in the supply agreement  all repayments on both tranches can now be self liquidating 
the balances of tranche d and e were transferred to tranche c 
going forward the credit agreement will have only tranches b and c

the maturity date of the credit and supply agreement was extended an additional two years  to february  siemens was granted a right of first refusal for all new issuances of equity except issuances pursuant to employee compensation plans and pursuant to warrants outstanding on the date of the amendments for a period of months and thereafter a more limited right of first refusal and preemptive rights for the life of the investor rights agreement 
the company will invite a representative of siemens to attend meetings of the board in a nonvoting observer capacity 
financing and rebate arrangement the revolving credit facility is a line of credit of million that bears interest of and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
approximately million was outstanding at december  approximately  million has been borrowed under tranche b for acquisitions and million has been borrowed under tranche c 
borrowing for acquisitions under tranche b is generally based upon a formula equal to of of the acquisition s trailing months revenues and any amount greater than that may be borrowed from tranche c with siemens approval 
amounts borrowed under tranche b are repaid quarterly through rebates at a rate of per siemens units sold by the acquisition plus interest 
amounts borrowed under tranche c are repaid quarterly at  plus interest 
the required payments are subject to the rebate credits described below 
the credit facility also requires that the company reduce the principal balance by making annual payments in an amount equal to of excess cash flow as defined in the amended credit agreement  and by paying siemens of proceeds from any equity offerings the company may complete 
the company did not have any excess cash flow as defined in  or rebate credits on product sales the required quarterly principal and interest payments on tranches b and c are forgiven by siemens through rebate credits of similar amounts as long as of hearing aid units sold in the us are siemens products 
amounts rebated are accounted for as a reduction of cost of products sold 
if the company does not maintain the sales requirement  those amounts are not rebated and must be paid quarterly 
the requirement is computed on a cumulative twelve month calculation 
the company has always met the requirement since entering into this arrangement in december and has received approximately million in rebates since that time 
additional quarterly volume rebates of   or  can be earned by meeting certain quarterly volume tests 
these rebates reduce the principal and interest due on tranches b and c and are recorded as a reduction in products sold 
volume rebates of million  million and million were recorded in  and  respectively

conversion of debt for equity prior to the december  amendment to the credit agreement  the company was required to make a payment on december  of million on tranche d and million on tranche e by december  or be declared in default of the agreement 
in addition  the company was required to pay all trade payables within days of the invoice date or be in default of the credit agreement 
if there was an event of default  siemens had the right to convert debt for million shares of the company s common stock at current market price 
rather than paying the million on the two tranches and the trade payables over days  siemens agreed to convert into the million shares at the default terms and allow conversion of the balance of the amounts currently payable into the line of credit 
these terms under which siemens converted the debt into common stock at the current market price were the terms of the original contract for an event of default 
when the company evaluated the original contract for a beneficial conversion feature  the company determined that assuming there were no changes to the current circumstances except for the passage of time  the most favorable conversion price would occur if the company did not repay the million due under the tranche d 
that calculation did not result in a beneficial conversion feature 
since the conversion occurred under the terms that were originally agreed to for the conversion  there is no additional charge 
investor and other rights arrangement pursuant to the amended investor rights agreement  the company granted siemens resale registration rights for the common stock acquired under the purchase agreement 
on february  the company filed the required form s registration statement to register the million shares for resale 
the company is not liable for liquidated damages or penalties 
in addition  for a period of months following the december  amendment  the company has granted to siemens certain rights of first refusal in the event the company chooses to issue equity or if there is a change of control transaction involving a person in the hearing aid industry 
thereafter  siemens will have a more limited right of first refusal and preemptive rights for the life of the agreement 
the siemens credit facility imposes certain financial and other covenants on the company which are customary for loans of this size and nature  including restrictions on the conduct of the company s business  the incurrence of indebtedness  merger or sale of assets  the modification of material agreements  changes in capital structure and making certain payments 
if the company cannot maintain compliance with these covenants  siemens may terminate future funding under the credit facility and declare all then outstanding amounts under the facility immediately due and payable 
in addition  a material breach of the supply agreement or a willful breach of certain of the company s obligations under the investor rights agreement may be declared to be a breach of the credit agreement and siemens would have the right to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility immediately due and payable 
any non compliance with the supply agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and continued operations 
working capital during  the working capital deficit decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in the deficit is mostly attributable to a decrease in trade payables and current maturities of long term debt which arose from the conversion of approximately million in trade payables to long term indebtedness under siemens tranche c  conversion of approximately million in trade payables to million shares of the company s common stock and the elimination of the current maturities of subordinated notes of approximately million following the repayment of these notes in august see note subordinated notes and warrant liability  notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
the working capital deficit of million includes approximately million representing the current maturities of the long term debt to siemens which may be repaid through rebate credits 
in  the company generated income from operations of approximately million reduced by among other things approximately  of non cash employee stock based compensation expense and approximately million of amortization expense of intangible assets compared to million reduced by approximately  of non cash employee stock based compensation expense and approximately  of amortization expense of intangible assets in cash and cash equivalents as of december  were approximately million 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities in was approximately million compared to approximately million in this improvement was mostly associated with an increase in accounts payable of million and income generated from operations of approximately million 
during  cash of approximately million was used to complete the acquisition of centers  a decrease of approximately million and million over the million and million used in and  respectively  as there were fewer acquisitions in it is expected that funds will continue to be used for tranche b and the source of these funds is expected to primarily be from the siemens acquisition line of credit 
in accordance with the amended agreements prior to releasing these funds the company must be cash flow positive prior to the acquisition 
the increase of approximately  in the purchase of property and equipment is due in part to expenditures related to upgrades of centers or relocations in in  funds of approximately million were used to repay long term debt and subordinated notes 
proceeds of million were received from the siemens tranches b and c for acquisitions 
the company expects to continue to draw additional funds from the siemens tranche b in order to pay the cash portion of its acquisitions 
in accordance with the amended agreements prior to releasing these funds the company must be cash flow positive prior to the acquisition 
the company believes that current cash and cash equivalents  cash generated at current net revenue levels and acquisition financing provided by its strategic partner  siemens  will be sufficient to support the company s operating and investing activities through however  there can be no assurance that the company can maintain compliance with the siemens loan covenants  that net revenue levels will remain at or higher than current levels or that unexpected cash needs will not arise for which the cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will not be sufficient 
in the event of a shortfall in cash  the company might consider short term debt  or additional equity or debt offerings 
there can be no assurance however  that such financing will be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
the company is also continuing its aggressive cost controls and sales and gross margin improvements

as of january  we adopted the provisions of sfas r and will account for acquisitions completed after december  in accordance with sfas r 
sfas r revises the manner in which companies account for business combinations and is described more fully elsewhere in this annual report 
we determine the purchase price of an acquisition based on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the net assets acquired  whichever is more clearly evident 
the total purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  management must identify and attribute values and estimated lives to intangible assets acquired 
such determinations involve considerable judgment  and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates and asset lives 
these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
assets acquired in a business combination that will be re sold are valued at fair value less cost to sell 
results of operating these assets are recognized currently in the period in which those operations occur 
the company evaluates goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives not being amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
indicators at the company include  but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  a decrease in the company s market capitalization below its book value and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  the company performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if an impairment is identified  the company measures and records the amount of impairment losses 
the company performs its annual analysis on the first day of its fourth quarter 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill 
in order to do this  management applies judgment in determining its reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the company s business 
the reporting units determined by management are the centers  the network and e commerce 
the definition of the reporting units affects the company s goodwill impairment assessments 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually on the first day of the company s fourth quarter  and each of these tests indicated no impairment 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by applying a weighted average of two methods quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
the weighting is exchange market price and discounted cash flows 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate an impairment charge 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the fair value of the reporting unit allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
significant changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions  stock price  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
the market capitalization of the company s stock temporarily declined to approximately million on december   which was substantially lower than the company s estimated combined fair values of its three reporting units 
the company completed a reconciliation of the sum of the estimated fair values of its reporting units to its market value based upon its stock price at december  
we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between fair value and our market capitalization is due to a control premium 
we believe the value of a control premium is the value a market participant could extract as savings and or synergies by obtaining control  and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead costs and obtaining discounts on volume purchasing from suppliers 
the company also considers the following qualitative items that cannot be accurately quantified and are based upon the beliefs of management  but provide additional support for the explanation of the remaining difference between the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units and its market capitalization the company s stock is thinly traded  the decline in the company s stock price during is not directly correlated to a change in the overall operating performance of the company  and previously unseen pressures are in place given the global financial and economic crisis 
at december  the company s market capitalization of million exceeded the book value of its three reporting units 
we will continue to monitor market trends in our business  the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment 
should our market capitalization again decline below our book value or we have other indicators of impairment  as previously discussed  we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis  which may lead to a step two analysis resulting in a goodwill impairment 
additionally  we would then be required to review our remaining long lived assets for impairment 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of the acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with the acquired businesses is impaired 
additionally  as the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value  our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

under a a discount arrangement on products and service  b a fee for service arrangement  and c a per capita basis or capitation arrangements  which is a fixed per member per month fee received from the benefit providers 
all contracts are for one calendar year and are and cancelable with ninety days notice by either party 
under the discount arrangements  the company provides the products and services to the eligible members of a benefit provider at a pre determined discount or customary price and the member pays the company directly for the products and services 
under the fee for service arrangements  the company provides the products and services to the eligible members at its customary price less the benefit they are allowed a specific dollar amount  which the member pays directly to the company 
the company then bills the benefit provider the agreed upon benefit for the service 
under the capitation agreements  the company agrees with the benefit provider to provide their eligible members with a pre determined discount 
revenue under capitation agreements is derived from the sales of products and services to members of the plan and from a capitation fee paid to the company by the benefit provider at the beginning of each month 
the members that are purchasing products and services pay the customary price less the pre determined discount 
this revenue from the sales of products to these members is recorded at the customary price less applicable discount in the period that the product is delivered 
the direct expenses consisting primarily of the cost of goods sold and commissions on sales are recorded in the same period 
other indirect operating expenses are recorded in the period which they are incurred 
the capitation fee revenue is calculated based on the total members in the benefit provider s plan at the beginning of each month and is non refundable 
only a small percentage of these members may ever purchase product or services from the company 
the capitation fee revenue is earned as a result of agreeing to provide services to members without regard to the actual amount of service provided 
that revenue is recorded monthly in the period that the company has agreed to see any eligible members 
the company records each transaction at its customary price for the three types of arrangements  less any applicable discounts from the arrangements in the center business segment 
the products sold are recorded under the hearing aids and other products line item and the services are recorded under the service line item on the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue and expense are recorded when the product has been delivered  net of an estimate for return allowances 
revenue and expense from services and repairs are recorded when the services or repairs have been performed 
capitation revenue is recorded as revenue from hearing aids since it relates to the discount given to the members 
revenues are considered earned by the company at the time delivery of product or services have been provided to its customers when the company is entitled to the benefits of the revenues 
when the arrangements are related to members of benefit providers that are located outside the company owned centers territories  the revenues generated under these arrangements are included under the network business segment 
the company records a receivable for the amounts due from the benefit providers and a payable for the amounts owed to the affiliated providers 
the company only pays the affiliated provider when the funds are received from the benefit provider 
the company records revenue equal to the minimal fee for processing and administrative fees 
the costs associated with these services are operating costs  mostly for the labor of the network support staff and are recorded when incurred 
no contract costs are capitalized by the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts certain of the accounts receivable of the company are from health insurance and managed care organizations and government agencies 
these organizations could take up to nine months before paying a claim made by the company and also impose a limit on the time the claim can be billed 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
in order to calculate that allowance  the company first identifies any known uncollectible amounts in its accounts receivable listing and charges them against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
then a specific percent per plan and per aging categories is applied against the remaining receivables to estimate the needed allowance 
any changes in the percent assumptions per plan and aging categories results in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  an increase of in the percent applied against the remaining receivables would increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  sales returns the company provides to all patients purchasing hearing aids a specific return period of at least days  or as mandated by state guidelines if the patient is dissatisfied with the product 
the company provides an allowance in accrued expenses for returns 
the return period can be extended to days if the patient attends the company s help classes 
the company calculates its allowance for returns using estimates based upon actual historical returns 
the cost of the hearing aid is reimbursed to the company by the manufacturer 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  it is considered to be impaired and would be written down to its fair value 
currently we have not experienced any events that would indicate a potential impairment of these assets  but if circumstances change we could be required to record a loss for the impairment of long lived assets 
stock based compensation share based payments are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term  the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term and an estimate of the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
the expected term is based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on a historical volatility of our common stock for a period at least equal to the expected term 
estimated forfeitures are calculated based on historical experience 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
both the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to establish a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
although we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used  if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions  the balances of the deferred tax assets  liabilities and valuation allowance could be adversely affected
