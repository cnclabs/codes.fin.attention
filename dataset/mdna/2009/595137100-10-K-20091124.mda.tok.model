during the year ended september   we have actively taken steps to integrate the management of our various operations  including management of our recent acquisitions 
production has been transferred between our facilities to share resources and technology  as well as to more efficiently produce our products 
we strive to make the best possible use of our engineering capabilities by sharing research and production methods across our divisions and  where appropriate  assigning engineers to the same project  regardless of the facility that incurs the personnel expense 
our manufacturing management team has also been reorganized to increase efficiency 
restructuring and severance charges in  we announced the consolidation of operations in broomfield  colorado  a  square foot facility  into other microsemi facilities and recorded estimated severance payments of million 
the severance payments are related to approximately employees  including management positions 
severance payments commenced in the second quarter of fiscal year broomfield accounted for approximately  and of net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in the sales percentage related to our customers taking a larger stocking position during the transition of product lines from the broomfield facility to other microsemi facilities 
the broomfield facility ceased operations at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year  and substantially all accrued amounts are expected to be paid within twelve months 
the following table reflects the activities related to the consolidation of broomfield and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the date below amounts in thousands employee severance other related costs total balance at october  provisions cash expenditures balance at september  provisions cash expenditures balance at september  provisions cash expenditures balance at september  
table of contents during fiscal year  we recorded a held for sale impairment of million related to the real estate and building for our closed manufacturing facility in broomfield  colorado to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
in may  we announced that we will retain our manufacturing operations in ennis  ireland to meet the increasing demand for our high reliability defense and commercial air satellite products 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we reversed accruals for severance totaling million 
in fiscal year  we recorded million in severance expense incurred in integrating existing microsemi operations with powerdsine 
the severance payments cover approximately employees and substantially all payments were made by the end of fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded restructuring expenses of million in addition to broomfield closure charges 
these expenses were for severance payments of approximately million related to reductions in force and approximately million comprised of cash payments of salary and related expenses of million and non cash expenses of million related to stock awards related to the retirement of a former officer of the company 
the reductions in force impacted approximately employees  substantially all of whom were in manufacturing departments at our various facilities 
we generally offer severance benefits  including pay continuation and continued health coverage for a limited period of time based on an employee s length of service 
we expect that accrued balances will be paid out within the next twelve months 
the following table reflects the restructuring activities and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance balance at september  provisions cash expenditures other non cash settlement balance at september  in fiscal year  we recorded restructuring expenses of million related to severance from reductions in force at our various facilities  in addition to broomfield and scottsdale closure charges 
these restructuring activities covered approximately individuals in manufacturing  engineering and sales 
in connection with the fiscal year restructuring items  we incurred an impairment charge of million related to the retirement of manufacturing fixed assets that will be disposed 
expense related to this impairment charge was recorded in cost of goods sold 
the following table reflects the restructuring activities and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance balance at september  provisions cash expenditures other non cash settlement balance at september  in fiscal year  we approved consolidation plans that will result in the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona by april in fiscal year  the company recorded charges for severance 
table of contents and asset write downs related to the scottsdale closure that included severance charges of million that are expected to be paid beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year and extending through and a held and used impairment of million to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
in addition  we recorded a write down of million for additional inventory obsolescence write downs to cost of goods sold for estimated inventory components that will not be used by the anticipated closure date and that cannot be used by other manufacturing facilities 
we anticipate that we will incur additional future restructuring charges related to the scottsdale closure for lease termination and facility remediation costs estimated to be approximately million 
these costs are expected to be incurred through fiscal year the consolidation of scottsdale is expected to result  subsequent to its completion  in annual cost savings of between million to million from the elimination of redundant resources and related expenses and employee reductions 
scottsdale has approximately employees and occupies a  square foot leased facility 
scottsdale shipped approximately  and of net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
acquisitions and divestiture in fiscal year  we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with powerdsine ltd 
powerdsine  an israeli corporation  and pinnacle acquisition corporation  ltd  an israeli corporation that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of microsemi 
the merger agreement provided for a merger of our subsidiary into powerdsine 
we completed the acquisition of powerdsine in fiscal year and under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued of a share of microsemi common stock and paid in cash for each powerdsine ordinary share  resulting in the issuance in the aggregate of approximately million shares with a fair market value of approximately million  based on microsemi s average closing price between october  and october  and a cash payment of approximately million 
we converted equity awards issued by powerdsine and valued vested awards at million 
direct transaction fees and expenses were million and an additional million was placed into escrow for the cash consideration on converted unvested powerdsine restricted share awards 
this amount will be paid to employees as their restricted share awards vest 
an additional million in transaction costs were accrued by powerdsine prior to the acquisition and subsequently paid by microsemi 
we financed this transaction with cash on hand and through additional borrowings of approximately million on our credit line 
during fiscal year  we acquired substantially all the assets of microwave device technology corporation and all the common stock of tsi microelectronics corporation for million in cash  net of cash acquired 
we also acquired substantially all the assets of semicoa for million  including million in cash consideration to semicoa and certain creditors  the assumption of million in liabilities  million related to a lease agreement with a party related to semicoa shareholders and million in transaction fees and expenses 
we funded these acquisitions with cash on hand 
during fiscal year  we entered into a stock purchase agreement in which we acquired all the shares of electro module  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  babcock  inc for million  net of cash acquired 
babcock  inc is a leading manufacturer of high reliability power supplies  relays and flat panel displays and supplies 
we subsequently renamed babcock  inc  microsemi corp 
power management group pmg 
also during fiscal year  we entered into an asset purchase agreement in which we acquired substantially all the assets of the defense and security business of endwave corporation for million 
the defense and security business designs  manufactures and markets radio frequency modules that enable the transmission  reception and processing of high frequency signals 
markets for these products include defense electronics  homeland security systems and other applications that require high frequency radio frequency circuitry and subsystems 
our final acquisition fiscal year  was of nexsem  inc in which we entered into an asset 
table of contents purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of its assets for million 
nexsem  inc is a designer and marketer of high voltage dc to dc conversion devices for applications such as in lcd televisions  set top boxes  notebooks and netbooks 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and in connection with a settlement with the united states department of justice  we entered into an agreement which  in substance  resulted in the divestiture of the assets purchased from semicoa 
proceeds from this transaction totaled million  of which million was deposited with an escrow agent to be released one year subsequent to the transaction date 
we sold accounts receivable  inventories  equipment  and intangible assets with net book values of million  million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we reduced goodwill by million for the pro rata amount of goodwill allocable to the sale of semicoa assets 
the pro rata portion of goodwill adjusted for the disposition was based on the ratio of the relative fair value of the disposed business compared to the total fair value of our reporting unit on the transaction date 
direct transaction expenses related to the sale amounted to million 
in the aggregate  the pre tax income  net assets acquired and divested and consideration paid and received related to the acquisitions and disposition consummated in fiscal years and did not meet the minimum thresholds for reporting historical results on a pro forma basis 
historical results on a pro forma basis are included in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the acquisition consummated in fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained herein 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amount shown in the balance sheet are trade accounts receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on our historical write off experience 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
with the exception of one distributor who entered into bankruptcy and for whom we charged off approximately million against the allowance for doubtful accounts in fiscal year  actual bad debt has been within our expectations and the provisions established  and has been consistent with experience of prior years 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
additionally  inventory reserves are established based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
historically  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
investment in available for sale securities we invest cash balances in excess of projected liquidity needs primarily in money market funds and auction rate securities 
all of our investments to date have maintained triple a ratings  however  current credit market disruptions  particularly related to auction rate securities  may adversely affect the ratings of our investments 
at september   our investment in auction rate securities consisted of auction rate bonds whose principal and interest are federally guaranteed by the family federal education loan program 
we previously had a practice of investing in auction rate securities and selling the securities prior to our interim and year end reporting periods 
we purchased the auction rate securities held at september  in january and experienced auction failures in mid february that have impacted the liquidity of our investment in auction rate securities 
auction failures do not represent a default of the security 
we have entered into a settlement agreement with the financial institution where we hold our investment in auction rate securities and  per the terms of the settlement agreement a on november   the financial institution repurchased our million investment in auction rate preferred shares at par plus accrued interest  b we hold rights to sell our million investment in auction rate bonds back to the financial institution at par plus accrued interest beginning june  through july  ars rights  and c we are permitted to borrow at no net cost the full par value of our investment in auction rate bonds 
during the quarter ended march   we monetized all auction rate securities at full par value of million via the no net cost auction rate securities credit facility  which resulted in an increase of million in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and a corresponding increase in borrowing under our auction rate securities credit facility 
the credit facility  which is maintained by a subsidiary of the financial institution where we hold our investment in auction rate securities  is collateralized by any balances held in a collateral account at the subsidiary 
the only balances held in the collateral account since the settlement date are the auction rate securities 
the outstanding amounts under the credit facility may become due and payable upon demand  provided that the parent financial institution is required  either itself or through an affiliate  to provide alternative financing on substantially the same terms as soon as reasonably possible 
while the financial institution may repurchase our investment in auction rate securities prior to june   we intend to put these auction rate securities back to the financial institution and use the proceeds to repay the credit facility when permitted by the ars rights 
as such  at september   we have classified both the investment in auction rate securities and auction rate securities credit facility as current 
subsequent to september  an issuer called million in auction rate bonds at par plus accrued interest 
as such  our remaining investment in auction rate securities and the corresponding auction rate securities credit facility were each million 
for our investment in auction rate securities  we evaluated counterparty risk with regards to the settlement agreement and concluded  as of september   that non performance risk was nominal 
at september   we concluded that any other than temporary impairment in the fair value of our auction rate securities would be offset substantially by the fair value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement 
as such  the investment in auction rate securities and the fair value of the auction rate securities settlement agreement are recorded at million  the par value of the auction rate bonds 

table of contents we classify assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that an entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data for the asset or liability at the measurement date  and level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data used when there is minimal market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
we elected to measure the fair value of the auction rate securities settlement agreement at fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents are classified as level  and our investment in auction rate securities and the fair value of the settlement agreement are classified as level for our investment in auction rate securities  we evaluated counterparty risk with regards to the settlement agreement and concluded  as of september   that non performance risk was nominal 
at september   we concluded that any other than temporary impairment in the fair value of our auction rate securities would be offset substantially by the fair value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement 
as such  the investment in auction rate securities and the fair value of the auction rate securities settlement agreement are recorded at million  the par value of the auction rate bonds 
however  given that there is currently no active secondary market for our investment in auction rate securities  the determination of fair market value in the future could be negatively impacted by many factors including but not limited to  failure of the financial institution to meet its obligations under the settlement agreement  continuing illiquidity in the market for auction rate securities for an extended period of time  a lack of action by the issuers to establish different forms of financing to replace or redeem these securities  changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities and changes in market interest rates above contractual maximum interest rates on the underlying auction rate securities 
should credit market disruptions continue or increase in magnitude or if our assessment of the counterparty risk indicates an increased potential for non performance  we may be required to record an impairment on our investments or consider that an ultimate liquidity event may take longer than currently anticipated 
we currently do not anticipate an impairment of our investments that would not be substantially offset by the fair value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement  however  if we had to record any impairment  for every decline in principal  a decrease in value of approximately million would occur 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  investment in marketable securities  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  notes payable and certain other current assets approximate their fair values because of their short maturity or ability for us to convert them into cash 
the carrying value of our long term liabilities at september  and september  approximates fair value based upon the current rate offered to us for obligations of the same remaining maturities 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at lower of cost or realizable values 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 

table of contents we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets within the asset group over their fair value is recorded 
the appropriate asset group is determined based on the lowest level of largely independent cash inflows and outflows for the related assets 
depending on the nature of the primary assets in the asset group  fair value is estimated using one of several approaches including replacement cost  appraised values  market quotes or estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
during fiscal year  we recorded a held for sale impairment of million related to the real estate and building for our closed manufacturing facility in broomfield  colorado and a held and used impairment of million for the anticipated closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill on an impairment only approach and amortize intangible assets with known useful lives over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings  which equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its then fair value  and a reduction in goodwill on our balance sheet 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
we perform our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we primarily recognize revenue to customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors  and these contracts may permit very limited stock rotation returns 
we provide an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenue have been within management s expectations 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from fixed price contracts 
revenue for these contracts are recorded under a percentage of completion method  which is based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to estimated total costs at completion 
gross profit expected to be realized on fixed price contracts are based on periodic 
table of contents estimates of total revenues and costs for each contract 
losses on contracts are accrued when estimated total costs exceed total revenues 
occasionally  we will enter into contracts on a cost plus fee basis 
we recognize revenue based on reimbursements for actual expenses plus the contractually agreed upon fee with the customer 
restructuring charges we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded and can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions and elimination of excess facilities 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability exists  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their expected termination dates and expected severance payments or when formal severance plans exist  when the severance payments are probable and reasonably estimable 
the elimination of excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees  future contractual commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated sublease income  facility remediation costs and moving costs to remove property and equipment from the facilities 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises or ceased use of the facility 
research and development we expense the cost of research and development as incurred 
research and development expenses principally comprise payroll and related costs  supplies  and the cost of prototypes 
in process research and development ipr d represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technologies that  as of the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
stock based compensation compensation expense for stock options was calculated based on the date of grant or conversion using the black scholes option pricing model with exercise prices equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
restricted stock awards were granted to employees with compensation expense determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock options and restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if length of service requirements are unmet 
expected life was estimated based on historical exercise data that was stratified between members of the board of directors  executive employees and all other recipients 
expected volatility was estimated based on historical volatility using equally weighted daily price observations over a period approximately equal to the expected life of each option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury securities with an equivalent remaining term 
no dividends are expected to be paid 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize uncertain tax positions when they meet a more likely than not threshold 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit within operations as income tax expense 

table of contents we file us federal  state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by tax authorities 
each quarter  we reassess our uncertain tax positions for any additions  deletions due to statute of limitation expiration  interest and penalties 
results of operations for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year net sales decreased million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for fiscal year and fiscal year is approximately as follows amounts in thousands commercial air satellite defense industrial semicap medical mobile connectivity notebook lcd tv display net sales in the commercial air satellite end market increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year net sales have maintained relative stability though the overall commercial air market was negatively impacted by the slowing global economy 
our sales into the refurbishment market have also been negatively impacted as existing aircraft have been temporarily removed from active service due to lower travel demand 
the increase in net sales between fiscal year and fiscal year was driven primarily by demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  growing electronic content in current aircraft  refurbishment programs for older aircraft and demand for the high reliability radar and avionics solutions we provide 
sales into satellite applications remain stable as generally these applications are in a less economically sensitive market 
rates of air traffic decline have slowed and financing conditions appear to have improved  and as such  we expect that net sales in this end market will remain stable next quarter 
net sales in the defense end market increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year net sales in both periods have maintained relative stability 
we expect that appropriations in the united states and allied nations for defense electronics will increase and that net sales in this end market will remain stable next quarter 
net sales in the industrial semicap market decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year during fiscal year  semiconductor companies substantially reduced their capital expenditures in response to the economic climate which negatively impacted this end market 
visibility remains limited though some customers in this end market expect a more favorable economic environment and have requested that we accelerate delivery of orders 
as such  we expect that net sales in this end market will grow slightly in the next quarter 
net sales in the medical end market decreased million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year increasing functionality and device integration in implantable medical devices  such as defibrillators and pacemakers  have resulted in increases in both dollars per unit and unit content per device 
the implantable market continues to show substantive growth and benefit from new product launches 
in fiscal year fiscal year  net sales benefited from our support of a product launch schedule of a principal implantable device customer 
the growth in implantable medical devices was tempered by slowing sales into 
table of contents mri applications 
as a result of the economic climate over the previous year  capital purchases of mri equipment have declined 
while we expect that our overall dollar content in medical applications will grow  especially in implantable medical devices  visibility remains limited in mri applications 
overall  we expect that net sales in this end market will remain stable next quarter 
net sales in the mobile connectivity end market decreased million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in fiscal year  enterprise demand waned in a challenging economic environment  resulting in net sales declines 
as economic conditions have improved  net sales increased sequentially in the most recent quarter and while visibility remains fairly limited  we believe this end market is showing some signs of stabilization and that net sales in this end market will increase modestly in the next quarter 
net sales in the notebook lcd television display end market decreased million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this end market has been negatively impacted by the effects of the economic slowdown  with the main decreases occurring in parts for automotive navigation systems and notebook storage products 
while net sales in fiscal year declined as compared to fiscal year  we see excellent long term prospects for our lighting products in both ccfl and led driven technologies 
we continued to introduce new products in this end market with the goal of increasing our market share in the emerging less than inch television market and the netbook pc market 
net sales increased sequentially in the most recent quarter and while visibility remains fairly limited  given our new product offerings  we expect that net sales in this end market will increase modestly in the next quarter 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for fiscal year and fiscal year was approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states europe asia total between fiscal year and fiscal year  net sales originating from the united states and asia decreased million and million  respectively  and net sales originating from europe increased million 
net sales originating from asia decreased primarily due to a decrease in net sales of products  primarily in the mobile connectivity and notebook lcd tv display end markets  shipped from our facilities and subcontractors in asia 
gross profit decreased million  to million of sales for from million of sales for the decrease in gross profit was due to lower sales 
in fiscal year  gross profit percentage was impacted basis points due primarily to inventory write downs related to product lines that do not meet gross margin targets  products that are being migrated to newer generations  products that service large capital spending end markets for which demand has declined and inventory at our scottsdale  arizona facility that we announced we are closing 
the remaining decline in gross profit percentage was due substantially to the effects of fixed costs allocated over lower sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase related to a million in higher stock based compensation and million in higher legal expenses  offset by the effects of recent restructuring and cost control measures 
research and development expense decreased million to million in from million in  primarily due to the effects of recent restructuring and cost control measures 
the principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the 
table of contents growth of our businesses 
the spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher margin application specific products  including  among others  poe  ccfl and led drivers  class d audio amplifiers  ingap rf power amplifiers for wireless lan applications  development and adoption of silicon carbide technology  vdmos products for high frequency communications and s band products for rf applications 
we incurred in process research and development ipr d charges of million from the nexsem acquisition in fiscal year and million from the microwave device technology corporation acquisition in fiscal year restructuring charges amount to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year restructuring costs in fiscal year consisted of in severance and in other related costs 
the increase for was principally the result of additional restructuring actions taken in  including the anticipated closure of the scottsdale manufacturing facility 
we anticipate that we will incur additional future restructuring charges related to the scottsdale closure for lease termination and facility remediation costs estimated to be approximately million 
these costs are expected to be incurred through fiscal year impairment charges related to facility closures represented the held for sale impairment for the building and real estate related to our closed broomfield  colorado facility amounting to million and the held and used impairment for our scottsdale manufacturing facility amounting to million to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
interest income decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million against a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year compared to a provision for income taxes of million against a pre tax income of million in fiscal year our worldwide operating strategy has resulted in better corporate wide efficiency and profitability  however  it also resulted in cumulative operating losses over the last several years for our us operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefits of certain us deferred tax assets will not be realized 
key positive and negative evidence we considered in making this determination included recent history of cumulative operating losses for our us operations  future estimates of operating results for our us operations  and our ability to carryback our us operating losses  tax credits and reversing temporary differences to recover previously paid taxes 
based on this assessment  we determined that a valuation allowance was required for the deferred tax assets related to our us operations that could not be carried back to recover previously paid taxes 
accordingly  we recorded a million valuation allowance on a substantial portion of our us deferred tax assets  which is included in the total tax provision of million 
without this valuation allowance  we would have reported a tax benefits of approximately million due to higher tax benefits in the jurisdictions with losses than tax expenses in the jurisdictions with income 
we may be required to record additional valuation allowances in the future if our estimate on reversing temporary differences differs from the actual amounts reversed 

table of contents results of operations for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year net sales increased million or to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for fiscal year and fiscal year is approximately as follows amounts in thousands commercial air satellite defense industrial semicap medical mobile connectivity notebook lcd tv display net sales in the commercial air satellite end market increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily driven by demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  as well as growing electronic content in current aircraft 
net sales in the defense end market increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year net sales in this end market continued to be solid with high historical demand  increasing electronic content in defense equipment and continued funding of new programs 
net sales in the industrial semicap market decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  with the decrease primarily attributable to a decrease in sales for use in semicap applications 
net sales in our fiscal fourth quarter grew modestly  due to higher sales of industrial applications 
net sales in the medical end market increased million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year increasing functionality and device integration in implantable medical devices  such as defibrillators and pacemakers  have resulted in increases in both dollars per unit and unit content per device 
net sales in the mobile connectivity end market increased million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year net sales in this end market have grown due primarily to the addition of contributions from powerdsine  which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal year net sales in the notebook lcd television display end market increased million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  we gained market share in our lcd tv business for ccfl with notable design win strength with tier customers in japan and korea 
we also saw strong interest in our next generation backlighting solutions and notebook design wins 
lcd tv remains the largest component of this end market and leading lcd tv manufacturers and panel suppliers noted slowing demand at the end of fiscal year we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for fiscal year and fiscal year was approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states europe asia total 
table of contents between fiscal years and  net sales originating from the united states decreased million while net sales originating from europe and asia increased million and million  respectively 
this shift in originating geographic area was due primarily to our decision to shift the fulfillment of some customer orders directly from our locations in europe and asia rather than through our locations in the united states 
net sales originating in asia also increased due to the contributions of powerdsine  ltd  which we acquired in the second quarter of gross profit increased million  to million of sales for fiscal year from million of sales for fiscal year the increase in gross profit was due to higher sales 
gross profit percentage increased primarily due to progress in our facility rationalization  which has reallocated production  particularly to our ireland manufacturing facility  based on manufacturing costs  efficiencies and capabilities at each of our facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the changes were an million increase in stock based compensation and a million increase primarily related to higher selling costs to support increased sales 
research and development expense increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  primarily due to the addition of research and development expense incurred at powerdsine 
the principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the growth of our businesses 
the spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher margin application specific products  including  among others  poe  ccfl and led drivers  class d audio amplifiers  ingap rf power amplifiers for wireless lan applications  development and adoption of silicon carbide technology  vdmos products for high frequency communications and s band products for rf applications 
we incurred charges for in process research and development ipr d of million in fiscal year related to our acquisition of microwave device technology corporation  a million charge from the powerdsine acquisition in fiscal year and million charge from the ppg acquisition in ipr d represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technologies that  as of the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility  and was thus immediately expensed 
the ipr d projects associated with the powerdsine acquisition were valued through the application of discounted cash flow analyses  taking into account key characteristics of each technology including its future prospects  the rate of technological change in the industry  product life cycles  risks specific to the project  and the project s stage of completion 
stage of completion was estimated by considering the time  cost  and complexity of tasks completed prior to the acquisition  versus the project s overall expected cost  effort and risks required for achieving technological feasibility 
in the application of the discounted cash flow analyses  powerdsine s management provided a revenue forecast for each ipr d project 
the projection was based on the expected date of market introduction  an assessment of customer needs  the expected pricing and cost structure of the related products  product life cycles  and the importance of existing technology relative to the in process technology 
in addition  the costs expected to complete the project were added to the operating expenses to calculate the operating income for each ipr d project 
as certain other assets contribute to the cash flow attributable to the assets being valued  returns to these other assets were calculated and deducted from the pre tax operating income to isolate the economic benefit solely attributable to each of the in process technologies 
the present value of ipr d was calculated based on discount rates recommended by the american institute of certified public accountants ipr d practice aid  which depends on the stage of completion and the additional risk associated with the completion of the ipr d project 
the earnings associated with the incomplete technologies were discounted at a rate of  two percentage points higher than the powerdsine s cost of capital 

table of contents interest expense was million lower in fiscal year versus fiscal year in fiscal year  we incurred interest expense on borrowings from our credit facility for temporary funding of the powerdsine acquisition 
interest income was million lower in fiscal year versus fiscal year primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal year and in fiscal year  with the fiscal year rate affected by the non deductibility of acquisition related charges such as in process research and development and other transactions related to the powerdsine acquisition 
these charges affected the fiscal year income tax rate by percentage points 
the fiscal year effective tax rate was impacted by a shift of income earned to lower tax rate jurisdictions 
capital resources and liquidity we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents at september  and september   respectively 
during fiscal year  we financed our operations with cash generated from operations 
during fiscal year  we entered into a stock purchase agreement in which we acquired all the shares of electro module  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  babcock  inc for million in cash  net of cash acquired 
we also purchased substantially all the assets of the defense and security business of endwave corporation and nexsem  inc for million and million  respectively  in cash and assumption of certain specified liabilities 
we financed these purchases using our cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was due mainly to increased non cash items included in net income loss and positive changes in working capital accounts offset by lower net income and the net change in other long term liability 
the net change in other long term liabilities related primarily to liabilities established for uncertain tax positions in fiscal year a summary of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year and are as follows amounts in thousands net income loss depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts loss on disposition of assets impairment related to facility closures in process research and development deferred income taxes valuation allowance on deferred income taxes stock based compensation net change in working capital accounts net change in other long term liabilities net cash provided by operating activities accounts receivable decreased million to million at september  from million at september  the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower sales in fourth quarter of fiscal year versus the fourth quarter of fiscal year but also benefited from increased collection efforts 
inventories decreased million to million at september  from million at september   with the decrease due to inventory write downs of million and efforts to reduce inventory levels in response to lower sales and improved inventory management 

table of contents other current assets increased million to million at september  from million at september  this increase was due substantially to an increase in prepaid income taxes and expected income tax refunds 
current liabilities increased million to million at september  from million at september  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reclassified million related to our auction rate securities credit facility from long term to current liabilities as we intend to put our investment in auction rate securities back to the financial institution where we have these securities and use the proceeds to repay the credit facility on june   the first date permitted by the ars rights 
this increase was offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million related primarily to lower purchases of inventory 
we invest cash balances in excess of projected liquidity needs primarily in money market funds and auction rate securities 
all of our investments to date have maintained triple a ratings  however  current credit market disruptions  particularly related to auction rate securities  may adversely affect the ratings of our investments 
at september   our investment in auction rate securities consisted of auction rate bonds whose principal and interest are federally guaranteed by the family federal education loan program 
we previously had a practice of investing in auction rate securities and selling the securities prior to our interim and year end reporting periods 
we purchased the auction rate securities held at september  in january and experienced auction failures in mid february that have impacted the liquidity of our investment in auction rate securities 
auction failures do not represent a default of the security 
we have entered into a settlement agreement with the financial institution where we hold our investment in auction rate securities and  per the terms of the settlement agreement a on november   the financial institution repurchased our million investment in auction rate preferred shares at par plus accrued interest  b we hold rights to sell our million investment in auction rate bonds back to the financial institution at par plus accrued interest beginning june  through july  ars rights  and c we are permitted to borrow at no net cost the full par value of our investment in auction rate bonds 
during the quarter ended march   we monetized all auction rate securities at full par value of million via the no net cost auction rate securities credit facility  which resulted in an increase of million in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and a corresponding increase in borrowing under our auction rate securities credit facility 
the credit facility  which is maintained by a subsidiary of the financial institution where we hold our investment in auction rate securities  is collateralized by any balances held in a collateral account at the subsidiary 
the only balances held in the collateral account since the settlement date are the auction rate securities 
the outstanding amounts under the credit facility may become due and payable upon demand  provided that the parent financial institution is required  either itself or through an affiliate  to provide alternative financing on substantially the same terms as soon as reasonably possible 
while the financial institution may repurchase our investment in auction rate securities prior to june   we intend to put these auction rate securities back to the financial institution and use the proceeds to repay the credit facility when permitted by the ars rights 
as such  at ended september   we have classified both the investment in auction rate securities and auction rate securities credit facility as current 
for our investment in auction rate securities  we evaluated counterparty risk with regards to the settlement agreement and concluded  as of september   that non performance risk was nominal 
at september   we concluded that any other than temporary impairment in the fair value of our auction rate securities would be offset substantially by the fair value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement 
as such  the investment in auction rate securities and the fair value of the auction rate securities settlement agreement are recorded at million  the par value of the auction rate bonds 
we classify assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that an entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by 
table of contents market data for the asset or liability at the measurement date  and level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data used when there is minimal market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
we elected to measure the fair value of the auction rate securities settlement agreement at fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents are classified as level  and our investment in auction rate securities and the fair value of the settlement agreement are classified as level for our investment in auction rate securities  we evaluated counterparty risk with regards to the settlement agreement and concluded  as of september   that non performance risk was nominal 
at september   we concluded that any other than temporary impairment in the fair value of our auction rate securities would be offset substantially by the fair value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement 
as such  the investment in auction rate securities and the fair value of the auction rate securities settlement agreement are recorded at million  the par value of the auction rate bonds 
however  given that there is currently no active secondary market for our investment in auction rate securities  the determination of fair market value in the future could be negatively impacted by many factors including but not limited to  failure of the financial institution to meet its obligations under the settlement agreement  continuing illiquidity in the market for auction rate securities for an extended period of time  a lack of action by the issuers to establish different forms of financing to replace or redeem these securities  changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities and changes in market interest rates above contractual maximum interest rates on the underlying auction rate securities 
should credit market disruptions continue or increase in magnitude or if our assessment of the counterparty risk indicates an increased potential for non performance  we may be required to record an impairment on our investments or consider that an ultimate liquidity event may take longer than currently anticipated 
we currently do not anticipate an impairment of our investments that would not be substantially offset by the fair value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement  however  if we had to record any impairment  for every decline in principal  a decrease in value of approximately million would occur 
subsequent to september  an issuer called million in auction rate bonds at par plus accrued interest 
as such  our remaining investment in auction rate securities and the corresponding auction rate securities credit facility were each million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for and million for  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year primarily consisted of million in net cash consideration for three acquisitions  purchase of property and equipment of million  partially offset by million from the sale of investments in available for sale securities  million in net proceeds from the divesture of assets related to the semicoa business and changes in other assets of million

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and million in excess tax benefits from stock awards 
we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of december  with a stated maturity date of january  with comerica bank the revolving credit agreement with maximum available borrowing amounts set at million  million and million in the agreement s first  second and third years  respectively 
as of september   we were in compliance with the financial covenants required 
table of contents by the revolving credit agreement 
as of september   we were in the third year of the agreement  there were no borrowings outstanding against the revolving credit agreement  million was outstanding in the form of a letter of credit  and million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit agreement 
on october   we terminated the revolving credit agreement and on october   we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na the new credit facility 
the new credit facility is scheduled to mature on october  the new credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million the maximum commitment 
the new credit facility is available for direct borrowings and  subject to the maximum commitment  up to million of the new credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings under the new credit facility may be used for working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 
the company has no direct borrowings and  in letters of credit outstanding under the new credit facility 
interest accruing on the amount of direct borrowings under the new credit facility is determined based upon the company s choice of either a base rate loan or a eurodollar rate loan 
the interest rate per annum for base rate loans is determined by reference to the higher of the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate as announced by bank of america  na and a libor rate determined as provided in the new credit facility plus  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for base rate loans is initially per annum but may decrease to or increase to based upon a leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as each such term in defined in the new credit facility 
eurodollar rate loans bear interest at the eurodollar rate defined in the new credit facility  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans is initially per annum but may decrease to or increase to based upon a leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
in addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility  the company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the applicable commitment fee rate multiplied by the actual daily amount by which the maximum commitment exceeds the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans and all letter of credit obligations under the new credit facility 
the commitment fee rate is initially per annum but may decrease to based upon a leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
the company is also required to pay a quarterly letter of credit fee for each letter of credit based on the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under the letter of credit multiplied by the letter of credit fee rate 
the letter of credit fee rate is initially per annum but may decrease to or increase to based upon a leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
the new credit facility requires the company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the new credit facility of not less than  and a consolidated liquidity ratio as defined in the new credit facility of not less than 
the new credit facility also contains customary limitations on the company s and its subsidiaries ability to incur liens or indebtedness  make investments or certain restricted payments  merge with or acquire other companies  liquidate or dissolve  dispose of assets  substantially change the nature of the company s business  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the new credit facility  the lender may cease making loans  terminate the new credit facility  and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
the new credit facility specifies a number of events of default some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods  including  among other things  non payment of principal and interest when due  failure to satisfy the covenants in the new credit facility  including the financial covenants described above  default of certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy or insolvency and a change of control 
as of september   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
based upon information currently available to us  we believe that we can meet our cash requirements and capital commitments in the foreseeable future with cash balances  internally generated funds from ongoing operations and  if necessary  from the available line of credit 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments  excluding liability related to uncertain tax positions  at september  amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years imputed interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total as of september   we recorded million in long term liabilities for accrued taxes related to uncertain tax positions and are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the liability related to uncertain tax positions has not been included in the contractual obligations table 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements

additional authoritative guidance issued in october and april provided additional guidance on determining fair value in an inactive market and when volume and level of activity have significantly decreased 
the adoption of the authoritative guidance  excluding authoritative guidance related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  did not result in a material impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in addition  a useful life should be assigned that reflects the acquiring entity s consumption of the defensive asset s expected benefits 
this authoritative guidance will be applied prospectively for intangible assets acquired on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this authoritative guidance  but the potential impact is dependent on the specific terms of any potential future business combinations or acquisitions

table of contents in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 which provides clarification for measuring fair value when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
asu no 
also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability

asu no 
provides a hierarchy for estimating the selling price for each of the deliverables 
asu no 
eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price
