item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leader in decision management dm solutions that enable businesses to automate  improve and connect decisions to enhance business performance 
our predictive analytics  which include the industry standard fico score  and our decision management systems power billions of customer 
table of contents decisions each year 
we help companies acquire customers more efficiently  increase customer value  reduce fraud and credit losses  lower operating expenses and enter new markets more profitably 
most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions  as do many insurers  retailers  healthcare organizations  pharmaceutical companies and government agencies 
we also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their fico scores  the standard measure in the united states of credit risk  empowering them to manage their financial health 
most of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the consumer credit  banking and insurance industries  and during the year ended september   of our revenues were derived from within these industries 
a significant portion of our remaining revenues is derived from the healthcare and retail industries 
our clients utilize our products and services to facilitate a variety of business processes  including customer marketing and acquisition  account origination  credit and underwriting risk management  fraud loss prevention and control  and client account and policyholder management 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from transactional or unit based software license fees  annual license fees under long term software license arrangements  transactional fees derived under scoring  network service or internal hosted software arrangements  and annual software maintenance fees 
the recurrence of these revenues is  to a significant degree  dependent upon our clients continued usage of our products and services in their business activities 
the more significant activities underlying the use of our products in these areas include credit and debit card usage or active account levels  lending acquisition  origination and customer management activity  and customer acquisition  cross selling and retention programs 
approximately of our revenues during fiscal were derived from arrangements with transactional or unit based pricing 
we also derive revenues from other sources which generally do not recur and include  but are not limited to  perpetual or time based licenses with upfront payment terms  non recurring professional service arrangements and gain share arrangements where revenue is derived based on percentages of client revenue growth or cost reductions attributable to our products 
one measure used by management as an indicator of our business performance is the volume of bookings achieved 
we define a booking as estimated future contractual revenues  including agreements with perpetual  multi year and annual terms 
bookings values may include i estimates of variable fee components such as hours to be incurred under new professional services arrangements and customer account or transaction activity for agreements with transactional based fee arrangements  ii additional or expanded business from renewals of contracts  and iii to a lesser extent  previous customers that have attrited and been resold only as a result of a significant sales effort 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we achieved bookings of million  including five deals with bookings values of million or more 
in comparison  bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  including two deals with bookings values of million or more 
management regards the volume of bookings achieved  among other factors  as an important indicator of future revenues  but they are not comparable to  nor should they be substituted for  an analysis of our revenues  and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those described in item a risk factors  concerning timing and contingencies affecting product delivery and performance 
although many of our contracts have fixed noncancelable terms  some of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice 
accordingly  we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize all of our bookings as backlog that will generate future revenue 
our revenues derived from clients outside the united states have generally grown  and may in the future grow  more rapidly than our revenues from domestic clients 
international revenues totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing   and of total consolidated revenues in each of these years 
revenues declined million for the year ended september   from the prior fiscal year  due to unfavorable currency translation 
we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from international clients will increase in the future  subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents reengineering initiative in april  we announced the details of an ongoing reengineering initiative designed to grow revenues through strategic resource allocation and improve profitability through cost reduction 
key components of the initiative included rationalizing the business portfolio  simplifying management hierarchy  eliminating low priority positions  consolidating facilities and managing fixed and variable costs 
also in connection with the initiative  we sold our insurance bill review business unit and our liquidcredit service for telecom lct and roamex product line assets  and we fully exited our cortronics neural research product line  fast panel diagnostics product line and advertising services group 
in january of  we completed additional actions under our reengineering initiative 
the additional actions were aimed at reducing costs through headcount reductions and facility consolidations 
with respect to headcount reductions  we identified and eliminated positions throughout the company for an expected annual cost savings of approximately million 
in addition  we incurred charges of million related to the exit of certain leases and a million charge due to unfavorable sublease arrangements we entered into for office space previously vacated 
current business environment throughout fiscal  financial markets continued to experience significant volatility and general economic conditions remained unstable 
these conditions have had a substantial impact on our customers  especially financial institutions 
this has included continued consolidations among our customers  a significant decline in new account acquisition activities and extension of credit by financial institutions and a general slowing of software purchases and related implementation services by our customers 
these unfavorable conditions have affected our business in and are expected to continue to affect us through most of fiscal our annual impairment testing of goodwill indicated that all of our reporting segment s fair values exceeded their respective recorded values 
worsening economic conditions have negatively impacted the estimates used in our july  annual goodwill impairment testing  and in particular  for our strategy machine solutions segment  which has million in goodwill 
if difficult market and economic conditions continue and cause revenues to decline more quickly than we can reduce costs  our margins will decrease and we may experience a further decline in the fair value of our reporting units 
such further declines in fair value may require us to record an impairment charge related to goodwill 
as a result of this difficult business environment  we will continue to aggressively manage our expenses in an effort to maintain solid earnings and cash flows 
we also plan to continue to invest in our decision management solutions as well as our core business operations 
acquisition and divestiture activity in june  we signed definitive agreements to sell the assets associated with our liquidcredit for telecom lct and roamex product lines for million in cash

the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including maintenance of consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the credit facility also contains covenants typical of unsecured facilities 
as of september   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at an average interest rate of 
senior notes in may  we issued million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors 
the senior notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from to years 
the senior notes weighted average interest rate is and the weighted average maturity is years 
the senior notes are subject to certain restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to those in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility including maintenance of consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the purchase agreement for the senior notes also includes covenants typical of unsecured facilities 
capital resources and liquidity outlook as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable security investments 
we believe that these balances  as well as available borrowings from our million revolving credit facility and anticipated cash flows from operating activities  will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements and scheduled repayments of existing debt over the course of the next twelve months 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources  including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at september  fiscal year thereafter total in thousands senior notes revolving line of credit interest due on debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total commitments million represents the unpaid principal amount of our senior notes issued in may the senior notes were issued in four series in a private placement to a group of institutional investors 
interest due on debt obligations represents interest payments on our senior notes and revolving line of credit 
based on the terms of our revolving credit facility see note  interest paid is based on variable rates applied to outstanding principal 
borrowings and rates will vary during the term of the credit facility  which has a maturity date of october  as a result  future interest payments are difficult to estimate 
accordingly  interest obligations shown in the table were estimated using a rate of  which was the rate in effect on borrowings outstanding at september  represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable  legally binding and specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the payments 
unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  the related balances have not been reflected in the section of the table showing payment by fiscal year 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred at our customer s location  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately by us and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
the determination of whether fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable involves the use of assumptions 
we evaluate contract terms and customer information to ensure that these criteria are met prior to our recognition of license fee revenue 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and change to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
when software licenses are sold together with implementation or consulting services  license fees are recognized upon delivery provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization or modification of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized using contract accounting as described below 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance  expiration of the acceptance period  or when we can demonstrate we meet the acceptance criteria 
revenues from post contract customer support services  such as software maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
the majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period 
revenues recognized from our credit scoring  data processing  data management and internet delivery services are recognized as these services are performed  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the determination of certain of our credit scoring and data processing revenues requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information  if available  or based on average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate transaction volumes in the future  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data was received  and this could have a material impact on our results of operations during the period of time that we changed accounting methods 

table of contents transactional or unit based license fees under software license arrangements  network service and internally hosted software agreements are recognized as revenue based on system usage or when fees based on system usage exceed monthly minimum license fees  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
the determination of certain of our transactional or unit based license fee revenues requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction usage or active account volumes in instances where this information is reported to us by our clients on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information  if available  or based on average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate customer account or transaction volumes in the future  revenue would be deferred until actual customer data was received  and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we provide consulting  training  model development and software integration services under both hourly based time and materials and fixed priced contracts 
revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
for fixed price service contracts  we apply the percentage of completion method of contract accounting to determine progress towards completion  which requires the use of estimates 
in such instances  management is required to estimate the input measures  generally based on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours of the project  with consideration also given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and  accordingly  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance of services exists  we apply the completed contract method of accounting and defer the associated revenue until the contract is completed 
if we are unable to accurately estimate the input measures used for percentage of completion accounting  revenue would be deferred until the contract is complete  and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method in excess of contract billings is recorded as an unbilled receivable 
such amounts are generally billable upon reaching certain performance milestones as defined by individual contracts 
billings collected in advance of performance and recognition of revenue under contracts is recorded as deferred revenue 
in certain of our non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
as described above  sometimes our customer arrangements have multiple deliverables  including service elements 
generally  our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of specific accounting standards that provide guidance regarding the separation of elements in multiple deliverable arrangements and the allocation of consideration among those elements 
if not  we apply separation provisions  which require us to unbundle multiple element arrangements into separate units of accounting when the delivered element s has stand alone value and fair value of the undelivered element s exists 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to each unit 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to the entire arrangement 
sometimes this results in recognizing the entire arrangement fee when delivery of the last element in a multiple element arrangement occurs 
for example  if the last undelivered element is a service  we recognize revenue for the entire arrangement fee as the service is 
table of contents performed  or if no pattern of performance is discernable  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement 
we apply accounting guidance to determine whether the company should report revenue for certain transactions based upon the gross amount billed to the customer  or the net amount retained by the company 
in accordance with the guidance we record revenue on a gross basis for sales in which we have acted as the principal and on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment cycles 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  and in certain cases non recurring charges associated with the write off of in process research and development ipr d  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  in connection with our business combinations accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
we amortize our definite lived intangible assets using the straight line method or based on forecasted cash flows associated with the assets over the estimated useful lives  while ipr d is recorded as a non recurring charge on the acquisition date 
goodwill is not amortized  but is assessed at least annually for impairment 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales and services  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents or trademarks  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value and useful lives are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur and assumptions may change 
estimates using different assumptions could also produce significantly different results 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of the impairment of our intangible assets 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to our previously recorded intangible assets with finite useful lives  we test for impairment using undiscounted cash flows 
if such tests indicate impairment  then we measure the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset  which is measured using discounted cash flows 
indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of such intangible assets  measured using discounted cash flows  to the respective fair value 
to the extent the fair value is less than the associated carrying value  impairment is recorded 
significant management judgment is required in forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and other long lived assets could occur 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 

table of contents we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified 
we have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly traded companies 
these methods require estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital  and other relevant factors  as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly traded companies for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  industry data  and other relevant factors 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal  indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of our most recent testing date 
accordingly  we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
there are various assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
due to ongoing uncertainty in economic conditions and weakness in financial credit markets  which have adversely affected the fair value of our reporting units  we will continue to carefully monitor and evaluate the carrying value of goodwill 
we had million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  as of the most recent testing date july   the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by between million and million 
however  if difficult market and economic conditions continue over a sustained period  we may experience a further decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units as compared to fiscal year end levels 
such further declines in fair value may require us to record an impairment charge related to goodwill 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation using the fair value recognition provisions as required in the accounting literature 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on a combination of the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock and our historical volatility rate 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
beginning in fiscal  we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
in fiscal  we estimated the expected term consistent with the simplified method 
the dividend yield assumption is based on historical dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee options 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted  we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our share based compensation expense  net income and earnings per share 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

table of contents we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  which requires the use of estimates 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period or reduce goodwill if such deferred tax asset relates to an acquisition 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period or increase goodwill if such deferred tax asset relates to an acquisition 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  there is no assurance that our valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable  and such an increase could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities also involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could also have a material impact on our income tax provision and results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
we adopted new accounting guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on october  the cumulative effect of the change did not result in an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
following implementation  the ongoing recognition of changes in measurement of uncertain tax positions will be reflected as a component of income tax expense 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to products and services  technology  labor  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
if the potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
if the potential loss is considered less than probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure of the matter is considered 
the amount of loss accrual or disclosure  if any  is determined after analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
due to uncertainties related to these matters  accruals or disclosures are based on the best information available at the time 
significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses 
revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for business combinations 
the guidance states that business combinations will result in all assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their fair values 
certain forms of contingent consideration and acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
further  acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of determining what effect  if any  the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the guidance clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and  accordingly  requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of determining what effect  if any  the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which deferred the effective date of applying fair value measurement guidance for non financial assets and liabilities  except for items that are 
table of contents recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we elected to defer the adoption of this guidance until october  we are in the process of determining the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
we are in the process of determining what effect  if any  the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance removes the fair value threshold for separation of deliverables into separate units of accounting and in many cases will result in accelerated revenue recognition 
the guidance also replaces the term fair value with selling price  provides a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling price  which is used in allocating revenue to each deliverable  eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation  and expands certain disclosures 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  entities can elect to apply this issue on a prospective or a retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted 
we are in the process of determining the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for convertible instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
the guidance requires that proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt instruments be allocated between debt at a discount and an equity component 
the debt discount will be amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is to be applied retrospectively to prior periods 
the guidance changes the accounting treatment for our senior convertible notes  which were issued in august  however  the only retrospective adjustment to our financial statements would be a reclassification between equity accounts 
the guidance does not require retrospective adoption if instruments were not outstanding during any of the periods presented in the annual financial statements for the period of adoption  or if restatement would only lead to an entity reclassifying amounts between its opening equity accounts for periods presented in the annual financial statements 
as a result  the adoption of this guidance will not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new guidance in determining the useful life of intangible assets 
the guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this new guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of determining what effect  if any  the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of two years or less 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio

the margin on libor borrowings ranges from to and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the fair value of the instrument 
we had million of borrowings outstanding on this facility as of september  and forward foreign currency contracts we maintain a program to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk on existing foreign currency receivable and cash balances by entering into forward contracts to sell or buy foreign currency 
at period end  foreign denominated receivables and cash balances held by our us reporting entities are remeasured into the us dollar functional currency at current market rates 
the change in value from this remeasurement is then reported as a foreign exchange gain or loss for that period in our accompanying consolidated statements of income and the resulting gain or loss on the forward contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated assets
