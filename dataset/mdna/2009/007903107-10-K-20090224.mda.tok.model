our industry semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems 
an integrated circuit  or ic  is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip 
since the invention of the transistor in  improvements in ic process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller  more complex and more reliable ics at a lower cost per function 
in order to satisfy the demand for faster  smaller and lower cost ics  semiconductor manufacturers have continually developed improvements in manufacturing and process technology 
ics are increasingly being manufactured using smaller geometries on larger silicon wafers 
use of smaller process geometries can result in products that are higher performing  use less power and cost less to manufacture on a per unit basis 
use of larger wafers can contribute further to a decrease in manufacturing costs per unit and to an increase in capacity by yielding more chips per wafer 
computing solutions the x microprocessor market a microprocessor is an ic that serves as the central processing unit  or cpu  of a computer 
it generally consists of millions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system  acting as the brain of the computer 
the performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems 
the principal indicators of cpu performance are work per cycle  or how many instructions are executed per cycle  clock speed  representing the rate at which a cpu s internal logic operates  measured in units of hertz  or cycles per second  and power consumption 
other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of cpus  or cores  on a microprocessor  the bit rating of the microprocessor  memory size and data access speed 
developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance 
currently  microprocessors are designed to process bits or bits of information at one time 
the bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle 
microprocessors with bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory 
moreover  as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the exponential growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications  semiconductor companies have transitioned from designing and developing single core microprocessors to also designing and developing multi core microprocessors  where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor 
multi core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed 
moreover  multiple processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted 
this type of symmetrical multiprocessing is effective in both multi tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously and also for multi threaded software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program  or threads  simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the application 
businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology  which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership 

table of contents we also believe that businesses and consumers want more integrated computing solutions or platform products 
a platform is a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution 
we believe that integrated platforms bring end users improved system stability  increased performance and energy efficiency while enabling faster time to market for systems manufacturers 
microprocessor products we currently offer single core and multi core microprocessor products for servers  workstations  notebooks and desktop pcs 
our current microprocessors are designed with both bit and bit processing capabilities 
we based our microprocessors on the x instruction set architecture and amd s direct connect architecture 
amd direct connect architecture connects an on chip memory controller and input output  or i o  channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores 
for multi core microprocessors  we integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die and each core has its own dedicated cache  which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die  permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions 
some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as l  or second level cache  and l  or third level cache  to enable faster data access and higher performance 
we believe this architecture  and the integrated memory controller in particular  enables substantially higher performance than traditional front side bus architectures because memory can be accessed more directly  resulting in increased bandwidth and reduced memory latencies 
our processors support hypertransport technology  which is a high bandwidth communications interface that enables substantially higher multi processor performance and scalability than competing x architectures 
in designing our processors  we also focus on continuously improving power management technology  or performance per watt 
to that end  we offer processors that feature amd powernow and cool n quiet technology  which are designed to reduce system level energy consumption  with multiple levels of lower clock speed and voltage states that can significantly reduce processor power consumption during idle times 
our microprocessors are designed to be compatible with operating system software such as the microsoft windows family of operating systems  linux  netware  solaris and unix 
we also designed amd s direct connect architecture to enhance the security of a user s computing environment by integrating security features that are designed to prevent the spread of certain viruses when enabled by the anti virus features of current versions of certain operating systems  including linux  the microsoft windows family of operating systems and solaris operating systems 
in  we developed a number of integrated computing solutions in the form of computing platforms 
our platforms include microprocessors  graphics processing units  or gpus  chipsets and core software

amd opteron processors for servers and workstations with direct connect architecture are designed to enable simultaneous bit and bit computing 
these processors can be used in a variety of server applications  including business processing enterprise resource planning  customer relationship management  and supply chain management and business intelligence 
they can also be used in workstation applications such 
table of contents as engineering and digital content creation and other information technology infrastructure applications such as intensive web serving  virtualization and messaging 
amd opteron processors also allow enterprise customers to efficiently implement virtualization across their businesses 
virtualization is the use of software to allow multiple discrete operating systems and application environments to share a single physical computer by providing the illusion that each operating system has full control over the underlying hardware 
by enabling different operating systems and applications to run on the same server  virtualization offers the benefit of consolidating workloads and reducing hardware requirements  which can also reduce power  cooling and system management costs 
in november  we introduced nanometer quad core amd opteron processors 
these processors incorporated four processor cores on a single die of silicon and added a mb shared l cache 
the increased cache helps increase the speed of memory intensive applications 
quad core amd opteron processors offer improved overall performance on many different applications compared to the dual core amd opteron processors by executing more operations simultaneously during each clock cycle and by improving performance per watt  which can reduce the operational costs related to power usage 
quad core amd opteron processors also feature improved virtualization performance and a variety of power saving technologies  including amd coolcore technology  which we designed to reduce energy consumption by turning off unused parts of the processor when they are idle  enhanced amd powernow technology  which we designed to allow each core to vary its clock frequency depending on the performance requirements of the application being supported  and dual dynamic power management  which provides an independent power supply to the cores and the memory controller

we market and sell gpus for the consumer and workstation markets under the ati trademark 
our product brands for workstation are ati firepro  ati firegl  and ati firemv 
our product brand for the consumer and non workstation commercial graphics market is ati radeon 
we market gpus for the consumer electronics markets under the amd trademark 
we also have the amd live brand through which we promote our entertainment platform solutions for desktop and notebook pcs as well as film  broadcast and music professional artists that use amd technology 
we promote our gaming platforms for desktop and notebook pcs under the amd game brand  and our platforms engineered for business related applications and users under the amd business class brand 
we market our products through our direct marketing and co marketing programs 
in addition  we have cooperative advertising and marketing programs with customers or third parties  including market development programs  pursuant to which we may provide product information  training  marketing materials and funds 
under our marketing development programs  eligible customers can use market development funds as partial reimbursement for advertisements and marketing programs related to our products  subject to meeting defined criteria 
oem customers may qualify for market development funds based on purchases of eligible products 
customers our microprocessor customers consist primarily of oems  original design manufacturers  or odms  and third party distributors in both domestic and international markets 
odms provide design and or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers and oems 
our graphics products customers include the foregoing as well as add in board manufacturers  or aib manufacturers 
customers of our chipset products consist of pc oems  often through odms or other contract manufacturers who build the oem motherboards  as well as desktop motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards 
our sales and marketing teams work closely with our customers to define product features  performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet the needs of our customers 
we also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing  testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products in order to assist in optimizing product compatibility 
we believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers time to market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 

table of contents original equipment manufacturers we focus on three types of oems multi nationals  selected regional accounts and target market customers 
large multi nationals and regional accounts are our core oem customers 
our oem customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations  desktop and notebook pcs  and pc motherboards 
under our standard terms and conditions  oems do not have a right to return our products other than pursuant to the standard limited warranty 
in  hewlett packard company accounted for more than percent of our consolidated net revenues 
sales to hewlett packard consisted primarily of products from our computing solutions segment 
in addition  four customers accounted for approximately percent of the net revenue attributable to our graphics segment 
a loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
third party distributors our authorized distributors resell to sub distributors and mid sized and smaller oems and odms 
typically  distributors handle a wide variety of products  including those that compete with our products 
distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
in most instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date 
in addition  some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
aib manufacturers and system integrators we strive to establish and broaden our relationships with aib manufacturers 
we offer component level graphics and chipset products to aib manufacturers who in turn build and sell board level products using our technology to system integrators  or sis  and at retail 
we also sell directly to our si customers 
sis typically sell from positions of regional or product based strength in the market 
they usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies 
sis often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers 
competition generally  the ic industry is intensely competitive 
products typically compete on product quality  power consumption  reliability  performance  size or form factor  cost  selling price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility and stability  brand recognition  timely product introductions and availability 
technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions  regular price reductions  short product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements 
our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop  introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices  while reducing our manufacturing costs 
competition in the microprocessor market intel corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years 
intel s market power and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively  to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us 
these aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products  and adversely affect our margins and profitability 
intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and marketing programs 
because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market  intel has been able to control x microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the 
table of contents microprocessor market requires of us 
intel also dominates the computer system platform  which includes core logic chipsets  integrated graphics chips  motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system 
as a result  oems that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on intel  less innovative on their own and  in some cases  are essentially distributors of intel technology 
additionally  intel is able to drive de facto standards for x microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards 
as long as intel remains in this dominant position  we may be materially adversely affected by intel s business practices  including rebating  and allocation strategies and pricing actions  designed to limit our market share  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling  marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers  control over industry standards  pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants  including motherboard  memory  chipset and basic input output system  or bios  suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for intel platforms  and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of its oem customers 
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do 
we expect intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing  research and development  new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies 
to the extent intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies  or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do  we may be more vulnerable to intel s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products 
we expect intense competition from intel to continue 
competition in the chipset market in the chipset market  our competitors include suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets 
pc manufacturers are increasingly choosing to use integrated chipsets  particularly for notebook computers  over discrete gpus because integrated chipsets can cost significantly less than discrete gpus while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream pc users 
intel corporation manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market 
competition in the graphics market in the graphics market  our competitors include integrated graphics and discrete graphics suppliers 
intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business 
intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets 
moreover  computer manufacturers are increasingly using integrated graphics chipsets  particularly for notebooks  because they cost less than traditional discrete graphics components while offering reasonably good graphics performance for most mainstream pcs 
also  intel has stated that it intends to reenter the discrete gpu market 
intel could take actions that place our discrete gpus and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market  such as nvidia corporation  preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information 

table of contents other than intel  our principal competitor is nvidia corporation  and to a lesser extent  matrox electronic systems ltd  silicon integrated systems corp 
and via technologies  inc other competitors include a number of smaller companies  which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs  but lesser financial resources to do so  especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market 
in the game console category  we compete primarily against nvidia corporation 
other competitors include intel corporation and ibm 
research and development we focus our microprocessor research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development 
one main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance per watt characteristics 
we have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies 
we also work with other industry leaders  public foundations  universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development 
with respect to graphics  our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever changing demands of the pc industry on a timely basis so as to meet market windows 
we are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets  including commercial clients  mobile computing  and gaming and media computing 
we believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability  better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency 
longer term  our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors  graphics processors and video processors 
our research and development expenses for   and were approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively

we conduct research and development activities for our graphics and chipset products at design centers located throughout the world  including in the united states  canada  india and china 
in  we conducted our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with ibm 
under this joint development agreement or jda  we jointly conducted development activities on new process technologies  including nanometer  nanometer  nanometer and certain other advanced technologies  to be implemented on silicon wafers 
our relationship also included laboratory based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor  interconnect  lithography and die to package connection technologies 
we paid fees to ibm for joint development projects and we agreed to pay ibm royalties upon the occurrence of specified events  including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party 
bumping wafers is one of the final stages of the manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and test

at the same time  we also began the transition to nanometer process technology at fab  which we expect to be completed by mid the full conversion of fab to millimeter was delayed  rather fab was used to provide incremental capacity to fab we have sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with chartered semiconductor manufacturing pursuant to which chartered is an additional manufacturing source for our microprocessors 
we also have foundry arrangements with third parties for the production of our embedded processors  chipset products and graphics products 
with respect to our graphics and chipset products  we have strategic relationships with three semiconductor foundries  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  united microelectronics corp 
umc and chartered 
currently  we are in volume production in tsmc s and umc s millimeter fabrication facilities 
as of december   our graphics and chipsets were manufactured on       or nanometer process technologies at third party foundries 
smaller process geometries can lead to gains in graphics processing performance  lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing costs 
we are currently in the process of qualifying nanometer process technology for certain products and expect to release these products in the second half of we outsource board level graphics product manufacturing to third party manufacturers 
these include foxconn and pc partner with locations in china 
our facility in markham  ontario  canada is primarily devoted to prototyping for new graphics product introductions 
upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement  we would purchase substantially all of our microprocessor products from the foundry company pursuant to the terms of the wafer supply agreement 
we would be able to use another foundry company as a second source for certain of our quarterly microprocessor product wafer requirements and may source additional amounts from such foundry company to the extent the foundry company is unable to deliver products to us sufficient to meet our material customer commitments 
in addition  once the foundry company establishes a nanometer qualified process  we would purchase from the foundry company  where competitive  specified percentages of our gpu requirements  which percentage is expected to increase over a five year period 
we agreed not to sell  transfer or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets related to gpu products and related technology to any third party without the foundry company s consent  unless the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of the wafer 
table of contents supply agreement  including its minimum purchase obligations  where competitive  with respect to gpu products 
after reviewing forecasts provided by us  as agreed by the parties  the foundry company would allocate such additional capacity sufficient to produce our microprocessor product volumes set forth in the rolling  binding forecasts that we provide 
the parties would establish capacity requirements in advance for gpu products 
the foundry company will use commercially reasonable efforts to fill any capacity allocated to but unutilized by us with production for third parties so as to offset and reduce our fixed cost reimbursement obligations to the foundry company  provided that such efforts will not be required if there exists any unutilized capacity that has not been allocated to us 
at our request  the foundry company will also provide sort services to us on a product by product basis 
the price for microprocessor products will be related to the percentage of our microprocessor specific total cost of goods sold 
the price for gpu products will be determined by the parties when the foundry company is able to begin manufacturing gpu products for us 
the wafer supply agreement would terminate no later than february the wafer supply agreement may also be terminated if and when a business plan deadlock with the foundry company exists and atic elects to enter into a transition period pursuant to the funding agreement 
the foundry company will agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider  and continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the wafer supply agreement 
during the transition period  pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the wafer supply agreement  but our purchase commitments to the foundry company will no longer apply

intellectual property and licensing we rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third party copying and use 
intellectual property rights include copyrights  patents  patent applications  trademarks  trade secrets and maskwork rights 
as of december   we had more than  patents in the united states and over  patent applications pending in the united states 
in certain cases  we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions 
we expect to file future patent applications in both the united states and abroad on significant inventions  as we deem appropriate 
we do not believe that any individual patent  or the expiration thereof  is or would be material to our business 
in connection with the formation of spansion llc as of june and the closing of spansion inc s initial public offering  or ipo  in december  we and fujitsu limited transferred to spansion various intellectual property rights pursuant to an intellectual property contribution and ancillary matters agreement  or ipcaama 
under the ipcaama  spansion became the owner or joint owner with each of us and fujitsu  of 
table of contents specified patents  patent applications  trademarks and other intellectual property rights and technology 
the patents that we transferred included patents and patent applications covering flash memory products and technology  the processes necessary to manufacture flash memory products  and the operation and control of flash memory products 
we reserved rights  on a royalty free basis  to practice the contributed patents and to license these patents to our affiliates and successors in interest 
we also have the right to use the jointly owned intellectual property for our internal purposes and to license such intellectual property to others to the extent consistent with our non competition obligations to spansion 
we also have a patent cross license agreement with fujitsu whereby each party was granted a non exclusive license under certain of the other party s respective semiconductor related patents 
this patent cross license agreement terminates on june   unless earlier terminated upon days notice following a change of control of the other party 
we also have a patent cross license agreement with spansion 
the patents and patent applications that are licensed are those with an effective filing date prior to the termination of the patent cross license agreement 
the agreement will automatically terminate on the later of june  or the date we sell our entire equity interest in spansion 
the agreements may be terminated by a party on a change in control of the other party or its semiconductor group 
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement  we intend to enter into a patent cross license agreement pursuant to which we and the foundry company would grant to the other a non exclusive license under patents filed by a party or are otherwise acquired by a party within a certain number of years following the effective date of the patent cross license agreement 
under the agreement all of our issued patents and pending patent applications other than patents and applications owned by ati technologies ulc and its wholly owned subsidiaries will be divided between us 
the foundry company will own its allocation of patents and applications subject to pre existing rights  licenses or immunities granted to third parties relating to such patents and applications 
the patents and patent applications to be owned by each party after the division will be licensed to the other party pursuant to the patent cross license agreement 
in addition  we intend to enter into a non patent intellectual property and technology transfer agreement  where we would assign to the foundry company all of our right  title and interest in technology and non patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the manufacture  sorting and or intermediate wip testing of semiconductor products 
we will retain technology and non patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the design and or post delivery testing of semiconductors 
technology and non patent intellectual property rights used both in the manufacture  sorting and or intermediate wip testing of semiconductor products and in the design and or post delivery testing of semiconductor products will be owned jointly by us and the foundry company 
in addition  as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights 
one such agreement is the patent cross license agreement with intel which was effective as of january  under this agreement we granted each other a non exclusive license under each party s patents for the manufacture and sale of semiconductor products worldwide 
we pay intel a royalty for certain licensed microprocessor products sold by us or any amd affiliate anywhere in the world 
the license applies to each party s patents that have a first effective filing date during the capture period  which is the period from january  through january  either party may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and does not correct the breach within days after receiving written notice thereof 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement upon days written notice in the event of a filing by the other party of a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency  or any adjudication thereof  the filing of any petition seeking reorganization under any law relating to bankruptcy  the appointment of a receiver  the making of any assignment for the benefit of creditors  the institution of any proceedings for the liquidation or winding up of the other party s business  or in the event of a change of control 
for purposes of our agreement with intel  change of control means a transaction or a series of related transactions in which i one or more related parties who did not 
table of contents previously own at least a percent interest in a party obtain at least a percent interest in such party  and  in the reasonable business judgment of the other party  such change in ownership will have a material effect on the other party s business  or ii a party acquires  by merger  acquisition of assets or otherwise  all or any portion of another legal entity such that either the assets or market value of such party after the close of such transaction are greater than one and one third of the assets or market value of such party prior to such transaction 
backlog we sell standard lines of products 
consequently  a significant portion of our sales are made from inventory on a current basis 
sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time 
these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty 
generally  in light of current industry practice and experience and the fact that substantially our entire order backlog is cancelable  we do not believe that such agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
in connection with the sale of certain handheld assets to qualcomm in january  approximately employees have accepted employment with qualcomm 
upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement  approximately employees will transfer to the foundry company 
environmental regulations many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations 
these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air  water  and soil  remediation requirements  product chemical content limitations  manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions  pollution control requirements  waste minimization considerations  and requirements with respect to treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
if we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations we may be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes  import export restrictions  sales limitations  and or criminal and civil liabilities 
existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment  to modify product designs  or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure to adequately control the use  disposal or storage  or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products 
these regulations affect semiconductor packaging 
other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world 
we have management systems in place to identify and ensure compliance with such requirements and have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures 
however  we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws  and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us

if our proposed joint venture with atic is not consummated  our business could be adversely impacted 
on october   we entered into a master transaction agreement with atic and wch pursuant to which we agreed to form a manufacturing joint venture with atic  referred to as the foundry company 
if the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement are not consummated  it could have a number of adverse consequences for our business  including the following we would not improve our cash balance  on a consolidated basis  by approximately billion  of which approximately million will be available for current working capital purposes and billion will go to the foundry company to fund its operations  we would not be able to transfer approximately billion as of december  of our indebtedness to the foundry company upon contribution of our ownership interests in the german subsidiaries that own amd fab limited liability company co 
kg  the foundry company would not assume responsibility for funding future wafer manufacturing capital expenditures  we would not be able to take advantage  as a shareholder of the foundry company  of the shift by integrated device manufacturers  or idms  to a fabless business model  our stock price may decline  we would be required to pay wch a termination fee or reimburse atic and wch for certain expenses pursuant to the master transaction agreement  and our business and operations may be harmed to the extent that customers  suppliers and others believe that we cannot effectively compete in the marketplace without the joint venture or there is customer or employee uncertainty surrounding the future direction of our company in the absence of the joint venture 
the recent instability of the financial markets may adversely impact our business and operating results 
recently  there has been widespread concern over the instability of the financial markets and their influence on the global economy 
as a result of the credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy  our current or potential future customers may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  typically  the strongest quarter of our fiscal year  end user demand for pcs and servers decreased significantly 
in turn  our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to address end customer demand 
we believe this inventory correction will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of  particularly in connection with notebook pcs 
additionally  if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that they owe us 
any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
moreover  our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent  thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products 
for example  in january  qimonda ag  a supplier of memory for our graphics products filed an application with the local court in munich to commence insolvency proceedings 
in addition  the current economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funding through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities 
if global economic conditions deteriorate further or do not show improvement  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business and operating results 

table of contents if we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing  we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development 
although we make substantial investments in research and development  we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop  obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis 
our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing  if necessary 
our research and development expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts  our operating expenses would increase 
if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue  our operating results could decline 
during  we incurred substantial losses that had a negative impact on cash balances 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million 
as of december   we had approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities  including debt and equity financing 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
the recent developments in the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed 
our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development 
if we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects  our products may fail to remain competitive and we would be materially adversely affected 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations 
as of december   we had consolidated debt of billion 
our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations  if any  to make debt service payments  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of the adverse economic and industry conditions that we are currently experiencing 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt  or our guarantees of other parties debts  will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt  we may be required to sell assets or equity  reduce expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt  sell assets or 
table of contents equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the current credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges affecting the global economy may further adversely impact our ability to borrow sufficient funds or sell assets or equity 
the agreements governing our borrowing arrangements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
the indenture governing our notes contains various covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  except specified permitted debt  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  make certain investments if a default or an event of default exists  or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied  create or permit certain liens  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  use the proceeds from certain asset sales  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or sell assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety unless specified conditions are met 
in addition  our fab term loan contains restrictive covenants that prohibit our german subsidiary  amd fab limited liability company co 
kg  and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts 
our ability to satisfy these covenants  financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements 
a breach of any of these covenants  financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the fab term loan agreement 
the agreements governing our borrowing arrangements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings 
for example  the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our notes  notes and notes 
the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable 
if the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our notes  notes or notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness 
if we are unable to successfully implement our cost cutting efforts  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we incurred a net loss of approximately billion for we have taken and plan to continue to undertake a number of actions to decrease our expenses 
for example  in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of we implemented restructuring plans to reduce our expenses 
the plans primarily involve the termination of employees 
the restructuring plan implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of involves additional cost reduction actions that either have taken place during the fourth fiscal quarter of or will take place in the restructuring charges for the restructuring plan implemented during the second fiscal quarter of represent primarily severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits and the costs related to the termination of a contract 
the restructuring charges for the restructuring plan implemented during 
table of contents the fourth fiscal quarter of represent primarily severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits  contract or program termination costs  asset impairments and exit costs for facility site consolidations and closures 
for these restructuring charges were million 
of the million  approximately million will result in cash expenditures in in january we announced additional headcount reductions  primarily focused on manufacturing and sales  marketing  and general and administrative functions  and cost reduction activities including temporary salary reductions for employees in the united states and canada and suspension of certain employment benefits such as our k plan matching program 
these additional cost reduction actions will result in an additional charge in the first and second quarters of and may result in cash expenditures 
we also plan to reduce our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels 
if these reductions are not effectively managed  we may experience unanticipated effects from these reductions causing harm to our business and customer relationships 
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with required features and performance levels that provide value to our customers and support and coincide with significant industry transitions 
our success depends to a significant extent on the development  qualification  implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers 
our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements  at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets 
if we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies  we may lose competitive positioning  which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products 
delays in developing or qualifying new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows 
if our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems  they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration 
the process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer s system can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end users  which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business 
moreover  market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
over the life of a specific product  the average selling price undergoes regular price reductions 
the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain overall corporate average selling prices 
if we are unable to introduce new products or launch new products with sufficient increases in average selling price or increased unit sales volumes capable of offsetting these reductions in average selling prices of existing products  our revenues  inventories  gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us 
collectively  our top four customers accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue in moreover  historically a significant portion of ati s revenues were derived from sales to a small number of customers  and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenues of our graphics businesses in the future 
during  four customers accounted for approximately percent of the net revenue of our graphics segment 
if one of our top microprocessor or graphics business customers decided to stop buying our products  or if one of these customers were to materially reduce its operations or its demand for our products  we would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected  and may in the future materially adversely affect  our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns  often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change  wide fluctuations in supply and demand  continuous new product introductions  price erosion and declines in general economic conditions 
the current uncertainty in global economic conditions has also impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases  which has negatively impacted demand for our products 
our financial performance has been  and may in the future be  negatively affected by these downturns 
we incurred substantial losses in recent downturns  due to substantial declines in average selling prices  the cyclical nature of supply demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry  a decline in demand for end user products such as pcs that incorporate our products  excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution  including those of our customers  and excess production capacity 
if the current downturn in the semiconductor industry does not improve  we will be materially adversely affected 
the demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold 
fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our microprocessor and graphics businesses are dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop pcs and servers 
industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past  are currently adversely affecting us and may materially adversely affect us in the future 
in particular  during the fourth quarter of  which is typically our strongest quarter during the fiscal year  end user demand for pcs and servers decreased significantly 
in turn  our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to end customer demand  which materially adversely affected us 
we believe this inventory correction trend will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of  particularly in connection with notebook pcs 
the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high growth global markets 
if demand from these markets is below our expectations  sales of our products may decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive 
the markets in which our products are sold are very competitive  and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth 
we expect competition to intensify due to rapid technological changes  frequent product introductions and aggressive pricing by competitors 
we believe that the main factors that determine our competitiveness are product quality  power consumption  reliability  speed  size or form factor  cost  selling price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility and stability  brand recognition  timely product introductions and availability 
after a product is introduced  costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves  and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale 
we expect that competition will continue to be intense in these markets and our competitors products may be less costly  provide better performance or include additional features that render our products uncompetitive 
with respect to our graphics products  intel and nvidia are our competitors 
some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies  including interface  processor and memory technical information 
competitive pressures could adversely impact the demand for our products  which could harm our revenue and gross margin 

table of contents if we fail to improve the efficiency of our supply chain in order to respond to changes in customer demand for our products  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends  in part  on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis 
accordingly  we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing  distribution and fulfillment of our products 
as we continue to grow our business  acquire new oem customers and strengthen relationships with existing oem customers  the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because oems tend to have specific requirements for particular products  and specific time frames in which they require delivery of these products 
we have previously experienced challenges related to the logistics of delivering our products across a diverse set of customers and geographies on a timely basis 
if we lose microsoft corporation s support for our products  our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to innovate beyond the x instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products 
if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x instruction sets  independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our microprocessors 
in addition  software drivers sold with our products are certified by microsoft 
if microsoft did not certify a driver  or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft  our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on third party companies for the design  manufacture and supply of motherboards  bios software and other components 
we depend on third party companies for the design  manufacture and supply of motherboards  bios software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings 
in addition  we continue to work with other third parties to obtain graphics chips in order to provide our customers with a greater choice of technologies to best meet their needs 
our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with intel does not extend to intel s proprietary bus interface protocol 
if we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from designers and manufacturers of motherboards and chipsets  our business would be materially adversely affected 
as a result of our acquisition of ati  we design and supply a significantly greater amount of graphics products ourselves 
this may cause third party designers  manufacturers and suppliers to be less willing to do business with us or to support our products out of a perceived risk that we will be less willing to support their products or because we may compete with them 
as a result  these third party designers  manufacturers and suppliers could forge relationships  or strengthen their existing relationships  with our competitors 
if the designers  manufacturers and suppliers of graphics chips  motherboards  and other components decrease their support for our product offerings and increase their support for the product offerings of our competitors  our business could be materially adversely affected 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our antitrust lawsuit against intel  our business may be materially adversely affected 
on june   we filed an antitrust complaint against intel corporation in the united states district court for the district of delaware under section of the sherman antitrust act  sections and of the clayton act  and the california business and professions code 
our complaint alleges that intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and or incentive of intel s customers in dealing with us 
on september   the united states district court for the district of delaware granted intel s motion to 
table of contents dismiss foreign conduct claims 
the effect of that decision was clarified by the court s january  adoption of the special master s decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery 
as a result of these two decisions  we will be permitted to develop evidence of intel s exclusionary practices wherever they occur  including practices foreclosing us from foreign customers or in foreign market segments 
however  the court s ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the united states and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the united states 
trial is set for february if our antitrust lawsuit against intel is ultimately unsuccessful  our business  including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market  could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns 
a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter 
this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenues for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
in addition  our operating results tend to vary seasonally 
for example  demand in the retail sector of the pc market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season 
european sales are often weaker during the summer months 
many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 
industry overcapacity and current macro economic conditions could cause us to under utilize our microprocessor manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us 
it is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the demand for our products  making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity 
both we and our competitor  intel  have added significant capacity in recent years  both by expanding capacity at wafer fabrication facilities and by transitioning to more advanced manufacturing technologies 
in the past  capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry 
fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market  which is currently and may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us 
during periods of industry overcapacity  customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity  which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements 
if the demand from our target markets is below our expectations  we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities  which may result in write downs or write offs of inventories and losses on products for which demand is lower than we anticipate 
in addition  due to the current macro economic conditions  in general  and the decrease in orders from our oem customers which we believe will continue in  in particular  we also plan to reduce our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels 
many of our costs are fixed 
accordingly  during periods in which we under utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products  our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period 
when this occurs  our operating results are materially adversely affected 
if the demand for our microprocessor products is not consistent with our expectations  we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities 
this may have a material adverse effect on us 
manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse effect on us 
there may be situations in which our microprocessor manufacturing facilities  including our foundries  are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products 
capacity addition is dependent on many factors such as tool delivery  lead times  installation and qualification 
our inability to provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could result in an adverse effect on our relationships with customers  which could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents while currently  our owned manufacturing facilities are underutilized  if we do not have or cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our microprocessor products in the long term  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements  we could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on third party foundries and other contractors to manufacture our graphics and chipset products 
we currently rely on independent foundries such as tsmc and umc to manufacture our graphics and chipset products 
chartered semiconductor manufactures some of our microprocessor products 
we also rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture our high end graphics boards 
independent contractors also perform the assembly  testing and packaging of these products 
we obtain manufacturing services for our graphics and chipset products on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product 
accordingly  our graphics business depends on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices 
we cannot assure you that these manufacturers will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirements 
the manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble  test and package products for other companies  including certain of our competitors 
they could choose to prioritize capacity for other users  reduce or eliminate deliveries to us  or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice 
as a result of the recent global market and economic conditions and tighter credit conditions  the third party foundries that we rely on to manufacture our graphics and chipset products may limit investment in increasing capacity  which may increase the risk that these manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements in future periods 
we must have reliable relationships with our wafer manufacturers and subcontractors to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand 
if we move production of our products to new manufacturers or if current manufacturers implement new process technology or design rules  any transition difficulties may result in lower yields or poorer performance of our products 
because it could take several quarters to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner  we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame 
we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative foundries or contractors 
other risks associated with our dependence on third party manufacturers include reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and cost  lack of capacity in periods of excess demand  misappropriation of our intellectual property  dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors  reduced ability to manage inventory and parts  and exposure to foreign countries and operations 
if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of wafers  our ability to meet customer demand for our graphics business may be adversely affected and this could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement  we will rely on the foundry company to manufacture our microprocessor products and  once the foundry company establishes a nanometer qualified process  we will purchase from the foundry company  where competitive  specified percentages of our gpu products 
if the foundry company is unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis or to meet our capacity requirements  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to design and introduce new graphics products in a timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property 
in the design and development of new products and graphics product enhancements  we rely on third party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools 
our graphics business has experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available third party development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of its products 
the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from graphics 
table of contents products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the third party development tools available to us 
if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands  our business could be materially adversely affected 
if essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products  we could be materially adversely affected 
our microprocessor manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis 
we purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
because the equipment that we purchase is complex  it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another 
certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we are largely dependent on one supplier for our silicon on insulator soi wafers that we use to manufacture our microprocessor products 
we are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessor products 
similarly  certain non proprietary materials or components such as memory  pcbs  substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources and are often subject to rapid changes in price and availability 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
the credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy may impact our key suppliers who may reduce their output and become insolvent which may adversely impact our ability to procure key materials 
for example  in january  qimonda ag  a supplier of memory for our graphics products filed an application with the local court in munich to commence insolvency proceedings 
if we are unable to procure certain of these materials  we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations 
such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing our microprocessor products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors  including their foundries 
we continually modify manufacturing processes and transition to more advanced manufacturing process technologies in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs 
we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  delays in the development or implementation of new process technologies  changes in our process technologies  upgrades or expansion of existing facilities  or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process 
any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs or force us to allocate our reduced product supply among our customers  which could potentially harm our customer relationships  reputation  revenue and gross profit 
our issuance to wch of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  if and when exercised by atic  will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders  and the conversion of our notes and notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 
as part of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement  we intend to sell to wch  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
our issuance of the shares to wch and any subsequent issuance by us of additional shares to wch upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of 
table of contents our existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market by wch of any shares we issue to wch could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock  and the anticipated exercise by wch of the warrants we issue to wch could depress the price of our common stock 
moreover  the conversion of some or all of the notes and the notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
the conversion of the notes and the notes could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the notes and notes 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes or notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the anticipated conversion of the notes or notes into cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the state of saxony  the federal republic of germany and or the european union for fab  fab  fab or other research and development projects we may undertake in germany  we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies  which could materially adversely affect us 
we receive capital investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany 
the subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with  and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants  allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
if we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents  we could be materially adversely affected 
if our products are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware  we could be materially adversely affected 
our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware 
further  we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner 
if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us 
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us 
products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing procedures  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future  which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  material recall and replacement costs  delay in recognition or loss of revenues  writing down the inventory of defective products  the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts  defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury  and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers 
in addition  we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field 
as a result  we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects 
any of these problems could materially adversely affect us 
in addition  because we sell directly to consumers  we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes  or merely appears to have caused  an injury 
claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products  and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others 
a product liability claim  recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our receipt of royalty revenues is dependent upon the success of third party products 
our graphics technology for game consoles is being used in the nintendo gamecube  nintendo wii and microsoft xbox game consoles 
the revenues that we receive from these products are in the form of non recurring engineering fees charged for design and development services  as well as per unit royalties paid to us by nintendo and microsoft 
our royalty revenues are directly related to the sales of these products and reflective of their success in the market 
we have no control over the marketing efforts of nintendo and microsoft and we cannot make any assurances that sales of those products will achieve expected levels in the current or future fiscal years 
consequently  the revenues from royalties expected by us from these products may not be fully realized  and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs 
our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and executive personnel 
if we are not able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business  the progress of our product development programs could be hindered  and we could be materially adversely affected 
we outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions  including portions of our product distribution and transportation management  and co source some information technology services 
we rely on third party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished products among our facilities and to our customers 
in addition  we rely on a third party in india to provide certain information technology services to us  including helpdesk support  desktop application services  business and software support applications  server and storage administration  data center operations  database administration  and voice  video and remote access 
our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts 
we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms  in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected 
also  we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed  in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers  which could have a material adverse effect on us if the transition is not executed appropriately 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could materially adversely affect us 
we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders 
we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities 
generally  our customers may cancel orders more than days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products  which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing 
for example  during the fourth quarter of our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to end customer demand 
we believe this inventory correction trend will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of  which would increase our uncertainty regarding demand for our products and could materially adversely affect us 
with respect to our graphics products  we do not have any commitment or requirements for minimum product purchases in our sales agreement with aib customers  upon whom we rely to manufacture  market and sell our desktop gpus 
these sales are subject to uncertainty because demand by our aibs can be unpredictable and susceptible to price competition 
our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
moreover  pc and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles  which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on 
table of contents short notice for any reason 
we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  and the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize  could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory and an adverse effect on profit margins 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an incremental write down of inventory of million due to a weak economic outlook 
factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of the value of our inventory  a reduction in average selling prices  and or a reduction in our gross margin include a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  a failure to estimate customer demand for our older products as our new products are introduced  or our competitors taking aggressive pricing actions 
because market conditions are uncertain  these and other factors could materially adversely affect us 
our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks 
we market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party 
these agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products 
we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts 
if any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products  our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected 
additionally  distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
in most instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions  as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date 
some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
we defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors  resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs  until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors 
however  in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products  the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline 
recent failures in the global credit markets may impact the liquidity of our auction rate securities ars 
as of december   our investments in ars included approximately million of student loan ars  million of municipal and corporate ars and million ars in preferred shares of closed end mutual funds 
approximately percent of our ars holdings were aaa rated investments and all of the million student loan ars were guaranteed by the federal family educational loan program 
the uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our ars and auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
the auctions failed because there was insufficient demand for these securities 
a failed auction does not represent a default by the issuer of the ars 
for each unsuccessful action  the interest rate is reset based on a formula set forth in each security  which is generally higher than the current market unless subject to an interest rate cap 
when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers of the ars establish a different form of financing to replace these securities  or final payment is due according to contractual maturities currently  ranging from to years for our ars 
as a result the liquidity of these investments has been impacted 

table of contents during  under the guidance of sfas we determined that the fair value of our ars was less than their carrying value and as a result  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million 
at this time  we believe that the current illiquidity of these investments is temporary 
because of the unprecedented events in the ars market  we cannot predict with certainty when liquidity in the ars market will return 
if this market illiquidity continues or worsens  we may be required to record additional impairment charges with respect to these investments in the future  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
in october  ubs offered to repurchase all of our ars that we purchased from ubs prior to february  as of december   we owned million par value of these securities 
we accepted this offer 
from june  through july   we have the right  but not the obligation  to sell  at par  these ars to ubs 
prior to june   we will continue to earn and receive all interest that is payable for these ars 
furthermore  prior to june   ubs  at its sole discretion  may sell  or otherwise dispose of  and or enter orders in the auctions process with respect to these securities on our behalf so long as we receive par value for the ars sold 
ubs has also agreed to use their best efforts to facilitate issuer redemptions and or to resolve the liquidity concerns of holders of their ars through restructurings and other means 
however  during the course of our exercise period with respect to the ubs ars  ubs may not have financial resources to satisfy its financial obligations 
in the event ubs cannot satisfy its financial obligations  we would no longer have the certainty as to the liquidity of these ubs ars 
we have not realized all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ati and may continue to incur future impairments of goodwill and assets related to the business acquired from ati 
we have not realized all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ati  and since october we have incurred goodwill impairment charges of approximately billion  of which approximately million was included in discontinued operations as well as acquisition related impairment charges of approximately million  of which million was included in discontinued operations 
these impairment charges were taken following revisions to our long term financial outlook for the businesses of the former ati in light of then current market conditions and economic outlook  which we conducted as part of our annual strategic planning cycles and based on the preliminary findings of our annual and interim goodwill impairment testing 
for  the conclusion was also due to the deterioration in the price of our common stock and the resulting reduced market capitalization  which was an additional indicator of impairment 
as of december   the carrying amounts of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets were million for our handheld business unit  million for our computing solutions segment and million for our graphics segment which now includes revenue from royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our technology 
we considered the income approach in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill  which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates taking into consideration the estimated sales proceeds that we expect to receive from any divestiture of these businesses 
however  actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts  which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in further impairment of goodwill 
our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we maintain operations around the world  including in the united states  canada  europe and asia 
currently  all of our wafer manufacturing facilities are concentrated in germany 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in china  malaysia and singapore 
in addition  our graphics and chipset products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent 
table of contents third parties in the asia pacific region and inventory related to those products is stored there  particularly in taiwan 
we also have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy  we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets 
our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated revenue were percent in the political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include  without limitation expropriation  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  changes in tax laws  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property  difficulties in achieving headcount reductions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions  changes in freight and interest rates  disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities  and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs 
any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate  including public health or safety  natural disasters or general economic factors  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any of the above risks  should they occur  could result in an increase in the cost of components  production delays  general business interruptions  delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  potentially longer payment cycles  potentially increased taxes  restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us 
worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products 
worldwide economic conditions have adversely affected demand for our products 
also  the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the middle east have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect demand for our products 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations  directly or indirectly  and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive  which could materially adversely affect us 
the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states economy and worldwide financial markets 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could continue to adversely affect us 
we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the canadian dollar 
as a result of our acquisition of ati  some of our expenses and debt are denominated in 
table of contents canadian dollars 
additionally  as a result of a new sales program that has been implemented in china  some of our sales in china are now denominated in chinese renminbi 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
in the past  the value of the us dollar has fallen significantly  leading to increasingly unfavorable currency exchange rates on foreign denominated expenses 
however  during the second half of  the us dollar strengthened leading to favorable currency exchange rates on foreign denominated expenses 
whenever we believe appropriate  we hedge a portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as payroll and equipment and materials used in manufacturing 
we cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  the majority of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers 
an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products 
our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third party distributors 
from time to time  our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market 
gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us  thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately 
also  when gray market products enter the market  we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted gray market products  which adversely affect demand for our products 
in addition  our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues  because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel  there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products  including products that may have been altered  mishandled or damaged  or used products represented as new 
our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures  we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts  including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements  copyrights  patents  trademarks and common law rights  such as trade secrets  to protect our intellectual property 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad 
any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
furthermore  patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or  if a patent is issued  the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights 
in addition  it is difficult to monitor compliance with  and enforce  our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner 
in jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the united states and abroad  our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised  and we would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products 
from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions 
we also sell products to consumers  which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages 
with respect to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been notified  or third parties may bring or have brought actions against us  based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in the event that we cannot obtain a license  these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages potentially up to and including treble damages or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted  which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation 
the award of damages  including material royalty payments  or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products  would have a material adverse effect on us 
we could decide  in the alternative  to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims 
such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities 
our operations and properties are subject to various united states and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes  discharge of pollutants into the environment  the treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  and remediation of contamination 
these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations  including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater 
although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with any of them  a range of consequences could result  including fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes  import export restrictions  sales limitations  criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions 
we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used  stored  released  disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage 
certain environmental laws  including the us comprehensive  environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or the superfund act  impose strict  joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources 
these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of  or was not responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated 
such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility 
we have been named as a responsible party on superfund clean up orders for three sites in sunnyvale  california 
although we have not yet been  we could be named a potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated sites in the future 
in addition  contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities 

table of contents environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products 
these regulations affect semiconductor packaging 
there is a risk that the cost  quality and manufacturing yields of lead free products may be less favorable compared to lead based products or that the transition to lead free products may produce sudden changes in demand  which may result in excess inventory 
other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world 
while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures  we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws  and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
all of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in germany 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in china  malaysia and singapore 
the independent foundries we use to manufacture our graphics and chipset products are located in the asia pacific region and inventory is stored there  particularly in taiwan 
many of our assembly  testing and packaging suppliers for our graphics products are also located in southern taiwan 
on september   taiwan suffered a major earthquake that measured on the richter scale and disrupted the operations of these manufacturing suppliers and contributed to a temporary shortage of graphics processors 
additional earthquakes  fires or other occurrences that disrupt our manufacturing suppliers may occur in the future 
to the extent that the supply from our independent foundries or suppliers is interrupted for a prolonged period of time or terminated for any reason  we may not have sufficient time to replace our supply of products manufactured by those foundries 
moreover  our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in california 
in the event of a major earthquake  or other natural or manmade disaster  we could experience loss of life of our employees  destruction of facilities or business interruptions  any of which could materially adversely affect us 
our business is subject to potential tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states  canada  germany and other foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  there could be a material effect on our cash  goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of ati  income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
for example  the canadian revenue agency  or cra  is auditing ati for the years with respect to transactions between ati and its subsidiaries 
the audit has been completed and we have responded to the cra s letter of proposed adjustments in july we could be subject to significant tax liability as well as a loss of certain tax credits and other tax attributes as a result of the cra audit 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have not received any written comments that were issued more than days before december   the end of the fiscal year covered by this report  from the securities and exchange commission staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of that remain unresolved 

table of contents item properties at december   we owned principal engineering  manufacturing  warehouse and administrative facilities located in the united states  canada  china  germany  singapore and malaysia 
these facilities totaled approximately million square feet 
of this amount  million square feet were located in dresden  germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication  research and development  and administrative offices 
our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products is located in markham  ontario  canada 
this facility consists of approximately  square feet of office and research and development space 
we occupy five other facilities in markham  ontario that comprise over  square feet  including approximately  square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space 
in some cases  we lease all or a portion of the land on which our facilities are located 
we lease approximately  square feet of land in singapore and  square feet of land in suzhou  china for our microprocessor and test facilities 
as of december   we also leased approximately million square feet of space for engineering  manufacturing  warehouse and administrative use  including a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers  principally in the united states  latin america  europe and asia 
these leases expire at varying dates through we also have approximately  square feet of building space that is currently vacant 
we continue to have lease obligations with respect to this space that expire at various dates through we are actively marketing this space for sublease 
spansion inc leases approximately  square feet from us 
we currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month to month occupancy  or replacing them with equivalent facilities 
we believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes  and that  except as discussed above  the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it 
item legal proceedings in addition to ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business  amd or its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary  ati  is party to the following material legal proceedings 
the outcome of any litigation is uncertain  and  should any of the actions or proceedings where we are a defendant be successful  we may be subject to significant damages awards which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

we requested the following findings and remedies a finding that intel is abusing its market power by forcing on the industry technical standards and products that have as their main purpose handicapping us in the marketplace  a finding that intel is wrongfully maintaining its monopoly in the x microprocessor market in violation of section of the sherman act and treble damages to us in an amount to be proven at trial  pursuant to section of the clayton act  usc a  a finding that intel has made secret payments and allowance of rebates and discounts  and that intel secretly and discriminatorily extended to certain purchasers special services or privileges  all in violation of california business professions code and treble damages for our resulting lost profits in an amount to be proven at trial  a finding that intel has intentionally interfered with our valuable business relationships to our economic detriment and damages to us in an amount to be proven at trial for its resulting losses  as well as punitive damages  as permitted by law  injunctive relief prohibiting intel from engaging in any further conduct unlawful under section of the sherman act or section of the california business and professions code  an award to us of such other  further and different relief as may be necessary or appropriate to restore and maintain competitive conditions in the x microprocessor market  and an award of attorneys fees and costs 
intel filed its answer on september  on september   the united states district court for the district of delaware granted the motion of intel corporation to dismiss foreign conduct claims 
the effect of that decision was clarified by the court s january  adoption of the special master s decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery 
as a result of these two decisions  we will be permitted to introduce evidence of intel s exclusionary practices wherever they occur  including practices foreclosing amd from foreign customers or in foreign market segments 
however  the court s ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the united states and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the united states 
at a hearing on june   the court rescheduled the trial date from april  to february  the discovery process is ongoing 
other related proceedings on june   our japanese subsidiary  amd japan kk  or amd japan  filed an action in japan against intel corporation s japanese subsidiary  intel kabushiki kaisha  or intel kk  in the tokyo high court and the tokyo district court for damages arising from violations of japan s antimonopoly act

us consumer class action lawsuits in february and march  two consumer class actions were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against ati and three of its subsidiaries 
the complaints allege that ati had misrepresented its graphics cards as being hdcp ready when they were not  and on that basis alleged violations of state consumer protection statutes  breach of express and implied warranty  negligent misrepresentation  and unjust enrichment 
on april   the court entered an order consolidating the two actions 
on june   plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint  alleging violations of california s consumer protection laws  breach of express warranty  and unjust enrichment 
on june   a third consumer class action that was filed in the united states district court for the western district of tennessee in may alleging claims that are substantially the same was transferred to the northern district of california  and on july   that case was also consolidated into the consolidated action pending in the northern district of california

according to the complaints  plaintiffs filed each of the actions after reading press reports that amd and nvidia had received subpoenas from the department of justice doj in connection with its investigation announced in november into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards 
on october   the doj informed amd that it had closed its investigation into ati s pricing and marketing practices in the sales of gpus 
no action was taken by the doj in connection with the investigation 
all of the actions appeared to allege that the defendants conspired to fix  raise  maintain  or stabilize the prices of graphics processing units and cards in violation of federal antitrust law and or state antitrust law 
each complaint was styled as a putative class action and alleged a class of plaintiffs either indirect or direct purchasers who purportedly suffered injury as a result of the defendants alleged conduct

environmental matters we are named as a responsible party on superfund clean up orders for three sites in sunnyvale  california that are on the national priorities list 
since  we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites 
the chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the united states in the wafer fabrication process prior to in  we received final site clean up requirements orders from the california regional water quality control board relating to the three sites 
we have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders 
during the term of such agreements other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders 
we remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements 

table of contents to address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders  we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately million in accordance with applicable accounting rules and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup 
the progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty  and these costs may change 
we believe that the potential liability  if any  in excess of amounts already accrued  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other matters we are a defendant or plaintiff in various other actions that arose in the normal course of business 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations
