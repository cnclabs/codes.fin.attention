overview through skywest airlines and asa  we operate the largest regional airline in the united states 
as of december   skywest airlines and asa offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with more than  total daily departures to destinations in the united states  canada  mexico and the caribbean 
additionally  as of december   we provided ground handling services for approximately eight other airlines throughout our system 
as of december   we operated a combined fleet of aircraft consisting of crjs assigned to united  assigned to delta  assigned to midwest and nine used by skywest airlines as additional maintenance spare aircraft crjs assigned to united and assigned to delta  crjs all assigned to delta  brasilia turboprops assigned to united and assigned to delta  and atr turboprops all assigned to delta 
as of december   the atr turboprops were no longer in revenue service  and asa expects to return the aircraft to the lessor by february  we believe our success in attracting multiple contractual relationships with major airline partners is attributable to our delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin class fleet at a competitive cost structure 
for the year ended december   approximately of our aggregate capacity was operated under the delta code  approximately was operated under the united code and approximately was operated under the midwest code 
skywest airlines has been a code share partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in  skywest airlines expanded its relationship with united to provide service in portland  seattle tacoma  san francisco and additional los angeles markets 
in  skywest airlines expanded its united express operations to provide service in chicago 
in december  skywest airlines and midwest entered into an airline services agreement the midwest services agreement 
skywest airlines serves markets from midwest s hub in milwaukee 
as of december   skywest airlines operated as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city  a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver  chicago and the pacific northwest  and a midwest connect carrier in milwaukee operating more than  total daily flights 
asa has been a code share partner with delta in atlanta since asa expanded its operations as a delta connection carrier to also include cincinnati and salt lake city in september and april  respectively 
asa operates approximately daily flights  all in the delta connection system 
we provide a substantial majority of the regional airline service for delta in atlanta and salt lake city 
in connection with our acquisition of asa in september  we established new  separate  but substantially similar  long term fixed fee delta connection agreements with delta for both skywest airlines and asa 
we also obtained the right to use gates in the hartsfield jackson international airport located in atlanta  from which we currently provide service to delta 
delta has also agreed that if delta solicits requests for proposals to fly delta connection regional aircraft  asa will be permitted to bid to maintain the same percentage of total delta connection regional jet flights that it operated 
table of contents during  and  if asa does not achieve the winning bid for the proposed flying  asa will be permitted to match the terms of the winning bid to the extent necessary for asa to maintain its percentage of delta connection regional jet flying that it operated during historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled us to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of contract flying and our controlled or pro rate flying 
for the year ended december   contract flying revenue and pro rate revenue represented approximately and  respectively  of our total passenger revenues 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on the completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
on pro rate flights  we control scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receive a pro rated portion of passenger fares 
as of december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements  while approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining flown under pro rate arrangements 
financial highlights we had revenues of billion for the year ended december   a increase  compared to revenues of billion for the year ended december  we had net income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or per diluted share  compared to million of net income  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the significant items affecting our financial performance during are outlined below in june  skywest airlines was notified that midwest was in the process of organizing a financial restructuring 
subsequently  skywest airlines reached an agreement with midwest to reduce the number of aircraft operating under the midwest services agreement from aircraft to aircraft 
as part of the modified terms  skywest airlines agreed to defer a portion of midwest s weekly payment obligations from july  through november  the amount we agreed to defer plus certain amounts midwest owed to skywest airlines at june  will be payable  with interest  by midwest in four equal quarterly payments starting on august  because of the unique modified payment terms associated with the deferred amounts  we did not recognize the revenue associated with the deferred payments in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  the total amount of deferred payments for the year ended december  is million 
during  our operating subsidiaries  skywest airlines and asa  experienced reductions in the block hours scheduled by their major partners under their code sharing agreements 
under our contract flying arrangements with our partners  a portion of our compensation is received using fixed rates per completed block hour 
this reduction in block hours reduced the profitability of skywest airlines and asa in under those agreements as we were unable to reduce our operating costs at the same rate as the reduction in scheduled block hours 
the financial impact of the block hour reduction  imposed by our major partners during the year ended december  was larger than we originally anticipated 
for the year ended december  our block hours have decreased approximately from the year ended december  we are at risk for increased fuel prices on our pro rate flying operations  pursuant to which we receive a pro rated portion of the passenger fare as revenue 
as of december   we operated a total of brasilia turboprops under separate pro rate agreements with delta and united 
during the year ended december   the cost of fuel associated with the pro rate operations increased approximately million pre tax compared to the prior period 

table of contents our maintenance costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the timing of engine overhaul events 
our engine overhaul expense increased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the majority of the engine overhauls related to aircraft operated under our delta connection agreements and we were reimbursed for such engine overhaul costs by delta 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase in maintenance costs  excluding engine overhaul costs was principally due to other scheduled maintenance events on our aging crj and crj aircraft 
additionally  since december   we added four used crjs and two used crjs to our fleet 
compared to new aircraft  used aircraft typically experience higher maintenance costs during the first year of service 
total available seat miles asms for the year ended december  decreased  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of our major partners decreasing the utilization of our aircraft and a reduction in the number of aircraft we operated for midwest 
during the year ended december   we generated billion asms  compared to billion asms during the year ended december  at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities  compared to approximately million as of december  during the year ended december   we spent approximately million to purchase and retire approximately million shares of our common stock 
during the year ended december   we acquired three new crj s  which were financed through long term debt agreements 
we also acquired two used crj s under sublease arrangements with a major partner at nominal monthly amounts 
we also acquired four used crjs  which we financed under long term debt arrangements 
outlook on october   we announced skywest airlines plans to acquire additional regional jet aircraft through  of which skywest airlines intends to operate for united express  as part of an aircraft transition plan 
we believe this transition plan will allow united express to remove seat brasilia turboprops from operation under the united express agreement and add seat regional jet aircraft for united express flying 
generally  the turboprop removals are intended to occur in conjunction with deliveries of new regional jet aircraft in order to ensure a smooth transition in existing markets 
additionally  skywest airlines intends to exchange four seat crjs for four crjs configured with seats in its delta connection operations 
on november   we announced that skywest airlines placed a firm order for aircraft with bombardier 
during the fourth quarter of  skywest airlines took delivery of three crjs 
skywest airlines is scheduled to take delivery of the remaining aircraft during and the first quarter of on january   we announced that asa reached an agreement with delta to operate an additional ten crj regional jet aircraft 
the aircraft were previously ordered by delta and are now being contracted for flying with asa 
asa expects to take delivery of these aircraft between february and may we expect to acquire these aircraft under sublease arrangements with delta at nominal monthly amounts 
asa intends to use the aircraft as replacements for  seat crjs that are scheduled for removal from contract service between april and august  which is earlier than the existing scheduled termination dates as contained in the delta connection agreement 
as of december   the atr turboprops were no longer in revenue service  and asa expects to return the aircraft to the lessor by february  
table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  stock based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
our agreements with our code share partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
in the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we record that period s revenues based on the prior period s approved rates adjusted for the current contract negotiations 
also  in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we evaluate the dispute under our established revenue recognition criteria and  provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute 
accordingly  we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
maintenance we use the direct expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs 
under this method  the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed 
we use the deferral method of accounting for our brasilia turboprop engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the engine 
for leased aircraft  we are subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
with respect to engine overhauls related to leased brasilia turboprops to be returned  we adjust the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
with respect to skywest airlines  a third party vendor provides our long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs operated under our united express agreement 
under the terms of the vendor agreement  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 

table of contents aircraft leases the majority of skywest airlines aircraft are leased from third parties  while asa s aircraft are primarily debt financed on a long term basis 
in order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately million in intangible assets 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of certain of these assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
we recorded an intangible of approximately million relating to the acquisition of asa 
the intangible is being amortized over fifteen years under the straight line method 
as of december   we had recorded million in accumulated amortization expense 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate whether the book value of our aircraft is impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on the results of the evaluations  our management concluded no impairment was necessary as of december  however  there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december  includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
applying sfas no 
r  we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination in the option pricing model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and other factors 

table of contents fair value we have adopted sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas as it applies to financial assets and liabilities effective january  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
for additional information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
under sfas  we utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
we have valued non auction rate marketable securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if a quoted price is not available  we utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
for auction rate security instruments  quoted prices in active markets are no longer available 
as a result  we have estimated the fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow 
results of operations compared to operational statistics 
the following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below

operating revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
for financial reporting purposes  we record these reimbursements as operating revenue 
under the skywest airlines and asa delta connection agreements  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expenses 
we also record those engine overhaul reimbursements as operating revenue

in june  we were notified that midwest was in the process of organizing a financial restructuring 
we subsequently reached agreement with midwest to reduce the number of aircraft operating under the midwest services agreement from aircraft to aircraft 
as part of the modified agreement  we agreed to defer a portion of midwest s weekly payment obligations from july  through november  the amount we agreed to defer  plus certain amounts midwest owed us at june   are payable  with interest  by midwest in four equal quarterly payments starting on august  because of the unique modified payment terms associated with the deferred amounts  we did not recognize the revenue associated with the deferred payments in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  the total amount of deferred payments for the year ended december  is million 
ground handling and other 
total ground handling and other revenues decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue earned under other ground handling contracts where we provide ground handling services for other airlines is presented in the ground handling and other line in our consolidated statements of income 
the decrease was primarily related to the lower volume of flights serviced under ground handling contracts with united and delta  whereby we perform ground handling services for several other regional airlines 
individual expense components are also expressed in the following table on the basis of cents per asm 
asm is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline s passenger capacity

fuel costs increased million  or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average cost per gallon of fuel increased to per gallon during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the increase in the average cost per gallon during the year ended december  was mitigated by united purchasing fuel directly from a fuel vendor for our united express aircraft operated out of chicago  san francisco  los angeles and denver 
midwest also purchased all of its fuel directly from fuel vendors  which reduced our total fuel costs and related passenger revenue 
the following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased directly  and the change in fuel price per gallon on our fuel expense for the year ended december  in thousands  except per gallon amounts change fuel gallons purchased average price per gallon fuel expense we are at risk for increased fuel prices on our pro rate flying operations  whereby we receive a pro rated portion of the passenger fare as revenue 
as of december   we operated a total of brasilia turboprops under separate pro rate agreements with delta and united 
during the year ended december   the cost of fuel associated with the pro rate operations increased approximately million pre tax compared to the year ended december  salaries wages and employee benefits 
salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease in number of employees was significantly due to delta assuming responsibility from asa in june for the performance of customer service functions in atlanta and united transitioning stations from skywest airlines to other ground handlers during the second quarter of aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
maintenance costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the 
table of contents increase was primarily related to the timing of engine overhaul events 
our engine overhaul expense increased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the majority of the engine overhauls related to aircraft operated under our delta connection agreements and we were reimbursed for such engine overhaul costs by delta 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase in maintenance excluding engine overhaul costs was principally due to other scheduled maintenance events on our aging crj and crj aircraft and repairs incurred on aircraft damaged during the normal course of business 
additionally  since december   we added four used crjs and two used crjs to our fleet 
compared to new aircraft  used aircraft typically experience higher maintenance costs during the first year of service 
under the united express and midwest services agreements  we recognize revenue at a fixed hourly rate for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines 
we record the gross amount of that maintenance as revenue in our consolidated statements of income  and we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense in our consolidated statements of income 
as a result  during the year ended december   we collected and recorded million pretax of revenue in excess of our maintenance expense under the united express agreement and the midwest services agreement  which is intended to compensate us for the expense of future engine maintenance overhauls 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals increased million or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in aircraft rents was primarily due to the addition of two used crjs that were financed through long term leases 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the addition of four crj and three crjs that were financed using long term debt 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  our station rents and landing fee costs can be impacted based upon the volume of passengers carried and the number of departures 
the decrease in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to a decrease in passengers carried and a decrease in departures during the year ended december  ground handling service 
ground handling service expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in ground handling was due primarily to delta assuming responsibility from asa in june for the performance of customer service functions in atlanta and united transitioning stations from skywest airlines to other ground handlers during the second quarter of other expenses 
other expense  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other expenses was primarily due to the decrease in crew simulator training and crew hotel costs 
these decreases were due primarily to fewer training events in  primarily caused by lower production such as a decrease of in departures during the year ended december  interest 
interest expense decreased million  or during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was substantially due to a decrease in interest rates 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt

these factors resulted in a million increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  our position in marketable securities  consisting primarily of bonds  bond funds and commercial paper  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in marketable securities was due primarily to cash generated from operations in that were invested in marketable securities 
at december   our total capital mix was equity and debt  compared to equity and debt at december  as of december   skywest airlines has a million line of credit 
as of december  and  skywest airlines had no amount outstanding under the facility 
the facility expires on march  and has a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions 
as of december  and  we classified million and million  respectively  as restricted cash  related to our workers compensation policies 

table of contents significant commitments and obligations general the following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter firm aircraft commitments operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations interest commitments principal maturities on long term debt total commitments and obligations purchase commitments and options on october   we announced skywest airlines plans to acquire additional regional jet aircraft through  of which skywest airlines intends to operate for united express as part of an aircraft transition plan  allowing united express to remove seat brasilia turboprops from the contract reimbursement model contemplated by the united express agreement and add seat regional jet aircraft for united express flying 
generally  the turboprop removals under the united express agreement are intended to occur in conjunction with deliveries of new regional jet aircraft in order to facilitate a smooth transition in existing markets 
additionally  skywest airlines intends to exchange four crjs for four crjs in its delta connection operations 
these four seat crjs are scheduled to be placed into service under other capacity purchase agreements 
in november  skywest airlines placed a firm order with bombardier for the new aircraft 
during the fourth quarter of  skywest airlines took delivery of three crjs 
skywest airlines is scheduled to take delivery of the remaining aircraft during and the first quarter of on january   we announced that asa reached an agreement with delta to operate additional crj regional jet aircraft 
the aircraft were previously ordered by delta and are now being contracted for flying with asa 
asa expects to take delivery of these aircraft between february and may we expect to acquire these aircraft under sublease arrangements with delta at nominal monthly amounts 
asa intends to use the aircraft as replacements for crjs that are scheduled for removal from contract service between april and august  which is earlier than the existing scheduled termination dates as contained in the delta connection agreement 
total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment  including amounts for contractual price escalations  are estimated to be approximately million through the first quarter of additionally  skywest airlines agreement with bombardier includes options for another aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
delivery dates for these aircraft remain subject to final determination as we agree upon with our major partners 
we have not historically funded a substantial portion of our aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long term debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us  and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
in the event that alternative financing cannot be arranged at the time of delivery  bombardier has typically financed our aircraft acquisitions until more permanent arrangements can be made 
subsequent to this 
table of contents initial acquisition of an aircraft  we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  we intend to satisfy our firm aircraft purchase commitment  as well as our acquisition of any additional aircraft  through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with our historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for our operating activities 
nonetheless  recent disruptions in the credit markets have resulted in greater volatility  decreased liquidity and limited availability of capital  and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary funding or that  if we are able to obtain necessary capital  the corresponding terms will be favorable or acceptable to us 
aircraft lease and facility obligations we also have significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
at december   we had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  as part of our leveraged lease agreements  we typically agree to indemnify the equity owner participant against liabilities that may arise due to changes in benefits from tax ownership of the respective leased aircraft 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
long term debt obligations our total long term debt at december  was  million  of which  million related to the acquisition of brasilia turboprop  crj  crj and crj aircraft and million related to our corporate office building 
the average effective interest rate on the debt related to the brasilia turboprop and crj aircraft was approximately at december  the average effective interest rate on the debt related to our corporate office building was approximately at december  guarantees we have guaranteed the obligations of skywest airlines under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement and the midwest airline services agreement and the obligations of asa under the asa delta connection agreement 
new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf equity method investment accounting considerations  which address how the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be determined  how an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite lived intangible asset of an equity method investment should be performed  and the accounting for an equity method investee s issuance of shares 
our management believes that this will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
also  in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas  which we adopted as of january   in cases where a market is not active 
we have considered the guidance provided by fsp in our determination of estimated fair values 
table of contents as of december   and we do not believe the guidance had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  we have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs 
pursuant to our contract flying arrangements  united has agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted united express flights 
on our delta connection regional jet flights  delta has agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
we bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our pro rate operations 
as of december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements while  approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under pro rate arrangements 
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of the market risk of fuel on our pro rate operations using a hypothetical increase of in the price per gallon we purchase 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in fuel expense for the year ended december  interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
we would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of our available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt compared to of our long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  and we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  however  under our contractual arrangement with our major partners  the majority of the increase in interest expense would be passed through and recorded as passenger revenue in the consolidated statement of income 
we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through manufacturer financing  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact our actual costs of acquiring these aircraft 
auction rate securities we have investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as available for sale securities and reflected at fair value 
due primarily to instability in credit markets  we sold a portion of these investments 
as of december   we had investments valued at a total of million  of which million were classified as marketable securities and million were classified as other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
for a more detailed discussion on auction rate securities  including our methodology for estimating their fair value  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report
