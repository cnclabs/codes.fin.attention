our average episodic based revenue per completed episode increased from  to  from to and was due primarily to the development of our therapy intensive specialty programs  the focus of the new medicare payment system on providing more payment for home health agencies that have patients with a higher acuity mix and multiple co morbidities that require more intensive services  and the inclusion of the tlc agencies  which have had historically higher average revenue per completed episode primarily due to their presence in higher wage index areas ie the western and northeastern part of the united states

the rate has decreased over the past years  from in to in to in this trend does not necessarily indicate that we anticipate our internal episodic based recertification rate to decrease in the future nor is it a metric that we regularly use to measure growth within our organization 
this rate varies based on the clinical acuity of our patients 
we focus our efforts on providing the medically necessary care for our patients to achieve their desired clinical outcomes 
prior to providing additional episodes of care  we require the approval of an agency level  multidisciplinary care conference and the approval of the patients attending physician

our base or mature agencies are primarily concentrated in the southeastern part of the united states  as compared to our recent acquisitions  which include states outside of our southeastern concentration 
these other states have a higher wage index compared to our base agencies  which results in higher labor costs 
additionally  often the agencies we acquire pay visiting staff on a salary basis compare to a per visit basis 
as part of the process of converting acquired agencies to our operations  we convert our visiting staff from salary to a pay per visit model  which we believe promotes labor efficiencies and lowers cost

this net increase in other general and administrative expense was primarily the result of our acquisition and start up activities during other income expense  net other income was million in as compared to other expense of million during  representing a change of million 
the primary reason for this change was related to the conclusion of the alliance bankruptcy 
on september   a federal judge from the united states bankruptcy court in the northern district of oklahoma bankruptcy court overseeing the chapter federal bankruptcy proceedings for alliance finalized its order on the distribution of funds to creditors 
as a result  of the ruling by the bankruptcy court  the liabilities of million attributable to alliance now will not be paid because alliance has insufficient assets to discharge these liabilities 
these liabilities were recorded on our consolidated financial statements because of alliance s being a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary 
neither amedisys nor any of our affiliates other than alliance  has any direct obligation for these liabilities and we do not believe there is any basis for asserting that there is an indirect obligation on our part or any of our affiliates for these liabilities 
accordingly  upon completion of the alliance bankruptcy  we reversed the accrual for these liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  and we recognized a gain of million as other income in our accompanying consolidated income statement during the third quarter of the discharge of the liabilities was a non taxable event 
the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to the reduction in interest expense as a result in the decrease in our average outstanding debt for as compared to and an increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments due to an increase in the average cash and cash equivalents and short term investments from to during the third quarter of  we completed an equity offering with cash proceeds of million  of which million was used to pay off our senior credit facility and the remainder was invested in cash equivalents and short term investments 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in as compared to million during  representing an increase of million  which is primarily attributable to an increase in income before income taxes and minority interests that is partially offset by a decrease in the estimated income tax rate 
our income before taxes and estimated income tax rate was million and for and million and for the decrease in the tax rate was primarily attributable to the reversal of the alliance liabilities resulting from the conclusion of the alliance bankruptcy  which was a nontaxable event

our deferred tax liability increase was primarily the result of an increase in amortization of the tax basis of our intangible assets acquired from tlc and the increase in our depreciation and amortization was the result of an increase in tangible and intangible assets as a result of recent acquisitions 
see outstanding patient accounts receivable below for an explanation concerning the increase in our provision for doubtful accounts  these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions 
the decrease was primarily the result of a net increase in our patient accounts receivable  an increase in our accrued expenses and a decrease in our accounts payable 
our accrued expenses increased primarily as a result of our increased personnel cost compared to  as we continue to grow through both start up and acquisitions activity 
see outstanding patient accounts receivable below for further details on our change in outstanding patient accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities increased million during compared to  primarily due to our acquisitions of tlc million and family home health care  inc and comprehensive home healthcare services  inc hma million 
cash providing by financing activities increased million during compared to  primarily due to the proceeds related to our new million term loan  draws of million under our new million revolving credit facility and the proceeds from our issuance of million in senior notes  which were used to fund the tlc acquisition  as well as other items as detailed below in indebtedness 
this was partially offset by million in deferred debt issuance costs incurred as part of the tlc acquisition and million increase in principal payments of our long term obligations 
liquidity typically  our principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable  primarily through the medicare program  however  from time to time  we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity through sales of our equity or by incurrence of additional indebtedness 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million of availability for the issuance of any combination of preferred and common stock  under our effective shelf registration statement  and million in availability under our million revolving credit facility 
we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants of our credit agreements and our recently issued debt securities as of december  during  we acquired agencies for million in cash and million in notes payable  which contributed million in net service revenue  spent million in capital expenditures  with million was considered routine  and borrowed million to help fund our tlc acquisition described below in indebtedness  which has been reduced to million at december   as we have made our minimum required payments on the term loan of million and made million in payments on our revolving credit agreement 
based on our operating forecasts and our debt service requirements described below in indebtedness  we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations  capital requirements and debt service requirements over the next twelve months and into the foreseeable future 
as part of our current cash management process  we pay our outstanding debt with any available cash generated from operations and relying on availability of funds under our revolving credit facility for our liquidity and acquisition needs

index to financial statements monitoring the creditworthiness and solvency of our syndicate of banks that provide the availability of credit under our revolving credit facility as well as the status of the overall equity and credit markets 
this monitoring process has become more critical over the past several months as several financial institutions have either failed or have been acquired  there has been a severe lack of funds in the credit markets and the equity market has seen significant decreases in value and liquidity  as discussed in the risk factors set forth herein 
as of the date of this filing  we do not believe our availability of funds under our revolving credit facility is at risk  however  we continue to monitor our syndicate of banks in light of the credit market conditions 
if our availability under our current revolving credit facility decreases we may need to consider adjusting our strategy to meet our operating forecasts  debt service requirements and acquisition and start up activity needs 
such changes could include  but would not be limited to  meeting our minimum debt service requirements and meeting our forecasted operating needs with operating cash flows  while retaining any surplus in operating cash flows  as deemed necessary 
as we experience over a collection rate on our medicare claims  which represents of our net service revenue  we believe we could adjust our cash management strategy  as deemed necessary

our days revenue outstanding increased days to gross and days to net from december  during  we converted acquired home health and hospice agencies to our operating and billing platforms  which represented million in net service revenue 
as is typical with our newly acquired agencies  we experienced an increase in our aging of receivables due to regulatory and internal delays inherent in the conversion process 
the issues included change of ownership approval from cms  compliance with various state medicaid regulations  changing the name of provider from seller  fiscal intermediary approval and set up  and training our agency staff on our billing procedures once the acquired agency was converted to our operating platform 
additionally  we experienced collection delays related to our private episodic based receivables

also impacting our days revenue outstanding was million in medicare claims that we submitted between november  and december  that were held in a pending status as of december  by cms 
the delay related to duplicate document control number issued by cms  which created a processing error on their end 
the issue was industry wide in scope and the fiscal intermediaries  the fiscal intermediary shared system fiss maintainer  and the data centers all worked together to correct this issue

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves related to insurance and litigation  goodwill  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn net service revenue through our home health and hospice agencies by providing a variety of services almost exclusively in the homes of our patients 
this net service revenue is earned and billed either on an episode of care basis on a day episode of care basis for home health services and on a day episode of care basis for the first two hospice episodes of care and on a day episode of care basis for any subsequent hospice episodes  on a per visit basis or on a daily basis depending upon the payment terms and conditions established with each payor for services provided 
we refer to home health revenue earned and billed on a day episode of care as episodic based revenue 
for the services we provide  medicare is our largest payor  representing of our net service revenue during when we record our service revenue  we record it net of estimated revenue adjustments and contractual adjustments to reflect amounts we estimate to be realizable for services provided  as discussed below 
we believe  based on information currently available to us and based on our judgment  that changes to one or more factors that impact the accounting estimates such as our estimates related to revenue adjustments  contractual adjustments and episodes in progress we make in determining net service revenue  which changes are likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or our future financial results 
home health revenue recognition medicare revenue net service revenue is recorded under the medicare payment program pps based on a day episode payment rate that is subject to adjustment based on certain variables including  but not limited  to a an outlier payment if our patient s care was unusually costly  b a low utilization adjustment lupa if the number of visits was fewer than five  c a partial payment if our patient transferred to another provider or we received a patient from another provider before completing the episode  d a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required thresholds set at  and visits  e the number of episodes of care provided to a patient  regardless of whether the same home health provider provided care for the entire series of episodes  f changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  g adjustments to the base episode payments for case mix  geographic wages and low utilization  and h recoveries of overpayments 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of such payment adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over on medicare claims  and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable 
therefore  we believe that our reported net service revenue and patient accounts receivable will be the net amounts to be realized from medicare for services rendered 
for  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in estimated revenue adjustments to medicare revenue 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes  we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress 
episodes in progress are day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period  but were not completed as of the end of the period 
we estimate this revenue on a monthly basis based upon historical trends 
the primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period  expected medicare revenue per episode and our estimate of the average percentage complete based on visits performed 
as of december  and  the difference between the cash received from medicare for a request for anticipated payment rap on episodes in progress and the associated estimated revenue was included as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets for such periods  since only a nominal amount represents cash collected in advance of providing services 
non medicare revenue episodic based revenue 
we recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize medicare revenue for episodic based rates that are paid by medicaid and other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs  however  these rates can vary based upon the negotiated terms 
non episodic based revenue 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realizable from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
in addition  we receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self insured or are obligated for an insurance co payment 
hospice revenue recognition hospice medicare revenue gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of these adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes our historical collection rate on medicare claims  and record it during the period services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
additionally  as medicare is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap  we monitor our provider numbers and estimate amounts due back to medicare if a cap has been exceeded 
we record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and increase other accrued liabilities 
as of december  and  we had million recorded for estimated amounts due back to medicare in other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of our adjustments we believe our revenue and patients accounts receivable are recorded at amounts that will be ultimately realized 
hospice non medicare revenue we record gross revenue on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be realizable from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue and patient accounts receivable 

table of contents 
index to financial statements patient accounts receivable our patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from medicare  other third party payors and patients 
we believe there is a certain level of credit risk associated with non medicare payors 
to provide for our non medicare patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value 
we believe the credit risk associated with our medicare accounts  which represents and of our net patient accounts receivable at december  and  respectively is limited due to i our historical collection rate of over from medicare and ii the fact that medicare is a us government payor 
accordingly  we do not record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our medicare patient accounts receivable which are recorded at their net realizable value after recording estimated revenue adjustments as discussed above 
there is no other single payor  other than medicare that accounts for more than of our total outstanding patient receivable and thus we believe there are no other significant concentrations of receivables that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our patient accounts receivable 
we fully reserve for accounts which are aged at days or greater 
we write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and deem an account to be uncollectible 
medicare home health our medicare billing process begins with a concerted effort to ensure that our billings are accurate through the utilization of an electronic medicare claim review 
we submit a rap for of our estimated payment for the initial episode at the start of care or of the estimated payment for any subsequent episodes of care contiguous with the first episode for a particular patient 
the full amount of the episode is billed after the episode has been completed final billed 
the rap received for that particular episode is then deducted from our final payment 
if a final bill is not submitted within the greater of days from the start of the episode  or days from the date the rap was paid  any raps received for that episode will be recouped by medicare from any other claims in process for that particular provider number 
the rap and final claim must then be re submitted 
medicare hospice for our hospice patients  our pre billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from medicare for the services that we provide to our patients 
once each patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will bill medicare for the services provided to the patient on a monthly basis 
non medicare home health and hospice for our non medicare patients  our pre billing process primarily begins with verifying a patient s eligibility for services with the applicable payor 
once the patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will provide services to the patient and bill the applicable payor based on either the contracted rates or expected payment rates  which are based on our historical experience 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount of the receivables to the amounts we estimate will be ultimately collected 
our review and evaluation of non medicare accounts includes a detailed review of outstanding balances and special consideration to concentrations of receivables from particular payors or groups of payors with similar characteristics that would subject us to any significant credit risk 
where such groups have been identified  we have given special consideration to both the billing methodology and evaluation of the ultimate collectibility of the accounts 
in addition  the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in payment and an evaluation of collectibility based upon the date that the service was provided 
based upon our best judgment  we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected due to credit risk

index to financial statements insurance we are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs  including employee health  workers compensation and professional liability 
while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas we completed our annual impairment review as of october  and determined that no impairment charge was required 
depending on changes in medicare payment  admissions volume and other factors  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
as of december   there were no indicators noted that required us to re evaluate our annual impairment test 
intangible assets consist of certificates of need  licenses  acquired names  non compete agreements and reacquired franchise rights 
we amortize non compete agreements and reacquired franchise rights on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which is generally two years for non compete agreements and up to five years for reacquired franchise rights 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december  and  our net deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively  representing a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily related to an increase of million to the deferred tax asset related to federal net operating loss carry forward due to purchase accounting 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which provides expanded disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires expanded disclosure including  the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in a tabular format  information about credit risk  and strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  as of december   we did not have any derivative or hedging activities  however if we do in the future  sfas will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements specific items in a business combination 
for instance  acquisition related costs  with the exception of debt or equity issuance costs  are to be recorded in the period that the costs are incurred and the services are received 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  ie our fiscal year 
we expect sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time

sfas 
sfas gives guidance on the presentation and disclosure of noncontrolling interests currently known as minority interests of consolidated subsidiaries 
this statement requires the noncontrolling interest to be included in the equity section of the balance sheet  requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the consolidated parent and the noncontrolling interest  and expands disclosures 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively to fiscal years beginning on or after december  or for our fiscal year 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 minority interests will be presented as noncontrolling interests and will appear in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet and presented separately on the income statement and statement of comprehensive income  both retrospectively and prospectively after adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk primarily as a result of our borrowings to effect the tlc acquisition  we are now exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
our revolving credit facility and term loan carry a floating interest rate which is tied to the eurodollar rate ie libor and the prime rate and therefore  our consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate for the term loan and the revolving credit facility was 
a interest rate change would cause interest expense to change by approximately million annually
