competition moving and storage operating segment the moving truck and trailer rental industry is large and extremely competitive 
generally speaking  we consider there to be two distinct users of rental trucks commercial and do it yourself residential users 
we focus primarily on the do it yourself residential user 
within this segment  we believe the principal competitive factors are convenience of rental locations  availability of quality rental moving equipment  breadth of essential products and services  and total cost 
our major national competitors in both the in town and one way moving equipment rental market are avis budget group  inc and penske truck leasing 
additionally  we have numerous small local competitors throughout north america who compete with us in the in town market 
the self storage market is large and very fragmented 
we believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations  cleanliness  security and price 
our primary competitors in the self storage market are public storage inc  extra space storage  inc  and sovran self storage inc 
insurance operating segments the highly competitive insurance industry includes a large number of life insurance companies and property and casualty insurance companies 
in addition  the marketplace includes financial services firms offering both insurance and financial products 
some of the insurance companies are owned by stockholders and others are owned by policyholders 
many competitors have been in business for a longer period of time or possess substantially greater financial resources and broader product portfolios than our insurance companies 
we compete in the insurance business based upon price  product design  and services rendered to agents and policyholders

risk factors the following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
these risk factors may be important in understanding this annual report on form k or elsewhere 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national  regional and local competitors 
competition is generally based on convenience of rental locations  availability of quality rental moving equipment  breadth of essential services and products  and price 
financial results for the company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have 
we can not assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases 
moreover  if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well  we may lose rental volume  which would likely have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations 
the self storage industry is large and highly fragmented 
we believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations  cleanliness  security and price 
competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels  rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities 
competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels  limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affect on operating results 
entry into the self storage business may be accomplished through acquisition of existing facilities and for persons or institutions with the required initial capital 
development of new self storage facilities is more difficult however  due to land use  environmental and other regulatory requirements 
the self storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets 
we are highly leveraged 
as of march   we had total debt outstanding of  million and total undiscounted lease commitments of million 
although we believe that additional leverage can be supported by the company s operations  our existing debt could impact us in the following ways  among other considerations require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service payments  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt 
our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow 
to some extent  this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
if we must sell our assets  it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue 
in addition  we may incur additional debt that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness 
current economic conditions  including those related to the credit markets  may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
the united states economy is currently undergoing a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility  which has resulted in a recession 
the future economic environment may continue to exhibit weakness for an extended period 
this slowdown has and could further lead to reduced consumer and commercial spending in the foreseeable future 
our industries although not as traditionally cyclical as some  could experience significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
declines in consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to reduce pricing further  which would have a negative impact on gross profit 
a continued softening in the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry  business and results of operations and we can not accurately predict how severe and prolonged this downturn might be 
moreover  reduced revenues as a result of the softening of the economy may also reduce our working capital and interfere with our long term business strategy 
the united states credit markets are continuing to experience a contraction 
as a result of the tightening credit markets  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails  we may not be able to find a replacement  which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities 
in addition  if the current pressures on credit continue or worsen  we may not be able to refinance  if necessary  our outstanding debt when due  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt servicing and capital expenditures through fiscal year  if our operating results worsen significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate  or if interest rates increase significantly  we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions 
to meet the needs of our customers  u haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment 
our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing 
our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing 
this could lead to the company operating trucks longer than initially planned and reducing the size of the fleet  either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations 
another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment 
the sale of used equipment provides the organization with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment 
conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in resale values for our used equipment  this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results  which would result in increases in depreciation expense and losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment 
we obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers 
in the last ten years  we purchased most of our rental trucks from ford motor company and general motors corporation 
our fleet rotation can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers face within their own supply chain 
also  it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders 
general motors could lead to shortages of new trucks and repair parts for existing trucks 
although we believe that we could obtain alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks  we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take and termination our relationship with this supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time 
we seek to effectively hedge against interest rate changes in our variable debt 
in certain instances the company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps 
the company enters into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements 
we are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations 
additionally  a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to record these financial instruments at their fair value while not affecting cash flow 
changes in interest rates can significantly impact this valuation resulting in non cash changes to our financial position 
we are controlled by a small contingent of stockholders 
as of march   edward j 
shoen  chairman of the board of directors and president of amerco  james p 
shoen  a director of amerco  and mark v 
shoen  an executive officer of amerco  collectively are the owners of  shares approximately of the outstanding common shares of amerco 
in addition  on june   edward j 
shoen  james p 
shoen  mark v 
shoen  rosmarie t 
donovan trustee of the shoen irrevocable trusts and southwest fiduciary  inc trustee of the irrevocable c trusts collectively  the reporting persons entered into a stockholder agreement in which the reporting persons agreed to vote as one as provided in this agreement the stockholder agreement 
as of march   adagio trust company replaced southwest fiduciary  inc as the trustee of the irrevocable c trusts  and became a signatory to the stockholder agreement 
pursuant to the stockholder agreement  the reporting persons appointed james p 
shoen as proxy to vote their collective  shares approximately of the company s common stock as provided for in the stockholder agreement 
for additional information  refer to the schedule d s filed on july  and on march  with the sec 
in addition   shares approximately of the outstanding common shares of amerco are held by our employee savings and employee stock ownership trust 
as a result of their stock ownership and the stockholder agreement  edward j 
shoen  mark v 
shoen and james p 
shoen are in a position to significantly influence the business affairs and policies of the company  including the approval of significant transactions  the election of the members of the board and other matters submitted to our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that the interests of the reporting persons will not conflict with the interest of our other stockholders 
furthermore  as a result of the reporting persons voting power  the company is a controlled company as defined in the nasdaq listing rules and  therefore  may avail itself of certain exemptions under nasdaq marketplace rules  including exemptions from the rules that require the company to have i a majority of independent directors on the board  ii a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors  iii a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors  iv compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors  and v director nominees selected  or recommended for the board s selection  either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors 
of the above available exemptions  the company currently exercises its right to an exemption from the nasdaq rule requiring compensation of other executive officers  aside from the president  be determined by a majority of the independent directors or the compensation committee 
we bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from sac holdings 
at march   we held approximately million of notes receivable from sac holdings  which consist of junior unsecured notes 
sac holdings is highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others 
if sac holdings is unable to meet its obligations to its senior lenders  it could trigger a default of its obligations to us 
in such an event of default  we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of sac holdings is inadequate to repay sac holding s senior lenders and our junior unsecured notes 
we cannot assure you that sac holdings will not default on its loans to its senior lenders or that the value of sac holdings assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full 
our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry 
our business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
historically  revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months 
the fourth fiscal quarter is generally weakest  due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions and other factors that are not necessarily seasonal 
as a result  our operating results for a given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 
our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations 
compliance with environmental requirements of federal  state and local governments significantly affects our business 
among other things  these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the water  air and land and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
under environmental laws or common law principles  we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated 
we are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remedial plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary  refer to note contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws 
in particular  we have managed a testing and removal program since for our underground storage tanks 
despite these compliance efforts  we believe that risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and could become more stringent in the future 
we cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations  future environmental liabilities  the cost of defending environmental claims  conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal  state and foreign governmental entities 
specifically  the us department of transportation and various state and federal agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations  safety  and the generation  handling  storage  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
in addition  our storage business is also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings 
compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs 
the federal government likely will institute some sort of carbon cap 
this will likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries 
there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations 
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees  and changes in laws or other labor issues could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
the success of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellent customer service 
our ability to attract and retain this employee base may be inhibited due to prevailing wage rates  benefit costs and the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations 
should this occur we may be unable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantly increased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the internet for managing our business 
our information systems are largely internet based  including our point of sale reservation system and telephone system 
while our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to serve  it exposes the company to various risks including natural disasters and man made disasters 
we have put into place backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate this risk 
however  disruptions or breaches in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
am best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business 
in march  am best affirmed the financial strength rating for oxford  christian fidelity life insurance company cflic and dallas general life insurance company dglic of b with a stable outlook 
financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of oxford s business plans 
accordingly  if oxford s ratings  relative to its competitors  are not maintained or do not continue to improve  oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

william e 
carty  et al  cv two additional derivative suits were also filed against these parties 
each of these suits is substantially similar to the paul f 
shoen case 
the court consolidated the five cases and thereafter dismissed these actions in may  concluding that the board had the requisite level of independence required in order to have these claims resolved by the board 
plaintiffs appealed this decision and  in july  the nevada supreme court reversed the ruling of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with its ruling  allowing the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and plead in addition to substantive claims  demand futility 
in november  the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
in december  the defendants filed motions to dismiss  based on various legal theories 
in march  the court denied amerco s motion to dismiss regarding the issue of demand futility  stating that plaintiffs have satisfied the heightened pleading requirements of demand futility by showing a majority of the members of the amerco board of directors were interested parties in the sac transactions 
the court heard oral argument on the remainder of the defendants motions to dismiss  including the motion goldwasser motion based on the fact that the subject matter of the lawsuit had been settled and dismissed in earlier litigation known as goldwasser v 
shoen  cvn ecr d 
nev  washoe county  nevada 
in addition  in september and october  the defendants filed motions for judgment on the pleadings or in the alternative summary judgment  based on the fact that the stockholders of the company had ratified the underlying transactions at the annual meeting of stockholders of amerco 
in december  the court denied this motion 
this ruling does not preclude a renewed motion for summary judgment after discovery and further proceedings on these issues 
on april   the litigation was dismissed  on the basis of the goldwasser motion 
on may   the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of such dismissal to the nevada supreme court 
on may   amerco filed a cross appeal relating to the denial of its motion to dismiss in regard to demand futility 
the appeals are currently pending and the issues will be fully briefed before the nevada supreme court by september  environmental amerco is a party to several administrative proceedings arising from state and local provisions that regulate the removal and or cleanup of underground fuel storage tanks 
it is the opinion of management  that none of these suits  claims or proceedings involving amerco  individually or in the aggregate  are expected to result in a material adverse effect on amerco s financial position or results of operations 
compliance with environmental requirements of federal  state and local governments may significantly affect real estate s business operations 
among other things  these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the water  air and land and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
real estate is aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of its properties 
real estate regularly makes capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws and has put in place a remedial plan at each site where it believes such a plan is necessary 
since  real estate has managed a testing and removal program for underground storage tanks 
based upon the information currently available to real estate  compliance with the environmental laws and its share of the costs of investigation and cleanup of known hazardous waste sites are not expected to result in a material adverse effect on amerco s financial position or results of operations 
real estate expects to spend approximately million in total through to remediate these properties 
other the company is named as a defendant in various other litigation and claims arising out of the normal course of business 
in management s opinion  none of these other matters will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
