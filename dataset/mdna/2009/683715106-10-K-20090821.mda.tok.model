outlook for fiscal we believe that we have a strong position in the ecm market and that the market for content solutions remains robust 
we have a diversified geographic profile  in that slightly over of our revenues are from outside of north america 
also  slightly over of our revenues are from maintenance revenues  which are a recurring source of income and as such  we expect this trend to continue 
additionally  our focus on compliance based products also helps insulate us from downturns in the current macroeconomic environment 
we expect our revenue mix to be in the following ranges of total revenue license to customer support to services and other to 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenue by product type and geography the following tables set forth our revenues by product  revenue as a percentage of the related product revenue and revenue by major geography for each of the periods indicated revenue by product type in thousands change increase decrease license customer support services and other total of total revenue license customer support services and other total revenue by geography in thousands change increase decrease north america europe other total of total revenue north america europe other total license revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of software products to customers 
license revenue increased by approximately million primarily as the result of increased revenues from our north america operations and the impact of increased partner influenced sales 
the increase in license revenue is geographically attributable to an increase in north america license sales of million and an increase in license sales in other geographies of million offset by a decrease in europe license sales of million 

table of contents overall  our average license transaction size for sales in excess of  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as set out in the table below 
fiscal year fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter customer support revenue consists of revenue from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenue is generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
because of our large installed base  the renewal rate has more influence on total customer support revenue in comparison to the impact that the current software revenue has 
therefore changes in customer support revenue do not necessarily correlate directly to the changes in license revenue from period to period 
the terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months  with customer renewal options 
new license sales create additional customer support agreements which contribute substantially to the increase in our customer support revenue 
customer support revenues increased in fiscal by approximately million 
this was largely due to the growth of our north america operations 
the increase in customer support revenues is attributable to an increase in north america customer support sales of million  an increase in europe customer support sales of million and the remainder of the increase is due to sales generated in other geographies 
service and other revenue 
service revenue consists of revenues from consulting contracts  contracts to provide training and integration services 
other revenue consists of hardware revenue  a new revenue stream  which started in the second quarter of fiscal on account of our acquisition of captaris 
these revenues are grouped within the service and other category because they are relatively immaterial 
the increase in services and other revenues is due to an increase in north america service and other revenues of million  offset by a decrease in europe service and other revenues by million 
the remainder of the change in service and other revenues is from revenue generated in other geographies

the most significant components of these costs are personnel related expenses  travel costs and third party subcontracting 
also  starting in the second quarter of fiscal  the cost of selling hardware is grouped within this category 
overall gross margins on service and other revenues have improved as a result of higher margins related to hardware sales 
amortization of acquired technology based intangible assets increased by million due to the increase in intangible assets in fiscal on account of the acquisitions made by us in fiscal operating expenses the following table sets forth total operating expenses by function and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands change increase decrease research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer based intangible assets special charges recoveries total in of total revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer based intangible assets special charges recoveries research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  contracted research and development expenses  and facility costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained stable at for both fiscal and 
table of contents research and development expenses increased by approximately million  due to an increase in direct labour and labour related benefits and expenses of million as well as an increase in consulting expenses of million offset by a decrease in overhead expenses of million and a decrease in miscellaneous expenses of million 
the remainder of the difference is due to a decrease in miscellaneous research and development related expenses 
headcount at june   related to research and development activities increased by employees compared to june  in fiscal we expect research and development expenses to be in the range of to of total revenue 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and costs associated with advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained relatively stable at and for fiscals and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million primarily due to an increase in direct labour and labour related benefits and expenses of million and an increase in consulting expenses of million

depreciation expenses remained consistent in fiscal as compared to fiscal amortization of acquired intangible customer based assets increased by million due to the increase in intangible assets in fiscal on account of the acquisitions made by us in fiscal special charges recoveries typically relate to amounts that we expect to pay on account of restructuring plans relating to employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities  impairment of long lived 
table of contents assets and other non recurring charges 
generally  we implement such plans in the context of streamlining existing open text operations that get impacted by significant acquisitions 
actions related to such restructuring plans are  more often than not  completed within a period of one year 
in certain limited situations  if the planned activity does not need to be implemented  or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out  we record a recovery of the originally recorded expense to special charges 
restructuring plans relating to legacy employee workforce reduction and abandonment of legacy excess facilities of the acquired company are not included within special charges  but are accounted for as part of the cost of the acquisition  unless such charges relate to additional accruals recorded after the purchase price allocation period 
see note for more details 
the increase in special charges was due to the implementation of the fiscal restructuring plan which was announced in the second quarter of fiscal the plan is designed to restructure our workforce and to rationalize and consolidate our excess facilities 
for more details on special charges recoveries  see note net interest expense is primarily made up of cash interest paid on our debt facilities and the unrealized gain loss on our interest rate collar  offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our million long term debt obtained in october  the term loan  for the purpose of partially financing our hummingbird acquisition 
the term loan bears floating rate interest at libor plus a fixed rate which is currently set at per annum 
net interest expense decreased by million  which is primarily due to a decrease in the interest expense of the long term loan in the amount of million with the remainder of the change due to miscellaneous items 
for more details on interest expenses see note and also the discussion under long term debt and credit facilities under the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased by million in fiscal due to an increase in net income of million and an increase in non cash adjustments of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in non cash adjustments was primarily due to i a change in deferred taxes of million  ii an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  largely as the result of the impact of acquisition related activities and fixed asset purchases  iii an increase in employee long term incentive plan accruals of million iv an increase in pension related accruals of million and v an increase in share based compensation of million 
these increases were offset by i a change in excess tax benefits on share based compensation expense of million  and ii a change in the unrealized loss on the fair value of our collar by million  as the result of decreasing interest rates in fiscal the remaining change in non cash adjustments relates to miscellaneous items 
the decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million is primarily due to i a decrease in cash flows of million relating to a lower deferred revenue balance  ii a decrease in cash flows of million relating to a lower accounts payable balance  and iii a decrease in cash flows of million related to higher prepaid and other assets balances long term and short term 
these decreases were offset by i an increase of million relating to a lower accounts receivable balance  which is attributable to higher cash collections from a larger customer base  and ii an increase in cash flows of million due to a higher income tax payable balance 

table of contents cash flows used in investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily on account of business acquisitions 
in the aftermath of our more significant acquisitions  such as ixos  hummingbird and captaris  we typically implement exit plans for reduction of legacy workforces and legacy real estate facilities of the acquired company 
these plans are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules governing acquisition related accruals 
payments against these accruals are recorded as a use of cash in investing activities 
in fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities increased by approximately million 
this was primarily due to i approximately million having been spent on acquisitions during fiscal compared to million in fiscal  ii an increase of million spent on additional purchase consideration relating to prior period acquisitions  inclusive of the purchase of the remainder of the ixos minority interest in fiscal  iii an investment of million in marketable securities in fiscal compared to nil in fiscal  and iv an increase in capital asset purchases in the amount of approximately million  predominantly relating to software and hardware purchases 
the remainder of the change was due to miscellaneous items 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities consist of long term debt financing and monies received from the issuance of shares exercised by our employees 
these inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non scheduled repayments of our long term debt financing and  when applicable  the repurchases of our shares 
during fiscal  cash flow from financing activities increased by million primarily due to the fact that i we did not make any large prepayments on our long term loan as we had done in the prior year resulting in an impact of million  ii we had an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common share in the amount of million  and iii we had an increase in excess tax benefits on share based compensation expense in the amount of million 
the remainder of the increase is due to other financing related activities 
we did not enter into any new or additional long term debt arrangements during the year 
long term debt and credit facilities on october   we entered into a million credit agreement the credit agreement with a canadian chartered bank the bank consisting of the term loan facility in the amount of million and a million committed revolving long term credit facility the revolver 
the term loan was used to partially finance the hummingbird acquisition and the revolver will be used for general business purposes  if necessary 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
term loan the term loan has a seven year term and expires on october  and bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus 
the term loan principal repayments are equal to of the original principal amount  due each quarter with the remainder due at the end of the term  less ratable reductions for any prepayments made 
to date we have made total prepayments of million of the principal on the term loan 
these payments have reduced the current quarterly principal payment to approximately million 
as of june   the outstanding principal amount under the term loan was million  and we are in compliance with all loan covenants relating to this facility 
we have limited our exposure to the floating rate portion of the interest rate on the term loan by entering into a three year interest rate collar that has the economic effect of circumscribing the floating portion of our interest rate obligations associated with million of the term loan within an upper limit of and a lower limit of 
as of june   and in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the term loan agreement  the hedged portion of the loan was million june  million 
the collar expires on december  
table of contents revolver the revolver has a five year term and expires on october  borrowings under this revolver facility bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement 
the revolver is subject to a stand by fee ranging between and per annum 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver as of june   and thus far  we have not borrowed any amounts under the revolver 
mortgage the mortgage consists of a five year mortgage agreement entered into during december with the bank 
the original principal amount of the mortgage was canadian million 
the mortgage i has a fixed term of five years  ii matures on january   and iii is secured by a lien on our headquarters in waterloo  ontario 
interest accrues monthly at a fixed rate of per annum 
principal and interest are payable in monthly installments of canadian million with a final lump sum principal payment of canadian million due on maturity 
pensions as part of the acquisition of captaris  we acquired an unfunded pension plan and certain long term employee benefit plans 
as of june   our total unfunded pension plan obligation was million  of which million is payable within the next months 
we expect to be able to make the payments related to these obligations  in the normal course 
for a detailed discussion see note commitments and contractual obligations we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum annual payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows payments due by period ending june  total and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations net of million of non cancelable sublease income to be received from properties which we have subleased to other parties 
the long term debt obligations are comprised of interest and principal payments on our term loan agreement and a five year mortgage on our headquarters in waterloo  ontario 
see note litigation we are subject from time to time to legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  our management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not enter into off balance sheet financing as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space  computer equipment  and vehicles 
none of the operating leases described in the previous 
table of contents sentence has  or potentially may have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition including any possible changes in our financial condition  revenue  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in accordance with us gaap  neither the lease liability nor the underlying asset is carried on the balance sheet  as the terms of the leases do not meet the criteria for capitalization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles usgaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following business combinations we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets  intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition with the excess of purchase price  if any  being allocated to goodwill 
starting on july  we adopted sfas revised  business combinations sfas r 
our acquisition of vignette corporation  in fiscal  will be accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
pursuant to sfas r s acquisition method of accounting  we will recognize separately from goodwill  the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree  generally at the acquisition date fair value as defined by sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
goodwill  as of the acquisition date  is measured as the excess of consideration transferred  which is also generally measured at fair value  and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
the acquisition method requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates  as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates  as necessary  during the measurement period defined as the period  not to exceed one year  in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination in a manner that is generally similar to that under sfas upon our adoption of sfas r  any changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will be recorded in current period income tax expense  unless any such changes are identified during the measurement period and relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date  in which case the change is considered a measurement period adjustment and is recorded to goodwill 
upon our adoption of sfas r in fiscal  this requirement is applicable to all of our acquisitions regardless of the acquisition date 
our accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax position liabilities  restructuring liabilities and costs incurred to effect an acquisition will generally result in the recording of an expense to our operations as these expenses are incurred 
this contrasts with how we account for these items pursuant to sfas and related accounting guidance in fiscal and prior periods  which generally require that these items be included as a part of the purchase price allocation for the business combination and generally do not impact our expenses or results of operations 
we expect that changes in estimates of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax position liabilities 
table of contents assumed in an acquisition that occurred prior to the adoption of sfas r will be accounted for as a current period income tax expense if we do not believe any new information obtained after the acquisition date  about facts and circumstances  existed as of the acquisition date or was not identified within the measurement period 
sfas r requires that all acquired company restructuring activities initiated by us must be accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
prior to the adoption of sfas r we accounted for acquired company restructuring activities under fasb s emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a business combination eitf 
changes in estimates associated with liabilities recognized for restructuring plans pertaining to acquisitions completed prior to fiscal will continue to be accounted for pursuant to the eitf our open text based restructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas refer to note for details relating to our restructuring charges 
upon our adoption of sfas r  should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period  we will report the provisional amounts for such items in our consolidated financial statements 
during the measurement period  we will adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we will record those adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant will be applied retroactively to comparative information in our consolidated financial statements  including adjustments to depreciation  amortization  or other income effects recognized in the initial accounting 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we test long lived assets or asset groups  such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets  for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value  which for this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or asset group 
we have not recorded any impairment charges for long lived assets during the years ended june  and acquired intangibles acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships associated with various acquisitions 
acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions 
we amortize acquired technology over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer relationships represent relationships that we have with customers of the acquired companies and are either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable  that is  capable of being separated 
table of contents from the acquired entity and being sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
these customer relationships are initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
we amortize customer relationships on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate the remaining estimated useful life of our intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
goodwill fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas  we do not amortize goodwill 
we performed  in accordance with sfas  our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of april  the analysis indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of our reporting units during the years ended june  and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations  we adjust our credit limit to the respective customer 
in addition to these evaluations  we conduct on going credit evaluations of our customers payment history and current creditworthiness 
the allowance is maintained for of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and  for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible  an allowance is maintained for a specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts  our historical collection experience and current economic expectations 
to date  the actual losses have been within our expectations 
no single customer accounted for more than of the accounts receivable balance as of june  and revenue recognition a license revenues we recognize revenue in accordance with sfas of position sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa in october as amended by sop issued in december we record product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance by the customer  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our significant pcs renewal experience  from our existing worldwide base 
our multiple element sales arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew pcs after the bundled term ends 
these rights are irrevocable to the customer s benefit  and the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew 
further  the renewal pcs options are for services comparable to the bundled pcs and cover similar terms 

table of contents it is our experience that customers generally exercise their renewal pcs option 
in the renewal transaction  pcs is sold on a stand alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement 
the renewal pcs price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we assess whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring 
our sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms 
these terms effectively relate to all customers  products  and arrangements regardless of customer type  product mix or arrangement size 
the only time exceptions are made to these standard terms is on certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs 
in these jurisdictions  our customary payment terms are in line with local practice 
b service revenues service revenues consist of revenues from consulting  implementation  training and integration services 
these services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services 
for those contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction  we determine vsoe of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
these consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are  on average  less than six months in length 
revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are rendered as the time is incurred by us 
we also enter into contracts that are primarily fixed fee arrangements wherein the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element 
in such cases the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed 
c customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide pcs to license holders 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advance billings of pcs are not recorded to the extent that the term of the pcs has not commenced and payment has not been received 
deferred revenue deferred revenue primarily relates to support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services 
generally  the services will be provided in the next twelve months 
long term sales contracts we entered into certain long term sales contracts involving the sale of integrated solutions that include the modification and customization of software and the provision of services that are essential to the functionality of the other elements in this arrangement 
as prescribed by sop  we recognize revenue from such arrangements in accordance with the contract accounting guidelines in sop  accounting for performance of construction type contracts sop after evaluating for separation of any non sop elements in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 

table of contents when circumstances exist that allow us to make reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  contract costs and the progress of the contract to completion  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under the poc method  progress towards completion of the contract is measured based upon either input measures or output measures 
we measure progress towards completion based upon an input measure and calculate this as the proportion of the actual hours incurred compared to the total estimated hours 
for training and integration services rendered under such contracts  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
we will review  on a quarterly basis  the total estimated remaining costs to completion for each of these contracts and apply the impact of any changes on the poc prospectively 
if at any time we anticipate that the estimated remaining costs to completion will exceed the value of the contract  the loss will be recognized immediately 
when circumstances exist that prevent us from making reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the completed contract method 
sales to resellers and channel partners we execute certain sales contracts through resellers and distributors collectively  resellers and also large  well capitalized partners such as sap ag and accenture inc collectively  channel partners 
we recognize revenue relating to sales through resellers when all the recognition criteria have been met in other words  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred in the reporting period  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
typically  we recognize revenue to resellers only after the reseller communicates the occurrence of end user sales to us  since we do not have privity of contract with the end user 
in addition we assess the creditworthiness of each reseller  and if the reseller is newly formed  undercapitalized  or in financial difficulty  any revenues expected to emanate from such resellers are deferred and recognized only when cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue relating to sales through channel partners in the reporting period in which we receive evidence  from the channel partner  of end user sales collectively  the documentation and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as a result  if the documentation is not received within a given reporting period we recognize the revenue in a period subsequent to the period in which the channel partner completes the sale to the end user 
rights of return and other incentives we do not generally offer rights of return or any other incentives such as concessions  product rotation  or price protection and  therefore  do not provide for or make estimates of rights of return and similar incentives 
allowance for product returns we provide allowances for estimated returns and return rights that exist for certain legacy captaris customers 
in general  our customers are not granted return rights at the time of sale 
however  captaris has historically accepted returns and  has therefore  reduced recognized revenue for estimated product returns 
for those customers to whom we do grant return rights  we reduce revenue by an estimate of these returns 
if we cannot reasonably estimate these returns  we defer the revenue until the return rights lapse 
for software sold to resellers for which we have granted exchange rights  we defer the revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end users 
when customer acceptance provisions are present and we cannot reasonably estimate returns  we recognize revenue upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and 
table of contents liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
these temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
on july   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb sfas fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions under fas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize 
the amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized 
the tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not capable of being sustained 
on subsequent recognition and measurement the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the company s best estimate  given the information available at the reporting date  although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final 
we did not recognize an increase in our net liability for unrecognized tax obligations  or record a change to the balance of retained earnings  as a result of the adoption of fin upon adoption of fin  we elected to follow an accounting policy to classify accrued interest related to liabilities for income taxes within the interest expense line and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the other expense line of our consolidated statements of income see note for more details 
fair value of financial instruments carrying amounts of certain financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable trade and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the relatively short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization 
the fair value of our total long term debt approximates its carrying value 
financial instruments and hedge accounting we follow the provisions of fasb sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended sfas 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending upon whether the derivative is part of a hedge transaction and meets specific hedge accounting criteria 
refer to notes and for details relating to the accounting for financial instruments and hedging activities 
restructuring charges we record restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other exit costs in accordance with sfas sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to incur a liability pursuant to sfas  our management must have established and approved a plan of restructuring in sufficient detail 
a liability for a cost associated with involuntary termination benefits is recorded when benefits have been communicated and a liability for a cost to terminate an operating lease or other contract is incurred when the contract has been terminated in accordance with the contract terms or we have ceased using the right conveyed by the contract  such as vacating a leased facility 

table of contents we record restructuring charges relating to employee termination costs in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for post employment benefits sfas 
sfas applies to post employment benefits provided to employees under ongoing benefit arrangements 
in accordance with sfas  we record such charges when the termination benefits are capable of being determined or estimated in advance  from either the provisions of our policy or from past practices  the benefits are attributable to services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires us to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities  including estimating sub lease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances 
refer to note for details relating to our restructuring charges 
litigation we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
share based payment on july   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee share based compensation arrangements under the provisions of fasb  sfas revised and share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transitional method 
previously  we had elected to account for employee share based compensation using the intrinsic value method based upon accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
the intrinsic value method generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
under the modified prospective transitional method  share based compensation is recognized for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
in addition  share based compensation is recognized  subsequent to the adoption of sfas r  for the remaining portion of the vesting period if any for outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption 
we measure share based compensation costs on the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award 
we have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period  which in our circumstances is the stated vesting period of the award  provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested 
compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is adjusted in the period once actual forfeitures are known 
refer to note for details of stock options and share based compensation costs 
accounting for pensions  post retirement and post employment benefits pension expense  based upon management s assumptions  consists of actuarially computed costs of pension benefits in respect of the current year of service  imputed returns on plan assets for funded plans  and imputed interest on pension obligations 
the expected costs of post retirement benefits  other than pensions  are accrued in the financial statements based upon actuarial methods and assumptions 
the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans are recognized as an asset or a liability with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity  respectively  on the balance sheet 
refer to note for details relating to our pension plans

fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations immediately upon the acquisition of hummingbird  we restructured both hummingbird and pre acquisition open text operations into one combined organization 
sales forces were aligned and all back office functions such as accounting and information technology were consolidated to manage the combined operations 
our research and development teams quickly prepared integration code to combine products and features between previous hummingbird and open text products 
most former hummingbird executive management and many next levels of management personnel were terminated  and primarily open text management assumed all responsibilities for sales  service  research and development  and general and administrative activities 
in view of the shared resources  single line management and combined operations  presentation of the results of operations of open text and hummingbird separately is  we believe  not meaningful and therefore not articulated within this discussion and analysis

fiscal year fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter customer support revenue consists of revenue from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenue is generated from such support and maintenance agreements relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
as our installed base grows  the renewal rate has a larger influence on customer support revenue than the current software revenue growth 
therefore changes in customer support revenue do not necessarily correlate directly to the changes in license revenue in a given period 
typically the term of these support and maintenance agreements is twelve months  with customer renewal options 
new license sales create additional customer support agreements which contribute substantially to the increase in our customer support revenue

table of contents special charges recoveries typically relate to monies that we expect to pay on account of restructuring plans relating to employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities  impairment of long lived assets and other non recurring charges 
generally  we implement such plans in the context of streamlining existing open text operations that get impacted by significant acquisitions such as hummingbird 
actions related to such restructuring plans are  more often than not  completed within a period of one year 
in certain limited situations if the planned activity does not need to be implemented  or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out  we record a recovery of the originally recorded expense to special charges 
restructuring plans relating to legacy employee workforce reduction and abandonment of legacy excess facilities of the acquired company are not included within special charges  but are accounted for as part of the cost of the acquisition  unless such charges relate to additional accruals recorded after the purchase price allocation period 
the reduction in special charges in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the fact that the major actions connected to our fiscal restructuring plan were already complete as of the end of our fiscal and we did not implement any new restructuring plans during fiscal net interest expense is primarily made up of cash interest paid on our debt facilities and the unrealized gain loss on our interest rate collar  offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our million long term debt obtained in october  the term loan  for the purpose of partially financing our hummingbird acquisition 
the term loan bears floating rate interest at libor plus a fixed rate which is currently set at per annum 
in addition  as required by the lenders of the term loan  we also entered into an interest rate collar the collar which enclosed the floating portion of our interest rate obligations associated with a portion of the term loan  within an upper limit of and a lower limit of 
we account for the collar as a derivative instrument that is marked to market  with the changes in fair value being charged to interest expense in the period to which such changes relate 
this change in value is the theoretical or unrealized gain loss on the interest rate collar and reflects the change in the fair value of the collar between reporting periods 
throughout fiscal  interest rates declined  while this has favorably impacted our cash interest payments  it also significantly increased the negative fair value of our collar  as the valuation of the collar is influenced by current and expected future interest rates 
it is important to note  however  that as the collar approaches maturity in december the negative fair value that is being seen now will eventually unwind and the value of the collar will trend back up to nil or even a positive value if interest rates start moving upwards 
if interest rates continue to move downwards we will likely have to continue to make cash payments on the collar  equivalent to the difference between the lower range of the collar and libor applied to the hedged portion of the term loan 
to date  since entering into the agreement  we have made net payments of million on the collar 
although we are not able to predict future changes in the fair value of the collar with certainty  or the amount that we expect to pay or receive in future quarters  we expect to see its fair value approach nil as the collar approaches its contractual maturity 
net interest expense increased by million primarily due to i an increase in the unrealized loss on the fair value of the collar of million  ii an increase in the amount paid on the collar of million  iii an increase in tax related interest expense of million  and iv an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs of million 
these increases were offset by higher interest income earned of million  as the result of a larger pool of investable cash in the current fiscal year and lower interest paid on the long term debt of million 
the remaining increase in interest expense is due to miscellaneous items 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relate primarily to our term loan  as we had no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit as of june  as of june   we had an outstanding balance of million on the term loan 
the term loan bears a floating interest rate of libor plus a fixed rate of 
as of june   an adverse change in libor of basis points would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the term loan by approximately million  absent the impact of our interest rate collar referred to below and assuming that the loan balance as of june   is outstanding for the entire period 
we manage our interest rate exposure  relating to million of the above mentioned term loan  with an interest rate collar that partially hedges the fluctuation in libor 
the collar has a notional value of million  a cap rate of and a floor rate of 
this has the effect of circumscribing our maximum floating interest rate risk within the range of to 
the collar expires in december as of june   the fair value of the collar was a payable in the amount of million 
foreign currency risk our reporting currency is the u 
s dollar 
on account of our international operations  a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents is held in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of june   this balance represented approximately of our total cash and cash equivalents 
a adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar would have decreased our reported cash and cash equivalents by approximately 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from subsidiaries  other than those located in the u 
s  are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
these functional currencies include euros  canadian dollars  swiss francs and british pounds 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the foreign currency conversion of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income loss for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income loss will increase for our international operations  if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
we cannot predict the effect foreign exchange fluctuations will have on our results going forward 
however  if there is a change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar  it could have a material effect on our results of operations
