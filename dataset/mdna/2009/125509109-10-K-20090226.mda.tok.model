in addition  the company has an international operation that offers life  accident and supplemental health insurance products as well as international health care products and services to businesses and individuals in selected markets 
the company also has certain inactive businesses  including a run off reinsurance segment 
ongoing operations the company generates revenues  net income and cash flow from ongoing operations by maintaining and growing its customer base  charging prices that reflect emerging experience  investing available cash at attractive rates of return for appropriate durations  and effectively managing other operating expenses 
the company s ability to increase revenue  net income and operating cash flow is directly related to its ability to address broad economic and industry factors and execute its strategic initiatives  the success of which is measured by certain key factors as discussed below 

table of contents key factors affecting the company s results from ongoing operations include the ability to profitably price products and services at competitive levels  the volume of customers served and the mix of products and services purchased by those customers  the ability to cross sell its various health and related benefit products  the relationship between other operating expenses and revenue  and the effectiveness of the company s capital deployment initiatives 
run off operations effectively managing the various exposures of its run off operations is important to the company s ongoing profitability  operating cash flows and available capital 
the results are influenced by a range of economic factors  especially movements in equity markets and interest rates 
results are also influenced by behavioral factors  including partial surrender election rates for gmdb contracts and annuity election rates for gmib contracts  as well as the collection of amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires

table of contents initiatives to lower operating expenses the company has undertaken several initiatives to realign its organization and consolidate support functions in an effort to increase efficiency and responsiveness to customers and to reduce costs 
in  the company conducted a comprehensive review of its ongoing businesses with an emphasis on reducing operating expenses in the health care segment 
as a result of the review  during the fourth quarter of  the company committed to a plan to reduce operating costs in order to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the current economic environment 
the company anticipates the plan will be substantially complete by the end of as a result  the company recognized in other operating expenses a total charge of million pre tax million after tax  which included million pre tax million after tax for severance and other related costs resulting from reductions of approximately  positions in its workforce and million pre tax million after tax resulting from consolidation of facilities

table of contents overview of consolidated results of operations income from continuing operations for the year ended december  declined significantly compared with  as a result of the following the run off reinsurance segment reported substantial losses in  primarily due to losses in the guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib and guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb businesses  reflecting the deterioration in the financial markets and also  for gmib  the effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
see the run off reinsurance section of the md a beginning on page for additional information 
the company reported significant net realized investment losses in primarily due to impairments caused largely by the deterioration in the financial markets 
these losses were partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate 
see the investment assets section of the md a beginning on page for more information 
the company s results in were also negatively affected by the special charges for litigation and cost reduction matters discussed beginning on page these factors were partially offset by higher segment earnings in each of the company s ongoing operating segments health care  disability and life  and international 
overview of consolidated results of operations excluding the special items discussed above  income from continuing operations decreased in  compared with  principally reflecting lower realized investment gains primarily due to lower gains from sales of equity interests in real estate limited liability entities of million 
these factors were partially offset by higher earnings in the health care see page  disability and life see page  international see page and run off reinsurance see page segments 
outlook for the company expects income from continuing operations  excluding realized investments results  the results of the gmib business  and special items  to be higher than due to overall earnings growth in the ongoing operating segments  as well as lower losses in the run off reinsurance segment 
this outlook includes an assumption that results of the gmdb business will be approximately break even for full year this assumption reflects management s view that the long term reserve assumptions are appropriate and that equity market conditions and volatility will return to more normal levels in the company s outlook is subject to the factors cited in the cautionary statement and the sensitivities discussed in the critical accounting estimates section of the md a on pages through if the unfavorable equity market and interest rate movements continue  the company could experience additional losses related to the gmdb business 
information is not available for management to reasonably estimate the future results of the gmib business  realized investment gains losses  or to identify or reasonably estimate special items in however  if unfavorable equity market and interest rate movements continue  the company could also experience additional losses related to the gmib business and investment impairments 
potential losses related to the gmdb and gmib businesses  as well as investment impairments  could adversely impact the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition  and could reduce the capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries as well as their dividend paying capabilities

see segment reporting discussions for additional detail and drivers 

table of contents premiums and fees increased in  compared with  primarily attributable to higher specialty revenues and growth in medical membership as well as strong renewal pricing on existing business in the health care segment and strong business growth in the disability and life and international segments 
net investment income net investment income decreased in  compared with primarily due to lower yields driven by declines in short term interest rates  commercial mortgage pre payment fees  and income from security partnerships 
net investment income decreased in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower average assets due to share repurchase activity and a decline in the health care segment average invested assets resulting from a shift in business from guaranteed cost products to administrative services only aso products  and pre funding of medicare part d claims 
mail order pharmacy revenues mail order pharmacy revenues increased in  compared with due to increased script volume and rate increases

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table  there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits other than those identified in the following table  as well as estimates with respect to goodwill  unpaid claims and claim expenses  postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions  certain compensation accruals  and income taxes 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact the company 
balance sheet caption assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used nature of critical accounting estimate future policy benefits guaranteed minimum death benefits these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the guaranteed death benefit over the values of contractholders accounts 
the death benefit coverage in force at december  representing the amount payable if all of approximately  contractholders had died as of that date was approximately billion 
liabilities for future policy benefits for these contracts as of december were as follows in millions the company estimates these liabilities based on assumptions for lapse  partial surrender  mortality  interest rates mean investment performance and discount rate  and volatility 
these assumptions are based on the company s experience and future expectations over the long term period 
the company monitors actual experience to update these estimates as necessary 
lapse refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to a contractholder s death 
partial surrender refers to the fact that most contractholders have the ability to withdraw substantially all of their mutual fund investments while retaining any available death benefit coverage in effect at the time of the withdrawal 
once a partial surrender is made  the liability increases reflecting lower future assumed premiums  a lower likelihood of lapsation  and a lower likelihood of account values recovering sufficiently to reduce the death benefit exposure in future periods 
these effects are not covered by the company s gmdb equity hedge program 
market declines could expose the company to higher amounts of death benefit exposure that can be retained by contractholders subsequent to a significant partial surrender and to higher election rates of future partial surrenders 
thus  if equity markets decline  the company s liability for partial surrenders increases and there is no corresponding offset from the hedge program 
the election rate for expected future partial surrenders is updated quarterly based on emerging experience 
interest rates include both a the mean investment performance assumption considering the company s gmdb equity hedge program which reflects the average short term interest rate to be earned over the life of the program  and b the liability discount rate assumption 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if an unfavorable change were to occur to those assumptions  the approximate after tax decrease in net income would be as follows increase in mortality rates million decrease in lapse rates million increase in election rates for future partial surrenders million basis point decrease in interest rates mean investment performance million discount rate million increase in volatility million as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying equity mutual funds declined by due to equity market performance  the after tax decrease in net income resulting from an increase in the provision for partial surrenders would be approximately million 
as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying bond money market mutual funds declined by due to bond money market performance  the after tax decrease in net income resulting from an increase in the provision for partial surrenders and an increase in unhedged exposure would be approximately million 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 

table of contents balance sheet caption assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used nature of critical accounting estimate volatility refers to the degree of variation of future market returns of the underlying mutual fund investments 
health care medical claims payable medical claims payable for the health care segment include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported 
liabilities for medical claims payable as of december were as follows in millions gross  net gross  net these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables 
these liabilities generally exclude amounts for administrative services only business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company develops estimates for health care medical claims payable using actuarial principles and assumptions based on historical and projected claim payment patterns  medical cost trends  which are impacted by the utilization of medical services and the related costs of the services provided unit costs  benefit design  seasonality  and other relevant operational factors 
the company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each reporting period  with consideration given to the variability of these factors  and recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence  as required by actuarial standards of practice  which require that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
the company s estimate of the liability for medical claims incurred but not yet reported is primarily calculated using historical claim payment patterns and expected medical cost trends 
the company analyzes the historical claim payment patterns by comparing the dates claims were incurred  generally the dates services were provided  to the dates claims were paid to determine completion factors  which are a measure of the time to process claims 
a completion factor is calculated for each month of incurred claims 
the company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors 
the company estimates the ultimate liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of completion factors to the current paid claims data 
the difference between this estimate of the ultimate liability and the current paid claims data is the estimate of the remaining claims to be paid for each incurral month 
these monthly estimates are aggregated and included in the company s health care medical claims payable at the end of each reporting period 
completion factors are used to estimate the health care medical claims payable for all months where claims have not been completely resolved and paid  except for the most recent month as described below 
completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in the level of claims processed electronically versus manually auto adjudication  changes in provider claims submission rates  membership changes and the mix of products 
as noted  the company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors 
this approach implicitly assumes that historical completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current period 
it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and net income 
claims incurred in the most recent month have limited paid claims data  since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to the company for payment in the month services have been provided 
this makes the completion factor approach less reliable for claims incurred in the most recent month 
as a result  in any reporting period  for the estimates of the ultimate claims incurred in the most recent month  the company primarily relies on medical cost trend analysis  which reflects expected claim payment patterns and other relevant operational considerations 
medical cost trend is impacted by several key factors including medical service utilization and unit costs and the company s ability to for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions  resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable of of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended december  for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions  resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims  or of the current year incurred claims reported for the year ended december  specifically  the favorable impact is due to faster than expected completion factors and lower than expected medical cost trends  both of which included an assumption for moderately adverse experience 
the corresponding impact of favorable prior year development on net income was million for the year ended december  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in the company s net income 

table of contents balance sheet caption assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used nature of critical accounting estimate manage these factors through benefit design  underwriting  provider contracting and the company s medical management initiatives 
these factors are affected by changes in the level and mix of medical benefits offered  including inpatient  outpatient and pharmacy  the impact of copays and deductibles  changes in provider practices and changes in consumer demographics and consumption behavior 
because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends  the trend experienced for the most recent history along with an analysis of emerging trends  have been taken into consideration in establishing the liability for medical claims payable at december  and it is possible that the actual medical trend for the current period will develop differently from the expected  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and net income 
for each reporting period  the company evaluates key assumptions by comparing the assumptions used in establishing the medical claims payable to actual experience 
when actual experience differs from the assumptions used in establishing the liability  medical claims payable are increased or decreased through current period net income 
additionally  the company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends which may impact key assumptions 
the estimation process involves considerable judgment  reflecting the variability inherent in forecasting future claim payments 
the adequacy of these estimates is highly sensitive to changes in the company s key assumptions  specifically completion factors  which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the submission and payment of medical claims  and medical cost trends  which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the utilization of medical services and unit costs 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and other assets guaranteed minimum income benefits these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the expected value of the income benefit over the value of the annuitants accounts at the time of annuitization 
the assets associated with these contracts represent receivables in connection with reinsurance that the company has purchased from two external reinsurers  which covers of the exposures on these contracts 
as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements  the company implemented sfas no 
 fair value measurements  on january  at adoption  the company was required to change certain assumptions 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million after tax  net of reinsurance million pre tax 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company updated assumptions to reflect those that the company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current exit price 
the company estimates a hypothetical market participant s view of these assumptions considering market observable information  the actual and expected experience of the company  and other relevant and available industry sources 
resulting changes in fair value are reported in gmib expense 
the company considers the various assumptions used to estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities associated with those contracts in two categories 
the first group of assumptions used to estimate these fair values consist of capital market inputs including market returns and discount rates  claim interest rates and market volatility 
interest rates include a market returns  b the liability discount rate assumption and c the projected interest rates used to calculate the reinsured income benefit at the time of annuitization claim interest rate 
volatility refers to the degree of variation of future market returns of the underlying mutual fund investments 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company s results of operations are expected to be more volatile in future periods because these assumptions will be based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each period including interest rates and market implied volatilities 
if an unfavorable change were to occur in these assumptions  the approximate after tax decrease in net income  net of estimated amounts receivable from reinsurers  would be as follows basis point decrease in interest rates which are aligned with libor used for projecting market returns and discounting million basis point decrease in interest rates used for projecting claim exposure year treasury rates million increase in implied market volatility million 
table of contents balance sheet caption assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used nature of critical accounting estimate during  the company increased its assumption related to annuity election rates and decreased its lapse assumption resulting in a charge net of reinsurance of million pre tax million after tax 
liabilities related to these contracts as of december  were as follows in millions as of december  estimated amounts receivable related to these contracts from two external reinsurers  were as follows in millions the second group of assumptions consists of future annuitant behavior including annuity election rates  lapse  and mortality  retrocessionaire credit risk  and a risk and profit charge 
annuity election rates refer to the proportion of annuitants who elect to receive their income benefit as an annuity 
lapse refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to annuitization of the policy 
credit risk refers to the ability of these reinsurers to pay 
risk and profit charge refers to the amount that a hypothetical market participant would include in the valuation to cover the uncertainty of outcomes and the desired return on capital 
decrease in mortality million increase in annuity election rates million decrease in lapse rates million decrease in amounts receivable from reinsurers credit risk million increase to the risk and profit charge million market declines which reduce annuitants account values expose the company to higher potential claims which results in a larger net liability 
if annuitants account values as of december  declined by due to the performance of the underlying mutual funds  the approximate after tax decrease in net income  net of estimated amounts receivable from reinsurers  would be approximately million 
all of these estimated impacts due to unfavorable changes in assumptions could vary from quarter to quarter depending on actual reserve levels  the actual market conditions or changes in the anticipated view of a hypothetical market participant as of any future valuation date 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables in run off reinsurance collectibility of reinsurance recoverables requires an assessment of risks that such amounts will not be collected  including risks associated with reinsurer default and disputes with reinsurers regarding applicable coverage 
gross and net reinsurance recoverables in the run off reinsurance segment as of december  were as follows in millions gross  net gross  net the amount of reinsurance recoverables in the run off reinsurance segment  net of reserves  represents management s best estimate of recoverability  including an assessment of the financial strength of reinsurers 
a reduction of net reinsurance recoverables due to uncollectibility at december   would reduce net income by approximately million after tax 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities pension liabilities these liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and nonqualified pension benefits to be paid attributed to employee service to date net of the fair value of plan assets 
the accrued pension benefit liability as of december was as follows in millions the company estimates these liabilities with actuarial models using various assumptions including discount rates and an expected long term return on plan assets 
discount rates are set by applying actual annualized yields at various durations from the citigroup pension liability curve  without adjustment  to the expected cash flows of the pension liabilities 
the expected long term return on plan assets for the domestic qualified pension plan is developed considering actual historical returns  expected long term market conditions  plan asset mix and management s investment strategy 
in addition  to measure pension costs the company uses a market related asset value method for domestic qualified pension plan assets invested in non fixed income investments  which are approximately of total plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns in the non fixed income portfolio over years  a method that reduces the short term impact of market fluctuations on pension cost 
using past experience  the company expects that it is reasonably possible that a favorable or unfavorable change in these key assumptions of basis points could occur 
an unfavorable change is a decrease in these key assumptions with resulting impacts as discussed below 
if discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased by basis points see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
annual pension costs for would increase by approximately million  after tax  and the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million as of december  if the expected long term return on domestic qualified pension plan assets decreased by basis points  annual pension costs for would 
table of contents balance sheet caption assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used nature of critical accounting estimate the significant decline in value of equity securities during has resulted in an accumulated unrecognized actuarial loss of billion at december  the actuarial loss is adjusted for unrecognized changes in market related asset values and amortized over the remaining service life of pension plan participants if the adjusted loss exceeds of the market related value of plan assets or of the projected benefit obligation  whichever is greater 
as of december   approximately billion of the adjusted actuarial loss exceeded of the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  approximately million after tax will be expensed in net income 
for the year ended december   million after tax was expensed in net income 
increase by approximately million  after tax 
if the december  fair values of domestic qualified plan assets decreased by  the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million 
a favorable change is an increase in these key assumptions and would result in impacts to annual pension costs  the accrued pension liability and shareholders equity in an opposite direction  but similar amounts 
investments fixed maturities recognition of losses from other than temporary impairments of public and private placement fixed maturities losses for other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities must be recognized in net income based on an estimate of fair value by management 
changes in fair value are reflected as an increase or decrease in shareholders equity 
a decrease in fair value is recognized in net income when the decrease is determined to be other than temporary 
determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary includes an evaluation of the reasons for and the significance of the decrease in value of the security as well as the duration of the decrease 
management estimates the amount of an other than temporary impairment when a decline in value is expected to persist  using quoted market prices for public securities with active markets and generally the present value of future cash flows for private placement bonds and other public securities 
expected future cash flows are based on historical experience of the issuer and management s expectation of future performance 
see quality ratings in the investment assets section of the md a beginning on page for additional information 
the company recognized other than temporary impairments of investments in fixed maturities as follows in millions  after tax see note a to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s review of declines in fair value 
for all fixed maturities with cost in excess of their fair value  if this excess was determined to be other than temporary  the company s net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million after tax 
for private placement bonds considered impaired  a decrease of of all expected future cash flows for the impaired bonds would reduce net income by approximately million after tax

run off reinsurance segment segment description the company s reinsurance operations were discontinued and are now an inactive business in run off mode since the sale of the us individual life  group life and accidental death reinsurance business in this segment is predominantly comprised of guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb  also known as vadbe  guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib  workers compensation and personal accident reinsurance products 
the determination of liabilities for gmdb and gmib requires the company to make critical accounting estimates 
the company has updated the assumptions for gmib and the effects of hypothetical changes in those assumptions in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
the company describes the assumptions used to develop the reserves for gmdb and the assets and liabilities for gmib and provides the effects of hypothetical changes in those assumptions in the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page results of operations in millions financial summary premiums and fees net investment income other revenues segment revenues benefits and expenses loss before income tax benefits income tax benefits segment loss realized investment gains losses  net of taxes results of gmib business after tax included in segment earnings loss charge on adoption of sfas no 
for gmib contracts results of gmib business excluding charge on adoption segment losses for the year included losses from the gmib business of million  and losses from the gmdb business of million 
excluding the charge on adoption of sfas no 
for the gmib business  see note b to the consolidated financial statements these losses were primarily related to declines in equity markets and interest rates and increased market volatility 
excluding the results of the gmib and gmdb businesses  segment earnings for run off reinsurance were lower in than  reflecting reduced favorable settlement activity related to personal accident and workers compensation 
excluding the results of the gmib business  segment earnings improved in compared with the improvement was predominantly due to an increase in earnings from several settlements and commutations that were favorable to the company s reserve position at the time  as well as higher earnings in the workers compensation and personal accident business  resulting from more favorable claim development 
other revenues other revenues included pre tax gains from futures contracts used in the gmdb equity hedge program see note to the consolidated financial statements of million in  compared with pre tax losses of million in and million in amounts reflecting corresponding changes in liabilities for gmdb contracts were included in benefits and expenses consistent with gaap when a premium deficiency exists see below other benefits and expenses 
the notional amount of the futures contract positions held by the company at december  related to this program was billion 

table of contents benefits and expenses benefits and expenses were comprised of the following in millions for the years ended december  gmib expense other benefits and expenses benefits and expenses gmib expense 
gmib expense in includes a pre tax charge of million for the adoption of sfas no 
 which is discussed in notes b and to the consolidated financial statements 
gmib expense in includes a pre tax charge of million related to updated assumptions for annuity election and lapse rates 
with the adoption of sfas no 
in  the company s results of operations are expected to be more volatile in future periods both because the liabilities  net of receivables from reinsurers  are larger and because these assumptions will be based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each reporting period including interest rates libor swap curve and market implied volatilities 
excluding the charge on adoption of sfas no 
 the gmib business generated additional pre tax expense of million in primarily as a result of decreases in interest rates since december  million  the impact of declines in underlying account values in the period  driven by declines in equity markets and bond fund returns  resulting in increased exposure million  updates to the risk and profit charge estimate million  updates to other assumptions that are used in the fair value calculation million  and other amounts including the compounding effects of declines in interest rates and equity markets  as well as experience varying from assumptions million 
excluding the charge to update assumptions for annuity election and lapse rates  the gmib business generated additional pre tax expense of million in  primarily the result of unfavorable annuitization and lapse experience 
the gmib liabilities and related assets are calculated using a complex internal model and assumptions that in are from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
this resulting liability and related asset is higher than the company believes will ultimately be required to settle claims primarily because market observable interest rates are used to project growth in account values of the underlying mutual funds to estimate fair value from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
the company s payments for gmib claims are expected to occur over the next to years and will be based on actual values of the underlying mutual funds and the year treasury rate at the dates benefits are elected 
the company does not believe that current market observable interest rates reflect actual growth expected for the underlying mutual funds over that timeframe  and therefore believes that the recorded liability and related asset do not represent what management believes will ultimately be required as this business runs off 
however  the significant decline in financial markets during has had an unfavorable impact on the gmib business 
significant declines in mutual fund values that underlie the contracts increasing the exposure to the company together with declines in the year treasury rate used to determine claim payments increased the expected amount of claims that will be paid out for contractholders who choose to annuitize while these conditions continue 
it is also possible that these unfavorable market conditions will have an impact on the level of contractholder annuitizations  particularly if these unfavorable market conditions persist for an extended period 
other benefits and expenses 
during  the company recorded additional other benefits and expenses of million million after tax primarily to strengthen gmdb reserves following an analysis of experience and reserve assumptions 
these amounts were primarily due to adverse impacts of overall market declines of million million after tax 
this includes a million million after tax related to the provision for partial surrenders  including million million after tax for an increase in the assumed election rates for future partial surrenders and b million million after tax related to declines in the values of contractholders non equity investments such as bond funds  neither of which is included in the gmdb equity hedge program  adverse volatility related impacts due to turbulent equity market conditions 
volatility risk is not covered by the gmdb equity 
table of contents hedge program 
also  the equity market volatility  particularly during the second half of the year  impacted the effectiveness of the hedge program 
in aggregate  these volatility related impacts totaled million million after tax 
the gmdb equity hedge program is designed so that changes in the value of a portfolio of actively managed futures contracts will offset changes in the liability resulting from equity market movements 
in periods of equity market declines  the liability will increase  the program is designed to produce gains on the futures contracts to offset the increase in the liability 
however  the program will not perfectly offset the change in the liability  in part because the market does not offer futures contracts that exactly match the diverse mix of equity fund investments held by contractholders  and because there is a time lag between changes in underlying contractholder mutual funds  and corresponding changes in the hedge position 
in  the impact of this mismatch was higher than most prior periods due to the relatively large changes in market indices from day to day 
in addition  the number of futures contracts used in the program is adjusted only when certain tolerances are exceeded and in periods of highly volatile equity markets when actual volatility exceeds the expected volatility assumed in the liability calculation  losses will result 
these conditions have had an adverse impact on earnings  and during  the increase in the liability due to equity market movements was only partially offset by the results of the futures contracts  and adverse interest rate impacts 
interest rate risk is not covered by the gmdb equity hedge program  and the interest rate returns on the futures contracts were less than the company s long term assumption for mean investment performance generating an additional million million after tax 
in addition to the reserve strengthening discussed above  other benefits and expenses were higher in than due to the impact of changes in the equity markets on gmdb contracts 
equity markets decreased significantly in while they increased in leading to higher benefits expense in equity market declines result in decreases in underlying annuity account values  which increases the exposure under the contracts 
these changes in benefits expense are partially offset by futures gains and losses  discussed in other revenues above 
in addition  benefits expense related to personal accident and workers compensation was higher in than  as a result of reduced favorable settlement activity in other benefits and expenses were lower in  compared with  due to lower expense in the workers compensation and personal accident businesses  due to the impact of favorable claim experience and settlements and commutations that were favorable to the company s reserved position 
this was partially offset by higher benefits expense for the guaranteed minimum death benefit business  as improvements in equity markets for were smaller than in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and reserve balances related to gmdb 
segment summary the company s payment obligations for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company under these contracts are based on ceding companies claim payments 
for gmdb and gmib  claim payments vary because of changes in equity markets and interest rates  as well as mortality and policyholder behavior 
for workers compensation and personal accident  the claim payments relate to accidents and injuries 
any of these claim payments can extend many years into the future  and the amount of the ceding companies ultimate claims  and therefore the amount of the company s ultimate payment obligations and corresponding ultimate collection from retrocessionaires may not be known with certainty for some time 
the company s reserves for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company  as well as for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires  are considered appropriate as of december   based on current information 
however  it is possible that future developments  which could include but are not limited to worse than expected claim experience and higher than expected volatility  could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company bears the risk of loss if its payment obligations to cedents increase or if its retrocessionaires are unable to meet  or successfully challenge  their reinsurance obligations to the company

extreme volatility in credit or equity market conditions may reduce the company s ability to issue debt or equity securities 
significant volatility and deterioration of the equity markets during has resulted in reduced retained earnings and has reduced the capital available for growth  acquisitions  and share repurchase 

table of contents on march   the company entered into a new commercial paper program the program 
under the program  the company is authorized to sell from time to time short term unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum of million 
the proceeds are used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases 
the company uses the credit facility described below as back up liquidity to support the outstanding commercial paper 
if at any time funds are not available on favorable terms under the program  the company may use the credit agreement see below for funding 
in october  the company added an additional dealer to its program 
as of december   the company had million in commercial paper outstanding  at a weighted average interest rate of  used to finance the great west healthcare acquisition and for other corporate purposes 
on march   the company issued million of notes with an effective interest rate of per year 
interest is payable on march and september of each year beginning september  the proceeds of this debt were used for general corporate purposes  including financing the acquisition of great west healthcare 
these notes will mature on march  the company may redeem these notes  at any time  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  or the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments on the notes being redeemed discounted at the applicable treasury rate plus basis points 
in june  the company amended and restated its five year committed revolving credit and letter of credit agreement for billion  which permits up to billion to be used for letters of credit 
this agreement is diversified among banks  with three banks each having of the commitment and the other banks having the remaining of the commitment 
the credit agreement includes options  which are subject to consent by the administrative agent and the committing banks  to increase the commitment amount up to billion and to extend the term of the agreement 
the company entered into the agreement for general corporate purposes  including support for the issuance of commercial paper and to obtain statutory reserve credit for certain reinsurance arrangements 
there was a million letter of credit issued as of december  liquidity and capital resources outlook at december   there was approximately million in cash available at the parent company level 
in  the parent company s debt service consists of scheduled interest payments of approximately million on outstanding long term debt of billion at december  and approximately million of commercial paper that will mature over the next three months 
there are no scheduled long term debt repayments in the company expects to refinance the commercial paper either by issuing long term debt or re issuing commercial paper 
the company s best estimate is that contributions to the qualified pension plan will be approximately million pre tax during the parent company expects to fund the million pre tax contribution with subsidiary contributions equal to gaap expense and parent company tax benefits 
however  this amount could change based on final valuation amounts and the level at which the company decides to fund the plan 
the parent company would fund the estimated remaining million net after tax contribution with ongoing parent company cash sources including  but not limited to  subsidiary dividends 
these estimates do not include funding requirements related to the litigation matter discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as management does not expect this matter to be resolved in future years contributions will ultimately be based on a wide range of factors including but not limited to asset returns  discount rates  and funding targets 
the availability of resources at the parent company level is partially dependent on dividends from the company s subsidiaries  most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions and rating agency capital guidelines  and partially dependent on the availability of liquidity from the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the company expects  based on current projections for cash activity  to have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations 
however  the company s cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings  regulatory restrictions or rating agency capital guidelines reduce the amount of dividends available to be distributed to the parent company from the insurance and hmo subsidiaries including the impact of equity market deterioration and volatility on subsidiary capital  continued significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets reduces the company s ability to raise capital or 
table of contents creates unexpected losses related to the gmdb and gmib businesses  a substantial increase in funding over current projections is required for the company s pension plan  or a substantial increase in funding is required for the company s gmdb equity hedge program 
in those cases  the company expects to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures  including intercompany borrowings and sales of liquid investments 
the parent company may borrow up to million from connecticut general life insurance company without prior state approval 
in addition  the company may use short term borrowings  such as the commercial paper program and the committed line of credit agreement of up to billion subject to the maximum debt leverage covenant in its line of credit agreement 
as of december   the company had an additional million of borrowing capacity within the maximum debt leverage covenant in the line of credit agreement in addition to the billion of debt outstanding as of december  though the company believes it has adequate sources of liquidity  continued significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect the company s ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds 
solvency regulation many states have adopted some form of the national association of insurance commissioners naic model solvency related laws and risk based capital rules rbc rules for life and health insurance companies 
the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held  the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred 
if the ratio of the insurer s adjusted surplus to its risk based capital falls below statutory required minimums  the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 
in addition  various non us jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency  liquidity and reserve coverage measures 
during  the company s hmos and life and health insurance subsidiaries  as well as non us insurance subsidiaries  were compliant with applicable rbc and non us surplus rules 
in  the naic adopted actuarial guideline vacarvm  which will be effective december  vacarvm will impact statutory and tax reserves for cigna s gmdb and gmib contracts 
upon implementation  it is anticipated that statutory reserves for these contracts will increase and thus statutory surplus for connecticut general life insurance company will be reduced 
the magnitude of any impact depends on equity market and interest rate levels at the time of implementation 
guarantees and contractual obligations the company  through its subsidiaries  is contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business 
the maturities of the company s primary contractual cash obligations  as of december   are estimated to be as follows less in millions  on an than after undiscounted basis total year years years years on balance sheet insurance liabilities contractholder deposit funds future policy benefits health care medical claims payable unpaid claims and claims expenses short term debt long term debt non recourse obligations other long term liabilities off balance sheet purchase obligations operating leases total 
table of contents on balance sheet insurance liabilities 
contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities  excluding unearned premiums and fees  represent estimated net benefit payments for health  life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts 
recorded contractholder deposit funds reflect current fund balances primarily from universal life customers 
contractual cash obligations for these universal life contracts are estimated by projecting future payments using assumptions for lapse  withdrawal and mortality 
these projected future payments include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees 
actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity  mortality  lapse  withdrawal  investment and premium experience 
the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of billion recorded on the balance sheet because the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting  charges and fees 
the company manages its investment portfolios to generate cash flows needed to satisfy contractual obligations 
any shortfall from expected investment yields could result in increases to recorded reserves and adversely impact results of operations 
the amounts associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses are excluded from the table above as net cash flows associated with them are not expected to impact the company 
the total amount of these reinsured reserves excluded is approximately billion 
short term debt represents commercial paper and current obligations under capital leases 
long term debt includes scheduled interest payments 
capital leases are included in long term debt and represent obligations for software licenses 
nonrecourse obligations represent principal and interest payments due which may be limited to the value of specified assets  such as real estate properties held in joint ventures 
other long term liabilities 
these items are presented in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
this table includes estimated payments for gmib contracts  pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations  supplemental and deferred compensation plans  interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts  and certain tax and reinsurance liabilities 
estimated payments of million for deferred compensation  non qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year 
the company s best estimate is that contributions to the qualified domestic pension plan during will be approximately million 
this amount could change based on final valuation amounts and the level at which the company decides to fund the plan 
the company expects to make payments subsequent to for these obligations  however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions which may materially differ from actual activities see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the above table also does not contain million of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions because the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of their resolution with the respective taxing authorities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for further information 
off balance sheet purchase obligations 
as of december   purchase obligations consisted of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements for future services and investment commitments as follows in millions fixed maturities commercial mortgage loans real estate limited liability entities other long term investments total investment commitments future service commitments total purchase obligations 
table of contents the company had commitments to invest in limited liability entities that hold real estate or loans in real estate entities or securities 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
future service commitments include an agreement with ibm for various information technology it infrastructure services 
the company s remaining commitment under this contract is approximately million over a year period 
the company has the ability to terminate this agreement with days notice  subject to termination fees 
the company s remaining estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and it maintenance and support 
the company generally has the ability to terminate these agreements  but does not anticipate doing so at this time 
purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty or those that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased 
operating leases 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
guarantees the company  through its subsidiaries  is contingently liable for various financial guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees 
share repurchase the company maintains a share repurchase program  which was authorized by its board of directors 
decisions to repurchase shares depend on market conditions and alternative uses of capital 
the company has  and may continue from time to time  to repurchase shares on the open market through a rule b plan which permits a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
the company repurchased million shares in for million and million shares in for billion 
the total remaining share repurchase authorization as of february   was million 
investment assets the company s investment assets do not include separate account assets 
additional information regarding the company s investment assets and related accounting policies is included in notes    and to the consolidated financial statements 
fixed maturities investments in fixed maturities bonds include publicly traded and privately placed debt securities  mortgage and other asset backed securities  preferred stocks redeemable by the investor and trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities include hybrid securities 
fair values are based on quoted market prices when available 
when market prices are not available  fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality 
in instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments  the company estimates fair value using methods  models and assumptions that the company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price 
the company performs ongoing analyses on prices to conclude that they represent reasonable estimates of fair value 
this process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by the company s investment professionals 
this process also includes review of pricing methodologies  pricing statistics and trends and backtesting recent trades 

table of contents the company s fixed maturity portfolio continues to be diversified by issuer and industry type  with no single industry constituting more than of total invested assets as of december  in millions federal government and agency state and local government foreign government corporate federal agency mortgage backed other mortgage backed other asset backed total other mortgage backed assets consist principally of commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of which million were residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit  all of which were originated utilizing standard underwriting practices and are not considered sub prime loans 
quality ratings as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturities in the company s investment portfolio were investment grade baa and above  or equivalent  and the remaining billion were below investment grade 
most of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum 
private placement investments are generally less marketable than public bonds  but yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly offered debt with comparable credit risk 
the fair value of private placement investments was billion as of december  and the company maintains controls on its participation in private placement investments 
in particular  the company performs a credit analysis of each issuer  diversifies investments by industry and issuer and requires financial and other covenants that allow the company to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength so the company can take remedial actions  if warranted 
see the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page for additional information 
because of the higher yields and the inherent risk associated with privately placed investments and below investment grade securities  gains or losses from such investments could affect future results of operations 
however  since management matches the duration of assets to the duration of liabilities  it expects to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term and therefore  does not expect such gains or losses to be material to the company s liquidity or financial condition 
commercial mortgage loans the company s commercial mortgage loans are made exclusively to commercial borrowers  therefore there is no exposure to either prime or sub prime residential mortgages 
these fixed rate loans are diversified by property type  location and borrower to reduce exposure to potential losses 
loans are secured by the related property and are generally made at less than of the property s value 
the company routinely monitors and evaluates the status of its commercial mortgage loans by reviewing loan and property related information  including cash flows  expiring leases  financial health of the borrower and major tenants  loan payment history  occupancy and room rates for hotels and market conditions 
the company evaluates this information in light of current economic conditions as well as geographic and property type considerations 
problem and potential problem investments problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by days or more or have been restructured as to terms interest rate or maturity date 
potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current no payment more than days past due  but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 
these characteristics include  but are not limited to  the following request from the borrower for restructuring  principal or interest payments past due by more than but fewer than days  downgrade in credit rating  deterioration in debt service ratio  collateral losses on asset backed securities  and 
table of contents significant vacancy in commercial rental mortgage property  or a decline in sales for commercial retail mortgage property 
the company recognizes interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment 
the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant in  or the following table shows problem and potential problem investments at amortized cost as of december in millions gross reserve net problem bonds potential problem bonds potential problem commercial mortgage loans problem bonds potential problem bonds potential problem commercial mortgage loans foreclosed real estate the company sold its remaining foreclosed property and did not acquire any properties through foreclosure in summary the company recorded after tax realized investment losses for investment asset write downs and changes in valuation reserves as follows in millions credit related other total other primarily represents the impact of rising interest rates on investments where the company cannot demonstrate the intent and ability to hold until recovery 
in addition to these asset write downs  in  the company recognized after tax losses of million on hybrid securities classified as equity securities of certain quasi federal government agencies where the company believes that the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the us and global financial markets experienced significant challenges throughout the unprecedented downgrading of billions of dollars of previously highly rated  liquid public securities led to a significant crisis of confidence and a dramatic tightening of credit conditions leading to historically wide credit spreads and substantially higher market yields in spite of near record low treasury rates 
both debt and equity markets are expected to remain volatile until confidence is restored 
as a result of this economic environment  the credit risks in the company s investment portfolio are elevated 
the market conditions described above resulted in a significant net increase in investment yields across the credit spectrum 
while this increase is positive for new investments  it drove a significant decline in value for the company s existing investment portfolio 
the company s corporate fixed maturity and commercial mortgage loan portfolios are well diversified by borrower  sector  and geographic region  limiting exposure 
however  if broad economic conditions and or illiquidity in the capital markets persist or worsen  this would likely result in an increase in the severity and duration of the decline in asset values  and may cause the company to experience additional investment losses 
the value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio declined substantially throughout resulting in after tax unrealized depreciation of million 
the company s commercial mortgage portfolio also declined substantially in  resulting in after tax unrealized depreciation of million a decline in fair value versus carrying value 
the possibility of increased market investment yields for an extended period could cause the company to recognize impairment losses if it cannot demonstrate the intent and ability to hold certain 
table of contents investments until recovery 
future realized and unrealized investment results will be impacted largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date 
these future conditions are not reasonably predictable 
management believes that a significant portion of the company s fixed maturity and commercial mortgage investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms  and that the recent declines in their fair values are temporary 
based on the company s strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities  it has both the intent and ability to hold these assets to recovery 
therefore  future credit related losses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity or financial condition 
market risk financial instruments the company s assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed rate  domestic  medium term instruments 
changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and impact the value of liabilities for reinsured gmdb and gmib contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar to the south korean won  taiwan dollar  euro  hong kong dollar  british pound  and thai bhat 
an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
equity price risk for domestic equity securities and for gmdb and gmib contracts resulting from unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values based on underlying mutual fund investments 
for further discussion of reinsured contracts  see note for gmdb contracts and note for gmib contracts in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management of market risks the company predominantly relies on three techniques to manage its exposure to market risk investment liability matching 
the company generally selects investment assets with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of its related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that the company can match the investments to its obligations 
shorter term investments support generally shorter term life and health liabilities 
medium term  fixed rate investments support interest sensitive and health liabilities 
longer term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long term disability liabilities 
use of local currencies for foreign operations 
the company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies 
while this technique does not reduce the company s foreign currency exposure of its net assets  it substantially limits exchange rate risk to net assets 
use of derivatives 
the company generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks and enhance investment returns 
see notes c and f to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments 
effect of market fluctuations on the company the examples that follow illustrate the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including hypothetical changes in market interest rates primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans  partially offset by liabilities for long term debt and gmib contracts  hypothetical changes in market rates for foreign currencies  primarily for the net assets of foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency  and hypothetical changes in market prices for equity exposures primarily for equity securities and gmib contracts 
in addition  hypothetical effects of changes in equity indices and foreign exchange rates are presented separately for futures contracts used in the gmdb equity hedge program 

table of contents management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions  changes in the fair values of all insurance related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk  changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets have been excluded  consistent with the disclosure guidance  and changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill  deferred acquisition costs  taxes  and various accrued liabilities have been excluded  because they are not financial instruments  their primary risks are other than market risk 
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of the company s financial instruments  subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities  would have been as follows as of december market scenario for certain non insurance financial instruments loss in fair value basis point increase in interest rates million million strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies million million decrease in market prices for equity exposures million million the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates on the fair value of certain of the company s financial instruments decreased in as a result of increased net liabilities for gmib contracts  along with declining fair values of fixed maturities  partially offset by a decrease in the duration of long term debt 
net liabilities for gmib contracts increased in primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
and declines in the equity markets and interest rates 
during  the underlying equity account values from gmib contracts decreased by primarily due to equity market declines 
therefore  the current effect of a hypothetical decrease in market prices for equity exposures at december  is expected to be less than at december  see the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page for further discussion of guaranteed minimum income benefits 
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling and  for gmib contracts  stochastic modeling 
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by the company was estimated to be of the us dollar equivalent fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was estimated based on a decrease in the equity mutual fund values underlying guaranteed minimum income benefits reinsured by the company and a decrease in the value of equity securities held by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company uses futures contracts as part of a gmdb equity hedge program to substantially reduce the effect of equity market changes on certain reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum death benefits based on unfavorable changes in underlying variable annuity account values 
the hypothetical effect of a increase in the s p  s p  russell  nasdaq  topix japanese  eurostoxx and ftse british equity indices and a weakening in the us dollar to the japanese yen  british pound and euro would have been a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of the futures contracts outstanding under this program as of december  a corresponding decrease in liabilities for gmdb contracts would result from the hypothetical increase in these equity indices and weakening in the us dollar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this program and related gmdb contracts 
as noted above  the company manages its exposures to market risk by matching investment characteristics to its obligations 
stock market performance the performance of equity markets can have a significant effect on the company s businesses  including on risks and exposures associated with gmdb see note to the consolidated financial statements and gmib contracts see note to the consolidated financial statements  and pension liabilities since equity securities comprise a significant portion of the assets of the company s employee pension plans
