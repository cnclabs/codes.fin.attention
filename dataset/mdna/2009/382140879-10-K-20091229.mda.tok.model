item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below for further details of the above transaction 
as reported on the form k filed on january   we are in default of certain technical loan covenants on our note payable to wells fargo bank  na the bank 
therefore the amount owing under this facility is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of september  we have never been in payment default on the note and expect to be able to remain current on payments in fiscal  depending however on our sales trends and cash flow from operations 
on february  we received a reservation of rights letter from the bank formally notifying us of the default of the earnings before interest taxes and depreciation ebitda coverage ratio of not less than to and the tangible net worth of not less than  as set forth in the credit agreement for the period ending december  the letter serves as notice that in light of the foregoing events of default  the bank is reserving all of its rights and remedies under the credit agreement and related agreements 
the bank is not accelerating the loan at this time and is continuing to accept regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest under the loan  however the acceptance of payments under the loan does not constitute a modification of the credit agreement or a waiver of any of the covenants or of the bank s rights or remedies under the credit agreement  including the right to accelerate the loan in the future after the giving of notice 
we will continue to work with the bank on a required corrective action for compliance with existing or modified loan covenants 
there can be no assurance that the bank will in the future agree to modify or waive any of the loan covenants or waive any of its rights or remedies under the credit agreement and we require additional financing to repay the loan balance 
the loan is secured by security agreements covering the equipment of four restaurants 
in december we granted permission for a north dakota franchisee to terminate their good times franchise agreements in our dual brand concept with taco john s international and effective december one wyoming dual brand franchise agreement was also terminated 
our dual brand test agreement expired in september by mutual agreement 
however  one additional franchised dual brand restaurant opened in december in sheridan  wyoming 
in august we announced the suspension of development of good times restaurants under a development agreement with zen partners llc  in which david grissen  a significant stockholder and a member of our board of directors  has a ownership interest 
no restaurants have been developed under the agreement 
we may reevaluate expansion discussion with zen partners llc as conditions impacting our sales trends  the macroeconomic environment and credit markets may change 
concept and business strategy we operate with two different formats that have evolved over the course of our history a smaller  square foot double drive thru building focused on drive thru service and limited walk up service  and a newer  to  square foot  seat dining room format that is the model for future stores 
we are currently further refining the prototype design to reduce development costs and improve the return on investment model for company owned and franchised restaurant expansion with a  square foot  seat dining room design that will carry forward all of the core design elements of our prior prototype design 
in light of the last two years sales declines that began at the start of the current economic recession  we are primarily focused on regaining positive growth in our existing stores sales 
during the last year we have upgraded the quality and portions of our core hamburger and chicken products  introduced new products  run several different promotions discounting our premium products  reduced the price of our most popular hamburger item and introduced everyday values in both our core and fountain menus with price points from to 
while our primary value proposition for the consumer is derived from the quality and taste of our products  the current competitive and consumer spending environment continues to redefine value expectations within the hamburger quick service restaurant segment and a larger number of transactions are being driven by the availability of menu items at an even lower price point of and below 
we plan to become more competitive for consumers through re engineering smaller menu items at lower price points rather than focus on discounting premium products that are our iconic go to for menu items 
the lower priced menu items will still be consistent with our quality brand position offering fresh  all natural  made to order products available only at good times 
while we do not anticipate a menu  we are testing and plan to implement lower price points for the increasingly value conscious customer 
we believe we have effective premium and mid tier priced menu offerings  but need to strengthen our offerings for customers that want smaller portions and lower price options 
we are continuing to implement every possible quality enhancement to our core menu in burgers  chicken  fries and fountain products to anchor our quality leadership in the quick service restaurant industry 
we have been testing fresh  hand cut fries for over six months and are in the process of rolling them out system wide to replace our seasoned  battered wild fry 
we have found that our wild fry  while unique  for many customers limits their frequency of use of good times 
our new fresh  hand cut fries are unique to qsr in our market and will be supported by our marketing campaign of get back to what s good we also have several other new products in development that will be unique to good times and we will continue to focus on innovation within our current menu categories as well as very selective innovation in products with broad appeal for added variety 
the core of our brand position is to continue to offer the highest quality  best tasting burgers  fries frozen custard available in the quick service restaurant segment 
our core strategies have not changed and we continue to focus on the following initiatives to regain positive sales growth focus on our most important drivers of success o values 
we strive to build and develop behaviors and expectations around what we value most throughout the company integrity  continued improvement  customer loyalty and respect for each other 
o people 
beginning with our operating partner program  people are our strongest asset 
we seek to hire high quality people throughout and provide them with comprehensive training programs to ensure that we deliver consistently superior products and service 
o distinctive quality 
we strive to offer unique  highly distinctive tastes with the highest quality ingredients available in the quick service restaurant category 
o excellent systems 
we strive to provide the best systems and processes in every area to free our management to focus on leading their people 
offer high quality  unique menu items that provide exceptional value 
our restaurants feature menu items that are unique in the quick service segment  and flavor profiles that are associated more with casual theme restaurants than with fast food 
whenever possible  products support the brand umbrella of fresh  high quality ingredients such as fresh frozen custard made fresh throughout the day in every restaurant  all natural coleman beef  fresh squeezed lemonade  grilled honey cured bacon  sliced bermuda onions and toppings such as real guacamole  grilled pineapple and saut ed mushrooms 
each menu category has signature recipes with fun  irreverent names that build good times non traditional personality such as wild fries with wild dippin sauce  big daddy bacon cheeseburger  mighty deluxe  burnin buffalo chicken and cappuccino mocha joe  raspberry torte and strawberry cheesecake addiction custard spoonbenders 
we have made significant changes to our entire menu to leverage our heritage of quality products and to position the good times brand for a more unique and highly differentiated consumer experience 
those product and system changes include the following a 
the introduction of fresh  never frozen  all natural  purebred angus beef for all of our burgers 
the beef is certified humanely raised  has never had antibiotics or growth hormones and is vegetarian fed 
b 
increased the size of our hamburger patties by approximately on a new split top  sponge baked bun that is heavier with increased portions of fresh produce 
c 
reduced the price for our core deluxe burger and deluxe cheeseburger for a stronger value proposition 
d 
established a new fresh grilled  honey cured bacon burger category with new flavor profiles 
e 
reworked our chicken category with breast meat sandwiches and tenders with revised flavor profiles that are unique to fast food 
f 
tested  validated and are rolling out fresh  hand cut fries cut fresh daily from whole idaho russet potatoes 
g 
we will continue to raise the sales and promotional activity of our fountain category of fresh squeezed lemonades  fresh frozen custard treats  shakes and floats 
h 
we are retraining team members in every restaurant on every position with new standards 
establish a unique brand position in quick service restaurants 
we aspire to have good times stand for providing food the way it used to be 
good times is bringing real food back to fast food with pure  wholesome food that tastes the way food used to taste 
key brand support for that will include attributes such as fresh  all natural  fresh grilled  authentic  homemade  and fresh squeezed with a theme of fresh ingredients and hand crafted food 
continually improve our fast  friendly  personal customer service 
we strive to optimize and personalize the interaction between our employees and customers  particularly at the points of order and payment  to build a reputation as having the friendliest service 
we manage the face to face interaction with our customers through extensive employee screening and hospitality training to ensure their experience is punctuated by attentive  friendly service 
during fiscal we introduced a new online screening and hiring system to reduce our hourly employee turnover and hire for good service attitudes 
additionally  we introduced video training tools for the first time that we believe will enhance consistent execution of our quality standards 
speed of service through our drive thru lanes is important to the consumers need for convenience  but is always secondary to delivering the highest quality product possible 
we monitor each car s service time and have developed incentive programs for management and employees to maintain our quick service standards 
build customer loyalty through a unique brand experience 
in addition to fast friendly service and great tasting products  we strive to maintain clean  safe and appealing facilities with a particular emphasis on well groomed landscaping  freshly painted exteriors and merchandising that highlights the unique product attributes and flavors of our products 
we believe that everything the customer sees  smells  hears and feels influences their overall impression and the reputation of good times and that good times target customer is seeking more out of even a quick service restaurant experience 
build awareness of the good times burgers frozen custard brand 
we believe that good times has built substantial brand equity among our customers and has become known for our quality  service and signature tastes  particularly within the hamburger category 
we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to build that reputation within the hamburger category by continuing to build a stronger overall value proposition and increase awareness of our frozen custard and fountain category 
as capital becomes available to us to build out the colorado market  we plan to increase our media advertising  raising our overall awareness and building a highly differentiated brand personality 
continually improve our employees knowledge and proficiency of our core processes 
our customers experience is driven by the ability of our management and employees to consistently execute clearly defined processes in every area of our business 
we believe that our employees abilities and attitudes are directly related to our ability to provide well designed service  production and operating processes and effective training that allows them to continually learn  improve and succeed 
we train  test  certify and re train all employees and management on all of our core operating and management processes to continually improve levels of proficiency 
current fiscal year initiatives consistently grow same store sales we will continue to focus on comparable restaurant sales driven by increases in guest counts and increases in the average guest check 
same store sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal we hope to increase guest counts later in fiscal through a multi faceted approach to continually improve the good times brand experience for our customers by establishing a more relevant value proposition that is centered on the availability of lower price choices and smaller portions 
implementing fresh cut fries and other new product introductions that are unique to good times 
evolving the good times brand position under a new umbrella of back to real food supported by the marketing campaign s tagline of get back to what s good 
improving our execution on customer service and the delivery of our brand experience through re training of all of our employees on new standards and heightened expectations 
continuing to reinvest in our existing facilities with enhanced landscaping  patios and exterior building finishes to improve the restaurants curb appeal and appearance 
improve our income from operations the quality  portioning and pricing changes to improve our value proposition in fiscal resulted in an increase in our cost of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal we began to see smaller increases in commodity costs later in the year  and our goal is to reduce our overall cost of sales in fiscal  even with the introduction of lower price points for some of our menu items 
we implemented a cumulative total weighted menu price increase of during fiscal and we expect to take modest price increases in fiscal during fiscal  we continued to reduce non service labor hours and reduced our hourly employee turnover from approximately to approximately 
we reduced our general administrative costs by  in fiscal and we are evaluating each restaurant s profitability and may sell or sublease a small number of low volume restaurants during fiscal approximately to of incremental sales changes at each restaurant flow through to income from operations  depending on the level of each restaurant s sales 
as a result  our restaurant operating margins are influenced most significantly from the leveraging or deleveraging of fixed and semi variable expenses along with same store sales increases or decreases 
pursue strategic alternatives as described above  the company has hired mastodon ventures  inc to provide strategic advisory services and explore other strategic alternatives that will further the long term business prospects of the company and provide incremental value to its shareholders 
the strategic advisory services agreement the agreement with mastodon ventures  inc mastodon  provides that mastodon will provide the company with exclusive advisory services related to the possible restructuring of certain lease and debt agreements of the company and the identification of possible additional sources of capital for the company 
the services include but are not limited to assistance with the preparation of information  structuring of a plan  negotiations with potential investors and lenders  preparation of any documents required to be filed with federal and state agencies relating to a restructuring plan and analyzing other strategic alternatives 
expansion strategy and site selection our longer term strategy of becoming a super regional brand in select contiguous markets depends on our ability to reverse our same store sales trends  on the consumer spending environment and on the availability of capital  which is currently limited 
any new development would involve our new prototype restaurant design on sites that are on or adjacent to big box or grocery store anchored shopping centers in high activity and employment areas 
our site selection for new restaurants is oriented toward slightly higher income demographic areas than many of our urban locations and most of our targeted trade areas are in relatively high growth areas of the denver  colorado springs and northern colorado markets 
we lease most of our sites 
when we do purchase and develop a site  we intend to sell the developed site into the sale leaseback market under a long term lease 
our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site  with the decision to buy or lease as a secondary objective 
our site criteria includes a mix of substantial daily traffic  density of at least  people within a three mile radius  strong daytime population and employment base  retail and entertainment traffic generators  good visibility and easy access 
restaurant locations we currently operate and franchise a total of fifty one good times restaurants  of which forty seven are in colorado  with forty two in the denver greater metropolitan area  three in colorado springs  one in grand junction and one in silverthorne 
total denver  co greater metro colorado other idaho wyoming north dakota good times co owned co developed good times franchised dual brand co owned dual brand franchised total december company owned restaurants joint venture restaurants franchise operated restaurants total restaurants in october we opened one new company owned restaurant in firestone  colorado 
in december a wyoming franchisee terminated their good times franchise agreement in the dual brand concept and has stopped selling good times products in one location 
also in december a franchisee opened a new dual brand restaurant in sheridan  wyoming 
in october a franchisee operating a good times restaurant in thornton  colorado terminated their franchise agreement and closed the restaurant 
we anticipate that we may close three low volume franchised restaurants 
menu the menu of a good times burgers frozen custard restaurant is limited to hamburgers  cheeseburgers  chicken sandwiches  french fries  onion rings  fresh squeezed and frozen lemonades  soft drinks and frozen custard products 
each menu item is made to order at the time the customer places the order and is not pre prepared 
the hamburger patty is prepared with specially formulated and seasoned coleman natural beef  served on a inch bun 
coleman was acquired by meyer all natural beef and as of january all of our hamburgers are made from fresh  all natural  pure bred angus beef 
hamburgers and cheeseburgers are garnished with fresh iceberg lettuce  fresh sliced sweet red onions  mayonnaise  mustard  ketchup  pickles and fresh sliced tomatoes 
other specialty hamburger toppings include guacamole  fresh grilled honey cured bacon  and proprietary sauces 
the chicken products include a spiced  battered whole muscle breast patty and a grilled seasoned breast patty  both served with mayonnaise  lettuce and tomatoes  and chicken dunkers  whole breast meat breaded strips 
signature chicken sandwiches include the burnin buffalo  tasty teriyaki  and guacamole chicken 
equipment has been automated and equipped with compensating computers to deliver a consistent product and minimize variability in operating systems 
all natural angus beef is raised without the use of any hormones  antibiotics or animal byproducts that are normally used in the open beef market 
we believe that all natural beef delivers a better tasting product and  because of the rigorous protocols and testing that are a part of the meyer processes  also may minimize the risk of any food borne bacteria related illnesses 
fresh frozen custard is a premium ice cream requiring in excess of butterfat content with a proprietary vanilla blend that is prepared from highly specialized equipment that minimizes the amount of air that is added to the mix and that creates smaller ice crystals than other frozen dairy desserts 
the custard is scooped similarly to hard packed ice cream but is served at a slightly warmer temperature 
the resulting product is smoother  creamier and thicker than typical soft serve or hard packed ice cream products 
good times serves the frozen custard in cups and cones  specialty sundaes and spoonbenders  a mix of custard and toppings  and we anticipate it will continue to become a larger percentage of sales as we continue to develop custard products and awareness 
marketing advertising our marketing strategy focuses on driving comparable restaurant sales through attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers  communicating specific product news and attributes to build strong points of difference from competitors  and communicating a unique  strong and consistent brand 
media is an important component of building good times brand awareness and distinctiveness 
we spent our advertising dollars on both television and radio media during fiscal the colorado market is an expensive media market  so most of our advertising placement is not in prime time but in early and late fringe  prime access and late news time slots 
as we continue to develop more and more distinctiveness to good times brand and increase penetration of the colorado market  we anticipate we will continue to use media advertising to increase overall awareness 
another important component of our marketing efforts is point of sale and on site merchandising 
we rotate new four color product point of purchase displays every other month and support new product introductions with extensive merchandising 
our restaurants with dining rooms have back lit and front lit product displays  table tents and product messaging throughout 
menu boards are kept fresh with new food photography and graphics several times throughout the year 
we plan to redesign and expand the use of our website during fiscal and we use email marketing and social media as a tool to build customer loyalty 
we have a marketing agreement with the pepsi center in denver  colorado to serve and promote good times products in that venue 
operations restaurant management we have developed operating partners in several of our restaurants as we are able to recruit qualified candidates 
we believe that this is a distinct competitive advantage that provides a higher level of service  quality control and stability over time 
the objective of the operating partner program is to have each partner develop a relationship with the employees  the customers and the community at their restaurant and develop an ownership mentality with commensurate rewards as sales increase over a longer period of time 
the program allows an operating partner to earn of a restaurant s improvement in cash flow over an established baseline 
each good times unit employs an operating partner or a general manager  one to two assistant managers and approximately to employees  most of whom work part time during three shifts 
an eight to ten week training program is utilized to train restaurant managers on all phases of the operation 
ongoing training is provided as necessary 
we believe that incentive compensation of our restaurant managers is essential to the success of our business 
accordingly  in addition to a salary  managerial employees may be paid a bonus based upon proficiency in meeting financial  customer service and quality performance objectives tied to a monthly scorecard of measures 
operational systems and processes we believe that we have some of the best operating systems and processes in the industry 
detailed processes have been developed for hourly  daily  weekly and monthly responsibilities that drive consistency across our system of restaurants and performance against our standards within different day parts 
we utilize a labor program to determine optimal staffing needs of each restaurant based on its actual customer flow and demand 
we also employ several additional operational tools to continuously monitor and improve speed of service  food waste  food quality  sanitation  financial management and employee development 
we are moving toward automating and computerizing as many of these systems as possible into an integrated  digital management system 
the order system at each good times restaurant is equipped with an internal timing device that displays and records the time each order takes to prepare and deliver 
the total transaction time for the delivery of food at the window is approximately to seconds during peak times 
we use several sources of customer feedback to evaluate each restaurant s service and quality performance  including an extensive  computerized secret shopper program  customer comment phone line  telephone surveys and web site comments 
additionally  management uses both its own primary consumer research for product development and to determine customer usage and attitude patterns as well as third party market research that evaluates good times performance ratings on several different operating attributes against key competitors 
training we strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of all our employees at all levels and the establishment of  and adherence to  high standards relating to personnel performance  food and beverage preparation and maintenance of our restaurants 
each manager must complete an eight to ten week training program  be certified on several core processes and is then closely supervised to show both comprehension and capability before they are allowed to manage autonomously 
all of our training and development is based upon a train  test  certify  re train cycle around standards and operating processes at all levels 
we conduct a semi annual performance review with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals 
we have a defined weekly and monthly goal setting process around service  employee development  financial management and store maintenance goals for every restaurant 
during fiscal  we implemented video training tools to drive training efficiencies and consistency 
recruiting and retention we seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and operating partners 
we support employees by offering competitive wages and benefits  including a k plan  medical insurance  stock options for regional managers and incentives plans at every level that are tied to performance against key goals and objectives 
we motivate and prepare our employees by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement 
we also provide various other incentives  including vacations  car allowances  monthly performance bonuses and monetary rewards for managers who develop future managers for our restaurants 
in fiscal  we implemented an online screening and hiring tool that has proven to reduce hourly employee turnover 
franchising good times has prepared prototype area rights and franchise agreements  a uniform franchise disclosure document ufdd and advertising material to be utilized in soliciting prospective franchisees 
we seek to attract franchisees that are experienced restaurant operators  well capitalized and have demonstrated the ability to develop one to five restaurants 
we review sites selected for franchises and monitor performance of franchise units 
we are not currently soliciting new franchisees and will not do so until capital becomes more available and we have regained positive same store sales momentum 
we estimate that it will cost a franchisee on average approximately  to  to open a restaurant with dining room seating  including pre opening costs and working capital  assuming the land is leased 
a franchisee typically will pay a royalty of of net sales  an advertising materials fee of at least of net sales  plus participation in regional advertising up to an additional of net sales  or a higher amount approved by the advertising cooperative  and initial development and franchise fees totaling  per restaurant 
among the services and materials which we provide to franchisees are site selection assistance  plans and specifications for construction of the good times burgers and frozen custard restaurants  an operating manual which includes product specifications and quality control procedures  training  on site opening supervision and advice from time to time relating to operation of the franchised restaurants 
after a franchise agreement is signed  we actively work with and monitor our franchisees to ensure successful franchise operations as well as compliance with good times systems and procedures 
during the development phase  we assist in the selection of sites and the development of prototype and building plans  including all required changes by local municipalities and developers 
we provide an opening team of trainers to assist in the opening of the restaurant and training of the employees 
we advise the franchisee on menu  management training  marketing  and employee development 
on an ongoing basis we conduct standards reviews of all franchise restaurants in key areas including product quality  service standards  restaurant cleanliness and sanitation  food safety and people development 
we have entered into thirteen franchise agreements in the greater denver metropolitan area 
thirteen franchise restaurants and nine joint venture restaurants are operating in the denver metropolitan area media market 
good times franchise restaurants also operate in colorado springs and grand junction  colorado and in boise  idaho 
dual branded franchised restaurants operate in gillette and sheridan  wyoming  ft 
collins and windsor  colorado  and bismarck  north dakota 
management information systems financial and management control is maintained through the use of automated data processing and centralized accounting and management information systems that we provide 
sales  labor and cash data is collected daily via a restaurant back office system which gathers data from the restaurant point of sale system 
management receives daily  weekly and monthly reports identifying food  labor and operating expenses and other significant indicators of restaurant performance 
we believe that these reporting systems are sophisticated and enhance our ability to control and manage operations 
food preparation  quality control purchasing we believe that we have some of the highest food quality standards in the quick service restaurant industry 
our systems are designed to protect our food supply throughout the preparation process 
we inspect specific qualified manufacturers and work together with those manufacturers to provide specifications and quality controls 
our operations management teams are trained in a comprehensive safety and sanitation course provided by the national restaurant association 
minimum cook temperature requirements and line checks throughout the day ensure the safety and quality of both burgers and other items we use in our restaurants 
we currently purchase of our restaurant food and paper supplies from yancey s food service 
we do not believe that the current reliance on this sole vendor will have any long term material adverse effect since we believe that there are a sufficient number of other suppliers from which food and paper supplies could be purchased 
we do not anticipate any difficulty in continuing to obtain an adequate quantity of food and paper supplies of acceptable quality and at acceptable prices 
employees at december   we had approximately employees of which are part time hourly employees and are salaried employees working full time 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
competition the restaurant industry  including the fast food segment  is highly competitive 
good times competes with a large number of other hamburger oriented fast food restaurants in the areas in which it operates 
many of these restaurants are owned and operated by regional and national restaurant chains  many of which have greater financial resources and experience than we do 
restaurant companies that currently compete with good times in the denver market include mcdonald s  burger king  wendy s  carl s jr  sonic and jack in the box 
double drive through restaurant chains such as rally s hamburgers and checker s drive in restaurants  which currently operate a total of over double drive through restaurants in various markets in the united states  are not currently operating in colorado 
culver s and freddy s are the only significant competitors offering frozen custard as a primary menu item operating in the denver and colorado springs markets and both have a significant presence in the targeted midwestern markets for expansion 
additional fast casual hamburger restaurants are being developed in the colorado market  such as smashburger and five guys  however  they do not have drive through service and generate an average per person check that is approximately higher than good times 
our management believes that we may have a competitive advantage in terms of quality of product compared to traditional fast food hamburger chains 
early development of our double drive through concept in colorado has given us an advantage over other double drive through chains that may seek to expand into colorado because of our brand awareness and present restaurant locations 
nevertheless  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition and marketing capability 
furthermore  most of our competitors in the fast food business operate more restaurants  have been established longer  and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
there is also active competition for management personnel  as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
trademarks good times has registered its mark good times drive thru burgers sm with the state of colorado 
we have also registered our mark good times burgers frozen custard federally and with the state of colorado 
good times received approval of its federal registration of good times in in addition we own trademarks or service marks that have been registered  or for which applications are pending  with the united states patent and trademark office including but not limited to mighty deluxe  wild fries  spoonbender  chicken dunkers  big daddy bacon cheeseburger  and wild dippin sauce 
our trademarks expire between and government regulation each good times restaurant is subject to the regulations of various health  sanitation  safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located 
difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new good times restaurant 
federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations 
more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime  and other working conditions 
in addition  we are subject to the americans with disabilities act  which requires restaurants and other facilities open to the public to provide for access and use of facilities by the handicapped 
management believes that we are in compliance with the americans with disabilities act 
we are also subject to federal and state laws regulating franchise operations  which vary from registration and disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of franchises to the application of statutory standards regulating franchise relationships

item a 
risk factors 
you should consider carefully the following risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to good times restaurants securities 
you are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive 
going concern 
as shown in the accompanying financial statements  we have incurred operating losses in the current and prior fiscal years and  due to loan covenant defaults  the entire balance of an  note payable to wells fargo bank na is included in current liabilities 
if wells fargo were to accelerate payment of the note payable and if we are not successful in raising additional operating capital  we would not have the ability to satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business 
it is our current objective to raise operating capital through debt and equity offerings  however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the required additional capital 
as a result of the foregoing circumstances  our auditors have expressed in their report on our consolidated financial statements that there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have accumulated losses 
we have incurred losses in every fiscal year since inception except   and as of september  we had an accumulated deficit of  we cannot assure you that we will not have a loss for the current fiscal year ending september  as of september   we had a working capital deficit of  we must sustain same store sales increases 
we must sustain same store sales increases in existing restaurants to sustain profitability and we experienced declines in our same store sales in fiscal and fiscal sales increases will depend in part on the success of our advertising and promotion of new and existing menu items and consumer acceptance 
we cannot assure that our advertising and promotional efforts will in fact be successful 
new restaurants  when and if opened  may not be profitable  if at all  for several months 
we anticipate that our new restaurants  when and if opened  will generally take several months to reach normalized operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants  including lack of market awareness  the need to hire and train a sufficient number of employees  operating costs  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  pre opening costs and other factors 
in addition  restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets  and may have higher restaurant level operating expense ratios than in existing markets 
sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average annual company owned restaurant sales  if at all  thereby affecting the profitability of these restaurants 
our operations are susceptible to the cost of and changes in food availability which could adversely affect our operating results 
our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  governmental regulation  production  availability  recalls of food products and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain 
we enter into annual contracts with our beef and chicken suppliers 
our contracts for chicken are fixed price contracts 
our contracts for beef are generally based on current market prices plus a processing fee 
changes in the price or availability of chicken or beef could materially adversely affect our profitability 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  because we provide a value priced product  we may not be able to pass along price increases to our guests 
the macroeconomic recession could affect our operating results 
the current state of the economy and decreased consumer spending has adversely affected our sales over the last eighteen months and may continue to cause material negative sales trends 
a continued shift in consumer purchases toward value menus  in our competitive segment  and a proliferation of heavy discounting by our major competitors may also continue to negatively affect our sales and operating results 
price increases may impact guest visits 
we may make price increases on selected menu items in order to offset increased operating expenses we believe will be recurring 
although we have not experienced significant consumer resistance to our past price increases  we cannot provide assurance that this or other future price increases will not deter guests from visiting our restaurants or affect their purchasing decisions 
the hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive 
the hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive 
our competitors include many recognized national and regional fast food hamburger restaurant chains such as mcdonald s  burger king  wendy s  carl s jr  sonic  jack in the box and culver s 
we also compete with small regional and local hamburger and other fast food restaurants  many of which feature drive through service 
most of our competitors have greater financial resources  marketing programs and name recognition 
all of the major hamburger chains have increasingly offered selected food items and combination meals at discounted prices and have recently intensified their promotions of value priced meals 
continued discounting by competitors may adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our restaurants 
sites may be difficult to acquire 
location of our restaurants in high traffic and readily accessible areas is an important factor for our success 
drive through restaurants require sites with specific characteristics and there are a limited number of suitable sites available in our geographic markets 
since suitable locations are in great demand  and in the future we may not be able to obtain optimal sites at a reasonable cost 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the sites we do obtain will be successful 
we will require additional financing 
in order to fully develop the denver and colorado springs pueblo markets and to expand into markets outside of colorado  we will require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to access sufficient capital to adequately finance our operations and our planned developments or that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms 
the current economic recession and status of the capital markets may adversely affect our ability to acquire additional debt or equity financing for working capital  new restaurant development  or refinancing of existing funding agreements 
if our franchisees cannot develop or finance new restaurants  build them on suitable sites or open them on schedule  our growth and success may be impeded 
under our current form of area development agreement  some franchisees must develop a predetermined number of restaurants according to a schedule that lasts for the term of their development agreement 
franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open the restaurants required by their development schedules  or may be unable to find suitable sites on which to develop them 
franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites  obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules 
from time to time in the past  we have agreed to extend or modify development schedules and we may do so in the future 
any of these problems could slow our growth and reduce our franchise revenues 
additionally  our franchisees depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing would adversely affect the number and rate of new restaurant openings by our franchisees and adversely affect our future franchise revenues 
our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business 
franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees 
we provide training and support to franchisees  however  franchisees operate their restaurants as independent businesses 
consequently  the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control 
moreover  franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements  or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel 
our image and reputation  and the image and reputation of other franchisees  may suffer materially and system wide sales could significantly decline if our franchisees do not operate successfully 
we depend on key management employees 
we believe our current operations and future success depend largely on the continued services of our management employees  in particular boyd e 
hoback  our president and chief executive officer  and scott lefever  our vice president of operations 
although we have entered into an employment agreement with mr 
hoback  he may voluntarily terminate his employment with us at any time 
in addition  we do not maintain key person insurance on messrs 
hoback s or lefever s life 
the loss of messrs 
hoback s or lefever s services  or other key management personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
labor shortages could slow our growth or harm our business 
our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified  high energy employees 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some areas 
the inability to recruit and retain these individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could harm our business 
additionally  competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
most of our employees are paid on an hourly basis 
the employees are paid in accordance with applicable minimum wage regulations 
accordingly  any increase in the minimum wage  whether state or federal  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevada law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment 
we are subject to anti takeover laws for nevada corporations 
these anti takeover laws prevent a nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with any stockholder  including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder  who owns or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock  for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired or more of the corporation s voting stock  unless specified conditions are met 
our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain a number of provisions that may deter or impede takeovers or changes of control or management 
these provisions authorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock  the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance  do not allow for cumulative voting in the election of directors unless required by applicable law 
under cumulative voting  a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors  state that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board  the president or any two directors  and must be called by the president upon the written request of the holders of ten percent of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such special meeting  and provide that the authorized number of directors is currently set at seven 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to stockholders for their common stock 
future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results and affect our reported results of operations 
changes in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
as an example  in  we adopted the change that requires us to record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee stock options using the fair value method 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or differing interpretations with respect to our current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results 
our nasdaq listing is important 
our common stock is currently listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market 
the nasdaq maintenance rules require  among other things  that our common stock price remains above per share and that we have minimum net tangible assets in excess of million 
we were required to obtain shareholder approval in for a reverse stock split to maintain a sufficient per share price to preserve our nasdaq listing 
we are subject to extensive government regulation that may adversely hinder or impact our ability to govern various aspects of our business including our ability to expand and develop our restaurants 
the restaurant industry is subject to various federal  state and local government regulations  including those relating to the sale of food 
while in the past we have been able to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental licenses  permits and approvals  our failure to maintain these licenses  permits and approvals  including food licenses  could adversely affect our operating results 
difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants 
local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our food licenses if they determine that our conduct does not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations 
various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs 
these laws govern minimum wage requirements  such as those to be imposed by recently enacted legislation in colorado  overtime pay  meal and rest breaks  unemployment tax rates  workers compensation rates  citizenship or residency requirements  child labor regulations and sales taxes 
additional government imposed increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits may increase our operating costs 
the federal americans with disabilities act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment 
although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled  we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to  or make reasonable accommodations for  disabled persons 
we are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor licensee relationship 
many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement  including limitations on non competition provisions and the termination or non renewal of a franchise 
some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in the state 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
keeping abreast of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and the nasdaq market rules  has required an increased amount of management attention and expense 
we remain committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment has resulted in and will continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
accordingly  we are continuing to explore alternatives to reduce the cost burdens of being a publicly held entity 
risks related to internal controls 
public companies in the united states are required to review their internal controls as set forth in the sarbanes oxley act of it should be noted that any system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the system are met 
in addition  the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events 
because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems  there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
if the internal controls put in place by us are not adequate or in conformity with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  we may be forced to restate our financial statements and take other actions which will take significant financial and managerial resources  as well as be subject to fines and other government enforcement actions 
health concerns relating to the consumption of beef  chicken or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations 
like other restaurant chains  consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the avian influenza  also known as bird flu  or the consumption of beef  the key ingredient in many of our menu items  or negative publicity concerning food quality  illness and injury generally  such as negative publicity concerning e 
coli  mad cow or foot and mouth disease  publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us  or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants 
this negative publicity may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants 
if we react to the negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu we may lose guests who do not prefer the new concept or menu  and may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of a concept change and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors 
a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business

results of operations net revenues net revenues for fiscal decreased  to  from  for fiscal same store restaurant sales decreased  or  during fiscal restaurants are included in same store sales after they have been open a full fifteen months and only good times restaurants are included while dual branded restaurants are excluded 
restaurant sales decreased  due to one non traditional company owned restaurant not included in same store sales and increased  due to seven new  acquired or dual branded company owned restaurants that were opened or acquired in fiscal and net revenues decreased  in fiscal due to an increase in franchise fees of  offset by a decrease in franchise royalties of  our same store restaurant sales decline of reflects the adverse impact the macroeconomic environment is having on consumers discretionary spending and the proliferation of heavy promotion of value menus and discounting by competitors 
we had shown same store sales growth in sixteen consecutive quarters leading into the third quarter of fiscal our outlook for fiscal remains cautious as the economic pressures may continue to impact consumer spending and we anticipate that we will continue to face increased competitive pricing pressure 
while we are implementing several broad product and brand initiatives during fiscal to improve our core value proposition  our sales may continue to be adversely affected during the economic recession 
average restaurant sales for company owned and co developed restaurants including double drive thru restaurants and restaurants with dining rooms but excluding dual brand restaurants for fiscal and were as follows fiscal fiscal company operated for factors which may affect future results of operations  please refer to the section entitled current fiscal year initiatives in item on pages of this report and a related discussion of planned product and system changes discussed in the section entitled concept and business strategy in item on pages of this report

in fiscal and our weighted food and packaging costs increased approximately and  respectively 
the cumulative weighted menu price increases taken during fiscal and fiscal were approximately and  respectively 
we anticipate limited price increases in fiscal with continued cost pressure on several core commodities 
payroll and other employee benefit costs for fiscal payroll and other employee benefit costs decreased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
the decrease in payroll and other employee benefit costs for fiscal is partially due to a decrease in restaurant sales 
payroll and benefit costs are semi variable and therefore increase or decrease as sales fluctuate 
additionally we have reduced our labor hours allocation through increased efficiencies and improved our sales per employee hour efficiencies on service hours  thereby eliminating approximately  of annual payroll costs 
the new restaurant which opened in october operated at a higher labor cost as a percent of sales due to higher initial labor costs until it reached mature staffing levels 
the three dual branded restaurants also have a higher labor cost as a percent of sales than good times single brand restaurants 
occupancy and other costs for fiscal  occupancy and other costs decreased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
the  decrease in occupancy and other costs are primarily attributable to increases in building rent of  due to normal rent escalations and the restaurants acquired in fiscal increases in property taxes of  related to valuation increases at existing restaurants and the new and acquired restaurants 
decrease in our accretion for deferred rent of  decreases in restaurant repairs of  primarily due to contract maintenance services 
decreases in utility costs of  related to utility rate decreases

new store pre opening costs for fiscal  new store pre opening costs decreased  from  in fiscal to  new store pre opening costs in fiscal and are related to one new company owned restaurant that opened in october depreciation and amortization costs for fiscal  depreciation and amortization costs decreased  from  in fiscal to  depreciation costs increased due to  of depreciation expense in the three acquired and new company owned restaurants  offset by declining depreciation expense in our aging company owned restaurants 
selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs decreased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs are partially attributable to decreased advertising costs  which decreased to  of restaurant sales for fiscal from  of restaurant sales for fiscal  and a decrease in general and administrative costs  which decreased to  of restaurant sales for fiscal from  of restaurant sales for fiscal as explained below 
the decrease in advertising costs is primarily due to the decrease in restaurant sales  as contributions are made to the advertising materials fund and regional advertising cooperative based on a percentage of sales 
in addition   of payroll and employee benefit costs were eliminated in fiscal due to the retirement of our vice president of marketing in november we currently have no plans to fill the position in the immediate future 
we anticipate that fiscal advertising will consist primarily of television and radio advertising  on site and point of purchase merchandising totaling approximately of restaurant sales 
the  decrease in general and administrative cost is primarily attributable to reductions in payroll and employee benefit costs of  reductions in training and recruiting expenses of  reduction in professional services of  net reductions in various other fixed expenses of  reduction in preliminary site costs related to the omaha  nebraska expansion of  franchise costs for fiscal  franchise costs decreased  from  of total revenues in fiscal to  
of total revenues in fiscal the decrease in franchise costs is primarily attributable to the reduction in payroll and employee benefit costs related to the vice president of franchise development position that was eliminated in july in conjunction with good times exit from the planned midwest expansion 
we incurred  in legal costs in the prior year related to franchise registration filings 
the current year includes a write off of  for legal fees incurred in prior years related to the good times taco john s dual brand franchise agreement 
gain on disposal of restaurants and equipment for fiscal  the gain on disposal of restaurants and equipment decreased  to  from  in fiscal the  gain on disposal of restaurants and equipment in fiscal is primarily related to the partial recognition of deferred gains related to two sale leaseback transactions that were completed in fiscal and income loss from operations the loss from operations was  in fiscal compared to a loss from operations of  in fiscal net income loss net loss was  for fiscal compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the change from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the matters discussed in the net revenues  food and packaging costs  selling  general and administrative costs and franchise costs sections of item in addition  minority interest expense decreased  due to decreased income from restaurant operations of the joint venture restaurants for fiscal  net interest expense increased  in fiscal primarily due to increased borrowings on our pfgi ii  llc line of credit and an  unrealized loss in the current fiscal year related to our interest rate swap liability 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital as of september   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we currently plan to use the cash balance and any cash generated from operations for our working capital needs in fiscal we anticipate that we will require additional working capital of  to  during january through april  and we are pursuing additional sources of funding to increase our working capital 
we are pursuing rent concessions from several of our landlords and anticipate improved income from operations of   from those transactions in fiscal if circumstances require we may contemplate the sale or sublease of selected underperforming restaurants in fiscal in april  we extended the maturity of our  line of credit with pfgi ii  llc to july  and have further extended the maturity to december  as described below see financing below 
as of september   we had a working capital deficit of  due primarily to the entire note payable to wells fargo bank  na of  shown as a current liability due to certain loan covenant defaults that existed as of september  we are not in payment default under the note and anticipate remaining current on all principal and interest payments in fiscal  subject to our successfully raising additional operating capital 
we have received a forbearance and reservation of rights letter from wells fargo bank stating that they are accepting current principal and interest payments and are not currently accelerating the note  subject to agreeing to an acceptable required corrective action for the covenant defaults 
it is unlikely that we will have an acceptable required corrective action until our earnings before interest taxes and depreciation ebitda improves 
if wells fargo were to accelerate the note payable  we would need additional financing and we do not currently have a source for such financing 
additionally  we have recorded an  current liability related to the unrealized loss on our interest rate swap  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in
