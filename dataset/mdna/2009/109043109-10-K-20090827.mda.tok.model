the company is not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plan during fiscal  but may be required to make contributions in future years depending upon the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
management believes that available cash  cash generated from operations and existing lines of credit will be adequate to fund briggs stratton s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
financial strategy management believes that the value of briggs stratton is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that briggs stratton has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that enhance revenues and provide a superior economic return 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  we should return capital to the capital providers through dividends and or share repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements briggs stratton has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
briggs stratton s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and certain employee benefit plans 
briggs stratton is subject to financial and operating restrictions in addition to certain financial covenants under its domestic debt agreements 
as is fully disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  these restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends  incur further indebtedness  create liens  enter into sale 
table of contents and or leaseback transactions  consolidate or merge with other entities  sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets  and dispose of assets or the proceeds of our assets 
we believe we will remain in compliance with these covenants in fiscal briggs stratton has obligations concerning certain employee benefits including its pension plans  postretirement benefit obligations and deferred compensation arrangements 
all of these obligations are recorded on our balance sheets and disclosed more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of june  is as follows in thousands total fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations consulting and employment agreements other matters labor agreement briggs stratton has collective bargaining agreements with its unions 
these agreements expire at various times ranging from emissions the us environmental protection agency epa has developed multiple phases of national emission standards for small air cooled engines 
briggs stratton currently has a complete product offering that complies with the epa s phase ii engine emission standards 
the epa issued proposed phase iii standards in to further reduce engine exhaust emissions and to control evaporative emissions from small off road engines and equipment in which they are used 
the phase iii standards are similar to those adopted by the california air resources board carb 
the phase iii program requires evaporative controls in and go into full effect in for class ii engines cubic centimeter displacement and larger and for class i engines less than cubic centimeter displacement 
briggs stratton does not believe the cost of compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
carb s tier regulation requires additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions and new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 
the tier regulation was fully phased in during fiscal year while briggs stratton believes the cost of the regulation may increase engine costs per unit  briggs stratton does not believe the regulation will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
this assessment is based on a number of factors  including revisions the carb made to its adopted regulation from the proposal published in september in response to recommendations from briggs stratton and others in the regulated category and intention to pass increased costs associated with the regulation on to consumers 
the european commission adopted an engine emission directive regulating exhaust emissions from small air cooled engines 
the directive parallels the phase i and ii regulations adopted by the us epa 
stage was effective in february and stage was phased in between calendar years and  with some limited extensions available for specific size and type engines until briggs stratton has a full product line compliant with stage briggs stratton does not believe the cost of compliance with the directive will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies briggs stratton s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity 
table of contents with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include a goodwill assessment  estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable and inventory reserves  and estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to customer rebates  pension obligations  postretirement benefits  warranty  product liability  litigation and taxation 
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually and when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performs impairment reviews using a fair value method for its reporting units  which have been determined to be one level below the company s reportable segments 
the reporting units are engine  home power products and yard power products 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
to estimate fair value  the company periodically retains independent third party valuation experts 
fair value is estimated using a valuation methodology that incorporates two approaches in estimating fair value including the public guideline company method and the discounted cash flow method 
the determination of fair value requires significant management assumptions and other factors including estimating future sales growth  selling prices and costs  changes in working capital  investments in property and equipment  recent stock price volatility  and the selection of an appropriate weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc used for the engine  home power products and yard power products reporting units were  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit  including the recorded goodwill 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at june  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and as such  no impairment existed 
other intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis 
at june  there was no impairment of intangible assets 
the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal  state and foreign income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal  state and foreign taxing authorities periodically review the company s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded tax related assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of interpretations no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on tax returns 
as such  accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with sfas no  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statements no 
  and r  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these 
table of contents rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance  which is essential in the current volatile market 
actuarial valuations at june  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moody s aa or higher rated bonds  resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows 
a decrease in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  including inflation assumptions and active management of the plan s invested assets  knowing that our investment performance has been in the top decile compared to other plans 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  stockholders equity and related expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the funded status of the company s pension plan is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 
at june  the fair value of plan assets was less than the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
the company is not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plan during fiscal  but may be required to make contributions in future years depending upon the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense or income are also calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the service and interest cost by million 
for pension and postretirement benefits  actuarial gains and losses are accounted for in accordance with gaap
