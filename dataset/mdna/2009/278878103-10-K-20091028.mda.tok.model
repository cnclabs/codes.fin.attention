critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets and contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are derived primarily from the professional and technical services performed by its employees or  in certain cases  by subcontractors engaged to perform on under contracts entered into with our clients 
the revenues recognized  therefore  are derived from our ability to charge clients for those services under the contracts 
the company employs three major types of contracts cost plus contracts  fixed price contracts and time and materials contracts 
within each of the major contract types are variations on the basic contract mechanism 
fixed price contracts generally present the highest level of financial and performance risk  but often also provide the highest potential financial returns 
cost plus contracts present a lower risk  but generally provide lower returns and often include more onerous terms and conditions 
time and materials contracts generally represent the time spent by our professional staff at stated or negotiated billing rates 
fixed price contracts are accounted for on the percentage of completion method  wherein revenue is recognized as project progress occurs 
time and material contracts are accounted for over the period of performance  in proportion to the costs of performance  predominately based on labor hours incurred 
if an estimate of costs at completion on any contract indicates that a loss will be incurred  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss becomes evident 

table of contents the use of the percentage of completion revenue recognition method requires the use of estimates and judgment regarding the project s expected revenues  costs and the extent of progress towards completion 
the company has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenue and contract completion costs 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that completion costs may vary from estimates 
most of our percentage of completion projects follow a method which approximates the cost to cost method of determining the percentage of completion 
under the cost to cost method  we make periodic estimates of our progress towards project completion by analyzing costs incurred to date  plus an estimate of the amount of costs that we expect to incur until the completion of the project 
revenue is then calculated on a cumulative basis project to date as the total contract value multiplied by the current percentage of completion 
the revenue for the current period is calculated as cumulative revenues less project revenues already recognized 
the recognition of revenues and profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates 
such estimates are based on various judgments we make with respect to those factors and are difficult to accurately determine until the project is significantly underway 
for some contracts  using the cost to cost method in estimating percentage of completion may overstate the progress on the project 
for projects where the cost to cost method does not appropriately reflect the progress on the projects  we use alternative methods such as actual labor hours  for measuring progress on the project and recognize revenue accordingly 
for instance  in a project where a large amount of equipment is purchased or an extensive amount of mobilization is involved  including these costs in calculating the percentage of completion may overstate the actual progress on the project 
for these types of projects  actual labor hours spent on the project may be a more appropriate measure of the progress on the project 
the company s contracts with the us government contain provisions requiring compliance with the federal acquisition regulation far  and the cost accounting standards cas 
these regulations are generally applicable to all of the company s federal government contracts and are partially or fully incorporated in many local and state agency contracts 
they limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts subject to the far 
cost plus contracts covered by the far provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from the estimate billed 
most of our federal government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
the company maintains reserves for annual indirect rate submittal adjustments due to far and cas compliance reviews by the federal government which covered fiscal years through the reserve decreased   after tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of a settlement with the federal government 
the federal government settlement positively impacted the company s earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal year by 
per share 
federal government contracts are subject to the far and some state and local governmental agencies require audits  which are performed for the most part by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the dcaa audits overhead rates  cost proposals  incurred government contract costs  and internal control systems 
during the course of its audits  the dcaa may question incurred costs if it believes we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of the far or cas and recommend that our us government financial administrative contracting officer disallow such costs 
historically  we have not experienced significant disallowed costs as a result of such audits 
however  we can provide no assurance that such audits will not result in material disallowances of incurred costs in the future 
the company maintains reserves for cost disallowances on its cost based contracts as a result of government audits 
government audits have been completed and final rates have been negotiated through fiscal year the company has estimated its exposure based on completed audits  historical experience and discussions with the government auditors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  the company may be required to record additional charges for disallowed costs on its government contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments we reduce our accounts receivable and costs and accrued earnings in excess of billings on contracts in process by establishing an allowance for amounts that  in the future  may become uncollectible or unrealizable  respectively 
we determine our estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based on management s judgments regarding our operating performance related to the adequacy of the services performed  the status of change orders and claims  our experience settling change orders and claims and the financial condition of our clients  which may be dependent on the type of client and current economic conditions 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results 
management believes that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not 
our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in 
table of contents existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances  with the help of professional tax advisors 
therefore  we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities 
in july of  fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  an interpretation of sfas fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and reduces the diversity in current practice associated with the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by defining a more likely than not threshold regarding the sustainability of the position
