item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical consolidated financial data and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas in the united states 
we own interests in  net to us producing oil and natural gas wells and we operate of these wells 
in managing our business  we are concerned primarily with maximizing return on our stockholders equity 
to accomplish this goal  we focus on profitably increasing our oil and natural gas reserves and production 
our offshore operations were historically conducted through our subsidiary  bois d arc energy 
bois d arc energy was acquired by stone energy corporation stone in exchange for a combination of cash and shares of stone common stock on august  accordingly  our offshore operations are presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented 
unless indicated otherwise  the amounts in the accompanying tables and discussion relate to our continuing onshore operations 
our future growth will be driven primarily by acquisition  development and exploration activities 
under our current drilling budget  we plan to spend approximately million in for development and exploration activities 
we plan to drill approximately wells net to us in thirty two of 
table of contents these wells will be horizontal wells drilled in our east texas north louisiana operating region 
however  we could increase or decrease the number of wells that we drill depending on oil and natural gas prices 
we do not budget for acquisitions as the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities 
accordingly  our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess d seismic data  impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill 
we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our wells connect to third party purchaser pipelines 
we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors  including the availability of purchasers for the product  the availability and cost of pipelines near our wells  market prices  pipeline constraints and operational flexibility 
accordingly  our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
our operating costs are generally comprised of several components  including costs of field personnel  insurance  repair and maintenance costs  production supplies  fuel used in operations  transportation costs  workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes 
like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of replacing our reserves 
although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset production declines or maintain production at current rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production 
our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  and operating safety 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased  to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused 
the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs  which was million as of december

oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales increased million in to million from million in the increase in our sales is primarily due to a increase in our production combined with stronger oil and natural gas prices in our realized oil price in increased by and our realized natural gas price increased by as compared to the increase in production is primarily a result of our successful drilling activity and the acquisition of producing properties in south texas in december oil and gas operating expenses 
our oil and gas operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million to million in from million in oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced increased to as compared to in the increase in operating costs is due to the start up of new wells and higher production and ad valorem taxes due to increased oil and gas prices 
exploration expense 
in  we incurred million in exploration expense as compared to million in exploration expense in primarily relates to one dry hole drilled  the impairment of unevaluated leases and the acquisition of seismic data 
exploration expense in included costs for four dry holes  leasehold impairments and costs incurred for seismic data acquisition 
dd a 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased million to million in from million in this increase resulted from our increase in production in as compared to and an increase in our average dd a rate from to per mcfe produced 
the increase in the average dd a rate results from the higher finding costs associated with our property acquisitions and exploration and development activities in and and downward revisions to our proved reserves due to the lower realized oil and natural gas prices on december  
table of contents impairment of oil and gas properties 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million in and million in the impairments in and relate to fields where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows attributable to the fields estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements  increased million in to million from million in the increase primarily reflects higher personnel costs resulting from increased hiring to support our operating activities and an increase of million in stock based compensation in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in and the capitalization of interest related to our unevaluated properties on which we are conducting exploration activity 
the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility decreased to in as compared to in we capitalized interest of million in which reduced interest expense 
no interest was capitalized in average borrowings under our bank credit facility increased to million in as compared to million for impairment of marketable securities 
we received shares of common stock of stone from the sale of bois d arc energy which were initially valued at million 
subsequent to august  the market value of the stone shares declined significantly 
we recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of based upon our assessment that this decline is other than temporary 
income taxes 
income tax expense related to continuing operations increased by million to million in from million for higher income tax expenses in are primarily due to our higher income 
our effective tax rate of for continuing operations in was comparable to our effective tax rate in of income from continuing operations 
we reported income from continuing operations of million in  as compared to million for the income per diluted share from continuing operations for was on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million as compared to for on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million 
the higher income from continuing operations in results from higher oil and gas sales reflecting increased production and significantly higher oil and natural gas prices received 
higher revenues were only partially offset by higher operating costs  dd a expense and general and administrative expense 
impairments of million in reduced our income from continuing operations by million 
income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in as compared to million in the increase in income from discontinued operations in reflects the higher oil and gas prices in offset in part by higher operating and exploration expenses of the offshore operations 
also included in income from discontinued operations in is a net gain  after income taxes  of million as a result of the sale of our interest in bois d arc energy

oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales increased million in to million from sales of million in this increase primarily reflects a increase in production and higher prices for crude oil and natural gas in prices for crude oil increased by in as compared to our average natural gas price increased by in as compared to the higher production in was primarily due to our successful drilling activity 
oil and gas operating expenses 
our oil and gas operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million to million in from operating expenses of million in oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced decreased to as compared to in the increase in operating costs reflects the start up of new wells and higher production taxes due to increased oil and gas prices 
exploration expense

exploration expense in includes costs for two exploratory dry holes and seismic costs 
dd a 
dd a increased million to million in from dda expense of million in our dd a rate per mcfe produced averaged in as compared to for dd a increased due to higher production and an increase in the amortization rate caused by higher finding costs related to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million in as compared to impairment expense of million in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements  of million for were higher than general and administrative expenses of million for the increase primarily reflects higher personnel costs in due to increased staffing necessary to support our exploration and development activities and an increase of million in stock based compensation in as compared to 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in from interest expense of million in the increase was primarily the result of higher outstanding borrowings and higher average interest rates in average borrowings under our bank credit facility increased to million in as compared to million for the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility increased to in as compared to in derivative gains and losses 
we had no derivative instruments outstanding in we did not designate our derivatives we utilized as part of our price risk management program in as cash flow hedges and accordingly  we recognize gains or losses for the changes in the fair value of these liabilities during each period 
the fair value of our liability for these derivatives decreased during resulting in a net unrealized gain of million 
we realized losses to settle derivative positions of million in income taxes 
income tax expense from continuing operations decreased in to million from million in due to our lower pre tax income in our effective tax rate of in was comparable to our effective tax rate of in income from continuing operations 
we reported income from continuing operations of million for as compared to million for the income per diluted share from continuing operations for was on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million as compared to for on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million 
higher revenues in were offset by higher operating expenses and interest expense 
income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations of million in was million higher than income from discontinued operations of million during the increase in income from discontinued operations in reflect the higher oil and gas prices in offset  in part  by higher operating and exploration expenses of the offshore operations 
liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by our operating cash flow  debt or equity financings or asset dispositions 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million 
our other primary source of funds in was the after tax proceeds of million from the disposition of assets  including sale of our offshore operations 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million 
our other primary source of funds in was a net increase of million under our bank credit facility 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million and we also increased the amount outstanding under our bank credit facility by million 
our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations in increased by million to million as compared to million in primarily due to higher revenues which were attributable to our increased production and higher oil and natural gas prices 
our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations in increased by million to million as compared to million in primarily due to our higher revenues which were attributable to our increased production 
our primary need for capital  in addition to funding our ongoing operations  relates to the acquisition  development and exploration of our oil and gas properties  and the repayment of our debt 
in  we reduced the amount outstanding under our bank credit facility by million  primarily by using the proceeds from our asset sales 
our capital expenditures in of million decreased by million from capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in included million for acquisitions of producing properties 
we had no acquisitions in in  we spent million to acquire 
table of contents unevaluated acreage primarily relating to the exploration of the haynesville shale formation 
capital expenditures in increased by million over capital expenditures of million primarily due to increased acquisition and drilling activity 
our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands exploration and development acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties developmental leasehold costs development drilling exploratory drilling workovers and recompletions other total the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments except for contracted drilling services 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
we currently expect to spend approximately million for development and exploration projects in  which will be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities and  to a lesser extent  by borrowings under our bank credit facility 
our operating cash flow and  therefore  our capital expenditures are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices and  in particular  natural gas prices 
we spent million and million on acquisitions during and  respectively 
our acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties in included the acquisition of certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets from swepi lp  an affiliate of shell oil company for million in december and the acquisition of additional working interests in the javelina field in hidalgo county in south texas for million in june these acquisitions were funded with borrowings under our bank credit facility 
we did not make any acquisitions during concurrent with the december acquisition  we entered into a transaction structured as a reverse like kind exchange in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
in connection with this reverse like kind exchange  we assigned the right to acquire ownership in the oil and gas properties that were acquired from swepi lp to an exchange accommodation titleholder 
we operated these properties pursuant to lease and management agreements 
because we were the primary beneficiary of these arrangements  the properties acquired were included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and we include all revenues earned and expenses incurred related to the properties in our results of operations during the term of the agreements 
we completed the exchange with the sale of certain properties in and the acquired properties were transferred to us from the exchange accommodation titleholder 
the taxable gain from these property sales was deferred as a result of the reverse like kind exchange 
we do not have a specific acquisition budget for because the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
smaller acquisitions will generally be funded from operating cash flow 
with respect to significant acquisitions  we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facility  or other debt or equity financings to the extent available  to finance such acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates  
table of contents oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions 
lack of access to the debt or equity markets due to general economic conditions could impede our ability to complete acquisitions 
cash flows from discontinued operations in of million include the cash proceeds received from sale of our offshore operations of million less the payment of income taxes associated with this transaction of million 
cash used by discontinued operations in and of million and million  respectively  reflect additional investments by us in the offshore operations in each of those years 
we have a million bank credit facility with bank of montreal  as the administrative agent 
the bank credit facility is a five year revolving credit commitment that matures on december  indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by all of our and our subsidiaries assets and is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
the bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability  which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
as of december  the borrowing base was million  million of which was available 
the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  at our option at either libor plus to or the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus to 
a commitment fee of to  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  is payable on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
the bank credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends in excess of million  limit the amount of consolidated debt that we may incur and limit our ability to make certain loans and investments 
the only financial covenants are the maintenance of a ratio of current assets  including the availability under the bank credit facility  to current liabilities of at least one to one and maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  we have million of senior notes outstanding 
the senior notes are due march  and bear interest at  which is payable semiannually on each march and september the senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and future growth as contemplated under our current business plan 
however  if our plans or assumptions change or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital  or if such capital is available  that we will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
the following table summarizes our aggregate liabilities and commitments by year of maturity thereafter total in thousands bank credit facility senior notes interest on debt operating leases natural gas transportation agreements contracted drilling services 
table of contents future interest costs are based upon the interest rate on our outstanding senior notes and on the december  rate for our bank credit facility 
we have obligations to incur future payments for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties 
these payments are currently estimated to be incurred primarily after we record a separate liability for the fair value of these asset retirement obligations which totaled million as of december  impact of recession and current credit and capital markets the united states and other countries are currently in a recession which could last through and beyond 
additionally  the credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility  and many financial institutions have liquidity concerns  prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit markets 
we believe we are well positioned to conduct business in the current economic climate because we operate a majority of our wells  giving us control over the timing of our operations costs and capital expenditures  and we have a conservative balance sheet 
our primary exposure to the current credit market crisis is our bank credit facility 
our bank credit facility is committed in the amount of million until december  as of december   the borrowing base was million  million of which was available 
our borrowing base is adjusted semiannually 
our borrowing base may be adversely impacted if oil and natural gas prices remain low and continue to decline 
if not extended  the bank credit facility matures on december  there are indications that further consolidation will occur within the banking industry  which could result in some of the financial institutions that participate in our bank credit facility merging into or being acquired by other banks 
we cannot predict what  if any  impact any such transactions might have on our current bank credit facility 
in addition  we have million of senior notes outstanding that are due march  if the credit markets do not improve  future extensions of our bank credit facility or any refinancing of our senior notes may be on terms and conditions that are less favorable than the current terms 
crude oil and natural gas prices are also volatile as evidenced by their significant decline during the fourth quarter of which has continued into early lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows from operations 
depending on the length of the current recession  oil and natural gas prices may stay depressed or decline further  thereby causing a prolonged downturn  which would further reduce our cash flow from operations 
this decline could cause us to modify our business plans  including reducing or delaying our exploration and development program and other capital expenditures 
federal taxation we follow fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  in our accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions 
we have analyzed our filing positions in all jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns for the open tax years in such jurisdictions 
our federal income tax returns for the years subsequent to december  remain subject to examination 
our federal income tax return for the year ended december  is currently under examination by the internal revenue service 
our income tax returns in major state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for various periods subsequent to december  we currently believe that all significant filing positions are highly certain and that all of our significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon audit 
therefore  we have no significant reserves for uncertain tax positions and no adjustments to such reserves were required upon adoption of fin interest and penalties resulting from audits by tax authorities have been immaterial and are included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents at december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we have established a million valuation allowance against a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that we acquired in an acquisition due to a change in control limitation which will prevent us from fully realizing these carryforwards 
the carryforwards expire from through the realization of these carryforwards depends on our ability to generate future taxable income in order to utilize these carryforwards 
the deferred tax asset related to the decline in the value of the stone shares is expected to be realized from future sales of these shares 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
successful efforts accounting 
we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and natural gas reserves  including certain general and administrative expenses 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  production history and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree imprecise  the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas prices may all differ materially from those assumed in these estimates 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we evaluate our properties on a field area basis for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
expected future cash flows are determined using estimated future prices based on market based forward prices applied to projected future production volumes 
the projected production volumes are based on the property s proved and risk adjusted probable oil and natural gas reserve estimates at the end of the period 
the oil and natural gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally 
table of contents differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows because the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the period 
asset retirement obligations 
we have obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of any surface equipment used in production operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
stock based compensation 
we follow the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r in accounting for equity based compensation 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the award vesting period 
we adopted sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method and accordingly the financial results for periods prior to january  have not been adjusted 
new accounting standards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb concurrently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations sfas r and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
both of these standards require measurements based on fair value and are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  in addition  both of these standards also include expanded disclosure requirements 
sfas r establishes accounting and reporting standards for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will impact the accounting and disclosures for any business combinations the company engages in after january  sfas amends accounting research bulletin to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
it requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
this statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
sfas clarifies that all such transactions are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
if there is a loss of control of the subsidiary  sfas requires the retained interest to be recorded at fair value 
the company currently does not expect adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard applies to derivative instruments  nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under sfas sfas does not change the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  but requires enhanced disclosures concerning the effect on the financial statements from their use 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim 
table of contents periods beginning after november  currently  we do not expect adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
under the provisions of this standard  unvested awards of share based payments with rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities for purposes of calculating earnings per share 
as a result  these participating securities will be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to determine basic earnings per share 
this fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
all prior period earnings per share data presented in financial reports after the effective date shall be adjusted retrospectively to conform with the provisions of this fsp 
early application is not permitted 
currently  we do not anticipate that adoption of the fsp will have a significant impact on our previously reported basic earnings per share amounts 
on october   the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies how companies should apply the fair value measurement methodologies of sfas to financial assets when markets they trade in are illiquid or inactive 
under the provisions of this fsp  companies may use their own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable inputs are either not available or are based solely on transaction prices that reflect forced liquidations or distressed sales 
this fsp was effective as of september  there was no impact to our financial position or results of operations from the adoption of this fsp 
related party transactions in recent years  we have not entered into any material transactions with our officers or directors apart from the compensation they are provided for their services 
we also have not entered into any business transactions with our significant stockholders or any other related parties  except for the purchase of  shares of bois d arc energy s common stock for million in august item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s oil and natural gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for crude oil  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on our oil and natural gas production in  a change in the price per barrel of oil would have resulted in a change in our cash flow for such period by approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would have changed our cash flow by approximately million 

table of contents we have hedged approximately of our price risks associated with our expected natural gas sales in as of december   our outstanding natural gas price swap agreements had a fair value of million 
the change in the fair value of our natural gas swaps that would result from a change in commodities prices at december  would be million 
such a change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease 
because our swap agreements have been designated as hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value generally are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the related sale of production occurs 
at that time  the realized hedge derivative gain or loss is transferred to oil and gas sales in our consolidated income statement 
none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date 
interest rates at december   we had long term debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt as of december  was million based on the market price of of the face amount 
at december   we had million outstanding under our bank credit facility  which was subject to variable rates of interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to libor or the corporate base rate  at our option 
any increase in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would change our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately million 
we had no interest rate derivatives outstanding during or at december
