in march  patterson medical completed the acquisition of the smith nephew rehabilitation snr division of smith nephew plc  and in doing so  acquired the rolyan  homecraft and kinetec brand names 
the snr acquisition added  additional products  as well as a broad array of other brand names and proprietary products

patterson medical manufactures or has exclusively manufactured for it products representing approximately of its total revenue and purchases products representing the remaining 
approximately of its revenue is in north america 
patterson medical believes the rehabilitation medical supplies and assistive products industry is approximately billion in the us and billion worldwide and is expected to grow faster than the overall economy over the next several years 
industry growth is driven by strong growth in the physical and occupational therapy markets and favorable demographic trends associated with the aging of the baby boom generation 
patterson medical does not compete in motorized wheelchairs or scooters  a market estimated to be a combined billion worldwide 
therefore  patterson medical s addressable market defined as the collective market for products sold by patterson medical is approximately billion worldwide 
patterson medical believes that it has an industry leading market share of approximately in a highly fragmented rehabilitation and assistive products market 

table of contents patterson medical believes that the demand for rehabilitation products will continue to be influenced by the following factors favorable demographics 
favorable demographic trends such as extended life expectancy  active lifestyles and a general willingness to spend discretionary income on health care and well being  are expected to contribute to increased demand for products distributed by patterson medical 
specifically  the aging baby boomer population  together with their increased disposable income and desire for independence  will fuel product purchases to assist with the frailties associated with old age and provide sustained sales growth 
the us census bureau has projected the year and older populations in the us to more than triple from four million in to million by the to year old population is expected to more than double during the same time period 
current trends indicate that these age groups represent the majority of home and community based health care patients 
the aging of the population is a revenue growth driver 
approximately of people over the age of and approximately of people over the age of need assistance with everyday activities 
patterson medical believes it is well positioned to benefit from this trend by providing aids to daily living  namely dressing devices  toileting  dining  bathing aids  and grooming devices  all of which promote greater patient independence  improved patient responsibility and improved responsiveness to treatment 
increasing number of pts and ots  patterson medical s primary user groups 
according to the us department of labor occupational outlook handbook  there were approximately  pts and  ots in the us in approximately two thirds of pts were employed in either hospitals or offices of physical therapists

the majority of ots work in hospitals  including many in rehabilitation and psychiatric hospitals 
the remaining ots work in outpatient occupational therapy offices and clinics  schools  home health agencies  nursing homes  community mental health centers  adult day care programs  job training services and residential care facilities 
the demand for pts and ots is expected to remain strong largely driven by the i increase in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited function requiring therapy services  ii rapidly growing elderly population which is particularly vulnerable to chronic and debilitating conditions that require therapeutic services  iii baby boom generation which is entering the prime age for heart attacks and strokes  increasing the demand for cardiac and physical rehabilitation  iv advances in medical technology which permit treatment of more disabling conditions  and v widespread interest in health promotion 
increasing frequency of reconstructive and implant surgery 
another important driver of the growth in the pt market is the growing need for rehabilitation products resulting from the increasing frequency of reconstructive implant procedures  including hip and knee replacements 
the worldwide reconstructive implant market is currently in excess of billion and expected to grow between and annually 
this growth trajectory is largely driven by favorable demographics  as patient populations are expanding at both ends of the age spectrum 
among seniors  more active lifestyles and longer life expectancies are responsible for the increasing frequency of reconstructive implants 
younger patients are opting for reconstructive implants over less invasive alternatives due to improved and longer lasting implant technology 
patterson medical believes it is well positioned to benefit from the growth in reconstructive implants  by providing orthopedic products  namely continuous passive motion machines and splinting  which are critical to post operatory rehabilitation

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s fiscal financial information is summarized in this management s discussion and analysis  the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes 
the following background is essential to more fully understand the company s financial information 
patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets dental supply  veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply 
historically the company s strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market 
in fiscal  the company expanded its strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of j 
a 
webster  inc on july  the company added a third component to its business platform in fiscal when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of abilityone products corp 
abilityone on september  abilityone is now known as patterson medical 
operating margins of the veterinary business are considerably lower than the dental and rehabilitation supply businesses 
while operating expenses run at a lower rate in the veterinary business  its gross margin is substantially lower 
over the past two years  the veterinary business has grown at a faster rate than the other two businesses  resulting in dilution of the consolidated operating margin 
there are several important aspects of the company s business that are useful in analyzing the company  including market growth in the various markets it operates  internal growth  growth through acquisition  and continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency 
management defines internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period  excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  and excluding the net sales  for a period of twelve months following the transaction date  of businesses that it has acquired 
during fiscal  the company executed a series of transactions that effectively changed our capital structure  lowering our weighted average cost of capital by almost basis points  and positioned the company to increase returns to our shareholders 
first  the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock on the open market and through an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately million 
a portion of the funding for the share repurchases came from debt issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of fixed rate private placement notes totaling million and a variable rate term loan of million 
results of operations the following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses operating income other income  net interest expense income before taxes income taxes net income 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
fiscal consolidated sales were  million  an increase of compared to  million in fiscal acquisitions contributed to sales growth  resulting primarily from an acquisition by the veterinary unit 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates reduced sales by 
during fiscal  sales at each of our business units were adversely affected by the economic recession 
the company believes the weakness in the general economy will continue to affect our performance in fiscal sales of our consolidated dental supply unit totaled  million  a decrease of from  million in fiscal acquisitions had a positive impact on sales of  while fluctuations in foreign currency rates related to our dental operations in canada reduced sales by 
sales of dental consumable supplies of  million were virtually unchanged from fiscal in the first half of fiscal  an economy related trend of patients deferring higher level and discretionary services began and continued throughout the year 
dental equipment sales declined in fiscal  including a decrease in basic equipment 
sales of cerec d dental restorative systems were lower in fiscal  but did grow in the second half of fiscal as compared to the second half of fiscal cerec system sales in the second half of the year benefitted from promotional financing arrangements that were made available to qualified customers  as well as the january introduction of a new digital image acquisition unit by the manufacturer  sirona dental systems  which provides significantly greater ease of use and imaging precision 
other dental sales  consisting primarily of technical service parts and labor  software support services and artificial teeth  grew in fiscal webster veterinary fiscal sales of million increased from million in fiscal acquisitions  primarily the columbus serum company columbus acquired in october  contributed of the sales growth 
during the second half of the year  veterinary clinics were negatively affected by the contracted economy 
sales declined at patterson medical  including a negative impact of related to foreign currency rates 
the impact of currency on sales growth was partially offset by a contribution of from acquisitions 
gross margin 
consolidated gross margin declined basis points to due to the veterinary unit s sales representing a larger percentage of consolidated sales in fiscal since veterinary gross margins are lower than the other two business units  the increase in veterinary s sales as a percentage of consolidated sales has a dilutive impact on the consolidated gross margin 
in addition  the gross margin of columbus is somewhat lower than the historical webster veterinary gross margin 
the dental segment s gross margin was unchanged from fiscal gross margin of the veterinary unit declined basis points in fiscal  due mostly to lower levels of vendor rebates earned and the lower columbus gross margins 
the negative impact of columbus on gross margin is expected to moderate as the business becomes fully integrated 
patterson medical s gross margin improved basis points  due mostly to better freight management and product pricing 
operating expenses 
the consolidated operating expense ratio in fiscal was  or basis points higher than fiscal beginning the third quarter of fiscal  the company began taking steps related to a range of cost control initiatives including a hiring freeze except in the area of sales representatives  a wage freeze and restrictions on travel 
operating expenses as a percent of sales at the dental unit increased basis points  reflecting lost leverage on lower than planned sales 
the veterinary unit s operating expense ratio improved basis points due 
table of contents primarily to the columbus business  which had a somewhat lower operating expense ratio as compared to that of the historical veterinary unit s operations 
patterson medical s operating expense ratio was basis points lower in fiscal in addition to the impact of expense control initiatives  the impact of added infrastructure expense at the branch locations added over the past three years has dissipated as the locations have become more established 
operating income 
operating income was million in fiscal  down million  or  from million in fiscal operating margin was and in fiscal years and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense was million compared to million in fiscal in march  the company issued million of long term debt which resulted in the higher level of interest expense in fiscal other income  net 
other income  net of other expenses  was million compared to million in fiscal interest income decreased million due primarily to a decline in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal net income and earnings per share 
net income declined to million due to a decrease in operating income and an increase in interest expense 
share repurchase activity in the second half of fiscal resulted in a decrease in shares outstanding in fiscal earnings per diluted share and dilutive shares outstanding were and million  respectively  in fiscal and and million  respectively  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
consolidated sales in fiscal totaled  million  an increase of compared to  million in fiscal foreign currency translation rates contributed one percentage point and acquisitions contributed to the sales growth in fiscal sales of our dental supply unit increased to  million 
sales of dental consumable supplies grew 
dental equipment sales grew  including basic equipment growth of 
sales of cerec d dental restorative systems rose 
other dental sales  consisting primarily of technical service parts and labor  software support services and artificial teeth  grew in fiscal webster veterinary sales grew to million from million 
in january  webster made a strategic decision to drop a line of products previously sold under an agency agreement  including flea tick and heartworm products  and replaced them with fully distributed product offerings from several vendor partners 
this transition progressed throughout the year as planned  although there was a modest negative impact to webster s operating metrics during the first half of fiscal sales growth of at patterson medical included the contribution of new branch offices that have been established by acquisition and greenfield expansion 
as a part of its initiative to expand and strengthen its value added model  the rehabilitation unit opened branch offices in selected markets throughout the united states during fiscal and fiscal the november acquisition of ptos software  a leading line of practice management software for physical therapists  enables patterson medical to create relationships with new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers 

table of contents gross margin 
consolidated gross margin of was basis points lower in fiscal due to declines at patterson medical and webster veterinary 
in addition  the sales growth of webster outpaced both the dental and rehabilitation segments  resulting in a dilutive impact to consolidated gross margin 
the dental segment s gross margin was flat  despite approximately million of expense related to a distribution agreement fee which began to be amortized in october in addition  local currency pricing in canada was lowered in the third quarter of fiscal in response to the strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the united states dollar 
gross margin decreased by basis points in fiscal at the veterinary unit 
this was largely a result of the decision to terminate an agency relationship late in the third quarter of fiscal  as replacement offerings for the products previously sold under the agency relationship are now being fully distributed 
patterson medical s gross margin declined basis points  due mostly to higher freight costs in the early part of fiscal in the second half of the year  better freight management and product pricing mitigated much of the higher freight costs 
operating expenses 
the consolidated operating expense ratio improved basis points to 
operating expenses as a percent of sales at the dental unit decreased basis points  reflecting the leverage of infrastructure investments over the past two years and the elimination of duplicate costs from the distribution system 
the operating expense ratio of the veterinary unit declined basis points due both to leverage on higher sales volume and distribution system realignment  including the closing of a stand alone warehouse 
patterson medical s operating expense ratio was basis points higher in fiscal  resulting from the infrastructure expense of adding branch locations through both acquisition and internal startups 
operating income 
operating income was million or of net sales in fiscal this amount represents an increase of from million in fiscal operating margin in fiscal was also interest expense 
interest expense was million compared to million in fiscal the average debt balance carried for the majority of fiscal was lower than in fiscal  resulting in the decrease in interest expense 
other income  net 
other income  net of other expenses  increased to million from million due to higher levels of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal  slightly higher than a rate of in the prior year 
net income and earnings per share 
net income increased to million 
earnings per diluted share of represents an increase of or from the earnings per share reported in fiscal approximately million shares of common stock were repurchased in the second half of fiscal liquidity and capital resources patterson s operating cash flow has been the company s principal source of liquidity in the last three fiscal years 
the issuance of million of debt in the march was used primarily to repurchase shares of the 
table of contents company s common stock 
during fiscal  the company used its revolving credit facility periodically as a source of liquidity in addition to operating cash flow 
operating activities generated cash of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal in the second half of fiscal  the company invested in a financing program to support marketing efforts directed at the cerec product line 
this promotion  which ended at the close of fiscal  generated approximately million of finance contracts that the company could not immediately sell to our funding sources due to certain requirements in those funding arrangements 
the company expects to fully liquidate these contracts in fiscal  resulting in an incremental million of cash flow in the year 
capital expenditures were  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fiscal and significant expenditures included the expansion of our general office building and the expansion of existing distribution facilities to accommodate multiple business units  in addition to continuing investments in information systems 
at april   one distribution facility expansion in florida remains in progress 
the company expects to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during fiscal  including the completion of the distribution center project in progress as of april  and investments in information systems 
cash used for acquisitions totaled million in fiscal the acquisitions of the columbus serum company and dolphin imaging systems  llc and dolphin practice management  llc accounted for the majority of the cash used 
payments on long term debt in fiscal were million and related to a scheduled retirement of debt that had been issued in fiscal as of april   million was outstanding under a revolving credit facility which expires in fiscal a maximum of million is available under this facility 
as noted above in march  the company closed on million of long term debt financing which was comprised of million of fixed rate private notes with maturities of five  seven and years in addition to a million five year term loan at a floating rate of interest through a group of banks 
the company used million of the debt financing to repurchase shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr 
the remaining proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes 
during the second half of fiscal  the company purchased shares of its common stock on the open market  under a million share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into an asr under which it paid million and took an initial delivery of million shares 
in total  the company repurchased approximately million shares for million during fiscal under the terms of the asr  the company could have received additional shares  or could have been required to pay the counterparty in the form of either cash or shares 
the final settlement of the asr occurred in june  with an additional million shares delivered to the company 
as of april   million shares can be repurchased under the current authorization by the board of directors  which expires on december  going forward  in the absence of desirable acquisition opportunities  the company would likely return excess cash to its shareholders through additional open market purchases of its common stock  or may consider initiating a dividend strategy 
management expects funds generated from operations and existing cash to be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs for the next fiscal year 
the company expects to continue to obtain liquidity from the sale of its equipment finance contracts  including the million of finance contracts generated during fiscal in addition  as of april   million is available under a revolving credit facility 
the 
table of contents company s existing debt facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives 
the company sells a significant portion of its installment sale contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank  and as a result  commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for the company 
the company is allowed to participate in the conduit due to the quality of its finance contracts and its financial strength 
cash flow could be impaired if the company s financial strength diminished to a level that precluded the company from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities 
also  market conditions outside of the company s control could adversely affect the ability of the company to sell the contracts 
customer financing arrangements the company is a party to two arrangements under which it sells finance contracts it receives from its customers to outside financial institutions 
these arrangements currently provide sources of liquidity for the company that would have to be replaced should the current financial institutions be unable or unwilling to continue in the arrangements 
the company s financing business is described in further detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
note  customer financing  discusses the nature and business purpose of the arrangements and the activity under each arrangement during fiscal  including the amount of finance contracts sold and residual interests held by the company 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of april  follows in thousands payment due by year contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted the provisions of fin at the beginning of fiscal the company is unable to determine its contractual obligations by year related to this pronouncement  as the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of its reserves for income taxes cannot be reasonably estimated 
the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as of april   is million 
in addition  the company is contractually committed to approximately million of capital expenditures relating to a distribution facility construction project that is in process as of april  for a more complete description of our contractual obligations  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
outlook over the last years  the company has been able to grow revenue and earnings through its strategy of emphasizing its value added  full service capabilities  using technology to enhance customer service  continuing to improve operating efficiencies  and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions 
while we believe that the weakness in the general economy that existed throughout much of fiscal will continue to affect our performance for at least several more quarters  the company s strategy will continue to focus on these key elements 
with strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity  the company is confident that it will be able to financially support its future growth 
the strategic initiatives that the company has implemented in the 
table of contents past several years  as well as those that will be implemented in fiscal and beyond  will strengthen the company s operational platform and contribute to future growth 
given these factors  the company considers itself well positioned to capitalize upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply  companion pet veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilitation supply markets 
asset management the following table summarizes the company s days sales outstanding dso and inventory turnover the past three fiscal years days sales outstanding inventory turnover receivables as of april  include approximately million of finance contracts received from customers related to a financing promotion 
the company expects to sell these contracts to outside institutions under existing agreements during fiscal if these finance contracts are excluded from the calculation of dso  the pro forma dso would be the inventory values used in this calculation are the lifo inventory values for all inventories except for manufactured inventories and foreign inventories  which are valued using fifo inventory methods 
foreign operations foreign sales are derived primarily from patterson dental and patterson medical operations in canada and from patterson medical s operations in the uk and france 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings 
however  changes in exchange rates adversely affected net sales in fiscal and enhanced net sales in fiscal and without foreign currency effects  net sales would have been million higher  million lower and million lower in fiscal years  and  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates are a risk accompanying foreign operations  but this risk is not considered material with respect to the consolidated operations of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has adopted various accounting policies to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management believes that the company s policies are conservative and its philosophy is to adopt accounting policies that minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time 
changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic  technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of the company s assets and liabilities 
therefore  the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the consolidated financial statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future 
this may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply the company s significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial performance and condition of the company may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that the company has not previously experienced and for which the company has not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition processes involve establishing estimates for returns  damaged goods  rebates and other revenue allowances 
these estimates are based on historical experience and the 
table of contents facts known at the date of the preparation of the financial statements  but future events could cause actual results to vary from our estimates 
inventory and reserves inventory consists primarily of merchandise held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for all inventories  except for foreign inventories and manufactured inventories  which are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company continually assesses the valuation of our inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to estimated realizable value 
estimates are made of the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other indefinite lived intangible assets include copyrights  trade names and trademarks 
the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill for each reporting unit be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the company has three reporting segments at april   which are the same as our operating units 
the company tests goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
fair value is determined using valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the company conducts impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management completed its annual goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests and determined there was no impairment 
although the company believes our estimates and assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such estimates and assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results  including an impairment charge that could be material 
long lived assets long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 
the company s definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of an exclusive distribution agreement and customer lists 
when impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are supportable  the company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
the company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made and could materially affect our financial results 

table of contents to the extent that the provision for income taxes would have increased decreased by percent of income before taxes  consolidated net income would have decreased increased million in fiscal share based compensation the company accounts for share based payment awards in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the company recognizes share based compensation based on certain assumptions including inputs within the black scholes model and estimated forfeitures 
these assumptions require subjective judgment and changes in the assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates 
management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate forfeitures and to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation on a regular basis 
circumstances may change  and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination or estimates of forfeitures 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r  the amount of compensation expense associated with sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the disclosures required for assets and liabilities measured at fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in canadian dollars  british pounds and euros 
although historically the company has elected not to enter into any hedging contracts  it continually evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to the company s most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately million on fiscal net sales 
this amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses 
the company s earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of its cash balances  borrowings under libor based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates 
as of april   the company had a million variable rate term note outstanding and million drawn on a variable rate revolving credit facility 
the company views its variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to the company s cash and short term investments balances 
when considering the exposure under the agreements whereby the company sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks  the company has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from day libor up to twelve month libor 
in addition  the portfolio of installment contracts generally turns over in less than months and the company can adjust the rate it charges on new customer contracts at any time 
therefore  in times where the interest rate markets are not rapidly increasing or decreasing  the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements 
in calculating the gain on the contract sales  the company uses an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts 
if increases in the interest rate markets occur  the average interest rate in our contract portfolio may not increase at the same rate  resulting in a reduction of gain on the contracts sales as compared to the gain that would be realized if the average interest rate in our portfolio were to increase at a more similar rate to the interest rate markets 
the company estimates that if interest rates had been higher during the year  the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by approximately million
