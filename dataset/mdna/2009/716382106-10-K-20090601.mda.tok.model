on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue by selling pet medication and health products  and pet supplies primarily to retail consumers and minimally to wholesale customers 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment  when the rights of ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
outbound shipping and handling fees are included in sales and are billed upon shipment 
shipping expenses are included in cost of sales 
the majority of the company s sales are paid by credit cards and the company usually receives the cash settlement in two to three banking days 
credit card sales minimize accounts receivable balances relative to sales 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that the company estimates will arise from customers inability to make required payments  arising from either credit card charge backs or insufficient funds checks

 accounting for income taxes  which generally requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax benefits or consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse

as of march  the company had approximately  remaining under the company s share repurchase plan 
based on future market conditions the company may utilize its cash and cash equivalents on the remaining balance of its current share repurchase plan 
the company had  par invested in auction rate securities ars which were classified as long term investments in our financial statements as of march  our ars investments are not mortgage backed based but are municipal based and the securities underlying the ars are currently rated aaa  the highest rating available by a rating agency 
our ars consist of closed end fund preferred ars  whose interest rates are reset  typically every seven to twenty eight days 
the fair value of investments was determined based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those instruments in fiscal  and in fiscal the fair value was based upon a valuation assessment by an outside third party 
as of march   the company held  par in ars  which were classified as long term investments and the company recorded an unrealized impairment loss of  i n the fourth quarter of fiscal  within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  based upon an assessment of the fair value of these ars 
the  impairment was recorded as temporary due to the fact that the company has both the ability and intent to hold these securities until anticipated recovery or maturity 
however  it could take until the final maturity or issuer refinancing of the underlying debt for us to realize the recorded value of our investments in these securities 
if the issuers of our ars are unable to successfully close future auctions or redeem or refinance the securities and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an additional impairment charge on these investments  or may need to sell these securities on a secondary market 
although we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments in these securities without any significant loss  the timing and financial impact of such an outcome is uncertain 
based o n our expected cash expenditures  our cash and cash equivalents balance  and other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity of these investments in the near term will adversely affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of march  and the company had no outstanding lease commitments except for the lease for its  square foot executive offices  warehouse facility  and customer service and pharmacy contact centers 
we are not currently bound by any long or short term agreements for the purchase or lease of capital expenditures 
any amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately provide for any increase in our business

presently  we have approximately  forecasted for capital expenditures to further support and maintain the company s growth during fiscal  which will be funded through cash from operations

fsp fas and fas amends the other than temporary impairment guidance in us gaap for debt securities  changes existing guidance for determining whether an impairment is other than temporary to debt securities  replaces the existing requirement that the entity s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery  requires that an entity recognize noncredit losses on held to maturity debt securities in other comprehensive income and amortize that amount over the remaining life of the security in a prospective manner  requires an entity to present the total other than temporary impairment in the statement of income with an offset for the amount recognized in other comprehensive income  and when adopting fsp fas and fas  an entity is required to record a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption

the company does not believe that any other recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting standards  if currently adopted  will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the book values of cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of march   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  and  in long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by our board of directors 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality  and maturity  and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with both short and long term maturities 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
at march   we had no debt obligations
