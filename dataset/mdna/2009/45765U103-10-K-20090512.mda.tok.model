item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations  which gives effect to the restatement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in risk factors in part i  item a and elsewhere in this report 
restatement of consolidated financial statements background on february   following an internal review we issued a press release announcing that our management had identified errors in the company s accounting for trade credits in prior periods dating back to december the internal review encompassed aged trade credits  including both aged accounts receivable credits and aged accounts payable credits  arising in the ordinary course of business that were recognized in the company s statements of operations prior to the legal discharge of the underlying liabilities under applicable domestic and foreign laws 
in a form k filed on february   we reported that the company s financial statements  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and related audit reports thereon in our most recently filed annual report on form k  for the year ended december   and the interim financial statements in our quarterly reports on form q for the first three quarters of  and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by the company relating to such financial statements  should no longer be relied upon 
we informed the administrative agents and lenders under our senior revolving credit facility  our accounts receivable securitization financing facility and our inventory financing facility of our intention to restate our financial statements 
the errors and restatement constituted a default under each of these facilities 
accordingly  we sought and received the waivers required to resolve this default 
following management s identification of errors in the company s accounting for aged trade credits  the company retained outside legal counsel to conduct a factual investigation into the company s accounting practices pertaining to aged trade credits 
the board of directors and its audit committee separately retained counsel to oversee and participate in the investigation  reach findings  and propose remedial measures to the audit committee 
company counsel and board counsel jointly retained forensic accountants to assist in the investigation and to gather documents and information from company personnel 
as part of this investigation and review process  outside counsel and forensic accountants gathered and evaluated documents and interviewed current and former company employees 
the audit committee was advised of the progress of the investigation and the internal review on a regular basis 
outside counsel has informed the audit committee that the internal investigation is complete 
board counsel has presented its findings to the audit committee 
interviews  document reviews and forensic analysis conducted during the internal investigation did not indicate an intent to manipulate the company s accounting or financial results 
the audit committee has received these findings as well as the recommendations of management  board counsel and other advisors concerning the proposed remedial actions to be taken with respect to the aged trade credit issue 
the audit committee has adopted these remedial measures and directed management to implement them under the supervision of the audit committee 
detailed information about the remedial measures that management plans to implement is included in part ii  item a controls and procedures of this report 
we determined  based upon the results of our internal review and analysis and the related internal investigation  that the periods in which certain aged trade credits in accounts receivable and accounts payable were previously recorded as a reduction of costs of goods sold preceded the periods in which the company was legally discharged of the underlying liabilities under applicable domestic and foreign laws 
the restated consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k reflect the corrections resulting from our determination 
the cumulative restatement charge covering the period from december  through september  related to this trade credit issue is million  or million after taxes 
these aged trade credit liabilities totaled million as of december  we expect that the final settlement of these liabilities with our clients and our partners and ultimately with state and or foreign regulatory bodies may take multiple years and may be settled for less than the estimated liability 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that the final settlement will be materially lower
