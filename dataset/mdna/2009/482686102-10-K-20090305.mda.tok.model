overview the company designs  develops and markets an array of athletic footwear for high performance sports use  fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand  and also designs and manufactures footwear under the royal elastics and the palladium brands 
royal elastics is our wholly owned subsidiary 
we own a equity interest in palladium 
the categories of footwear we sell are explained in more detail in part i  item  under the subheading  products 
we market our products in the united states through company employed sales managers and independent regional sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores 
we also sell our products through our website and internationally through company employed sales managers  independent sales representatives and a number of foreign distributors 
the retail environment was particularly challenging during the last few quarters of and is forecasted for the near term to remain depressed  given the recent deterioration in the overall economy and financial markets  which could put additional pressure on the company s ability to maintain margins 
in  approximately of our footwear products were manufactured in china 
we have no long term manufacturing agreements  but we believe that our relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of products 
our total revenues decreased in from  due to a decrease in the volume of footwear sold and a decrease in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross profit margin is mainly due to product mix  recognition of inventory reserves and recognition of an underpayment of certain business taxes in a foreign jurisdiction 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in from of revenues in however  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in from due a decrease in advertising expenses offset by increases in compensation expenses and data processing expenses incurred as a result of our sap implementation in certain operational regions 
in  our largest single marketing expenditure was television 
our marketing campaign was run mainly on network and cable television  and was supported by sports  music and general interest fashion magazines 
our domestic independent sales representatives sold to approximately 
table of contents separate accounts as of december  up from  as of december  
internationally  at the end of  we had the exclusive right to market our products in countries through international subsidiaries and distributors 
other income for consisted of a settlement payment of  in connection with a lawsuit protecting our trademarks  which is included in other income 
at december   our total futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were  a decrease of from the comparable period of the prior year 
of this amount  domestic futures orders were  a decrease of  and international futures orders were  a decrease of 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we recognize that the athletic footwear industry is highly competitive 
several makers of footwear with whom we compete have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources as well as greater brand awareness than us 
net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for decreased and  respectively  to  or per diluted share  compared with  or per diluted share  in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for includes the  settlement payment described above 
in  we had a net cash inflow of approximately  from operating activities  a net cash outflow of  from investing activities due to the net purchase of property  plant and equipment  the purchase of intangible assets and the purchase of palladium sas palladium and a net cash outflow of  from financing activities mainly as a result of a distribution on december  of a special cash dividend of per share to stockholders of record on december  we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to borrowings under our lines of credit and  depending on future operating results  additional funds may be required for operating activities 
on july   we purchased a equity interest in palladium for million  or approximately million  including a loan of million  or approximately million 
at december   we had debt outstanding of  attributable to palladium and there was no debt outstanding at december   excluding outstanding letters of credit of  and  at december  and  respectively 
our working capital decreased  to approximately  at december  from  at december   mainly as a result of the special cash dividend discussed above 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the 
table of contents basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see results of operations compared to other income  interest and taxes  for discussion regarding the estimate and settlement of an underpayment of payroll withholdings in a foreign jurisdiction from january  through december  we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer according to the terms of the order 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and allowances as reductions to revenues 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances and specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers and historical level of credit losses  as well as an assessment of the overall retail conditions 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the market value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional charge to cost of sales 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been 
table of contents recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions and recognize the benefit exposure of those positions if they meet the more likely than not threshold 
any tax position recognized is an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
also  at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with tax authorities may affect tax positions taken 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix or level of earnings 
we have not recorded united states income tax expense on earnings of selected foreign subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as permanently invested is based upon our expectations of the future cash needs of our subsidiaries 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of earnings to be permanently invested 
because the declaration involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as permanently invested may ultimately be repatriated 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer permanently invested 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full calendar year by estimating pre tax income  excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  and tax expense for the remaining quarterly periods of the year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to year to date pre tax income to determine the estimated year to date and quarterly tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the quarterly period in which they occur 
as the year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date income tax provision equals the estimated annual rate 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
palladium purchase on may   the company entered into a share purchase and shareholders rights agreement the agreement by and among christophe mortemousque  palladium and the company providing for the purchase of equity interest in palladium from its shareholders for a total purchase price of million  or approximately million including a loan of million  or approximately million

in an effort to increase customer acceptance of our products  during late early  we hired several individuals in product design and management  however  it will take additional time for the full impact of the contribution of these individuals to affect our business 
in addition  the current downturn of the worldwide economy has had and will continue to have an adverse affect on our business 
k swiss brand revenues decreased to  in from  in this decrease was the result of a decrease in the volume of footwear sold and a decrease in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
the volume of footwear sold decreased to  pair in from  pair in the average wholesale price per pair was in and in  a decrease of  which resulted from product mix changes offset by international sales becoming a larger portion of revenues 
royal elastics brand revenues decreased to  in of which were derived from domestic sales from  in of which were derived from domestic sales 
palladium brand revenues were  in all of this revenue was derived from sales outside the us  representing six months of revenue 
we believe the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end 
table of contents holiday seasons 
we present full line offerings for the easter season for delivery during the first and second quarters and back to school season for delivery during the third quarter  but only limited offerings for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  lower and lower  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year

a detailed analysis performed by our tax advisors and accountants during the third quarter of determined that the total amount of business taxes underpaid and related interest was approximately  we will finalize the amount owed with the appropriate taxing authority within the next three to six months 
penalties are discretionary  ranging from zero to of taxes owed and  at this time  we cannot determine the likelihood of such assessment and have not recognized penalties related to this 
however  there can be no guarantee that penalties will not be imposed 
our gross margins may not be comparable to some of our competitors as we recognize warehousing costs within selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  was the result of a decrease in advertising expenses  gains on ineffective hedges and a decrease in salesman sample expenses  offset by increases in compensation expenses and data processing expenses 
advertising expenses decreased for the year ended december  primarily due to decreases in both domestic and international markets as part of an effort to reduce costs as our business declines 
gains on ineffective hedges contributed to a  decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
salesman sample expenses decreased as a result of cost reductions and also as a result of our declining revenues 
data processing expenses increased for the year ended december  as a result of on going maintenance expenses incurred in connection with the company s fourth quarter of sap implementation to our domestic and certain international operational regions and expenses related to the company s continuing sap computer software implementation to other international operational regions in the increase in compensation expenses of for the year ended december  was due to stock option expenses recognized as a result of the repricing of stock options  see note j to our consolidated financial statements  an increase in headcount  a decrease in the reversal of bonus incentive related expenses that were calculated in accordance with the bonus formula under our economic value added eva incentive program and severance payments made  offset by decreases in other bonus incentive related expenses

the september settlement reached with this foreign jurisdiction resulted in us paying of the payroll withholding liability plus a penalty for periods starting from may through august  however interest was not assessed 
therefore  the amount settled was lower than the amounts previously estimated 
overall net interest income was  of revenues in compared to  of revenues in  a decrease of  or

on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
creates a single model to address the accounting for the uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before recognition in the financial statements 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin no 
is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit expense to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit expense that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
any tax position recognized would be an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
fin no 
allows the company to prospectively change its accounting policy as to where interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities are classified 
effective january   we changed our accounting policy and began to classify interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings 
prior to january   interest expense and penalties were recognized as a reduction to net interest income and an increase to selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  on our consolidated statement of earnings 
we recognize our uncertain tax positions in either accrued income taxes  if determined to be short term  or other liabilities if determined to be long term  on our consolidated balance sheet

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro  us dollar and the pound sterling and between the euro and the pound sterling 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose us to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
our primary risk exposures are from changes in the rates 
table of contents between the us dollar and the euro  us dollar and the pound sterling and between the euro and the pound sterling 
in and  we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars  pound sterling for us dollars and pound sterling for euros 
the extent to which forward foreign exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts are generally expected to settle in less than one year 
the forward foreign exchange contracts generally require us to exchange euros for us dollars  pound sterling for us dollars or pound sterling for euros at maturity  at rates agreed upon at the inception of the contracts 
our counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions with an investment grade or better credit rating  however  we are exposed to credit risk with these institutions 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should these counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
at december   forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of  were outstanding to exchange various currencies with maturities ranging from january to september  to sell the equivalent of approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates and to buy approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates

cash flows from these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations or financial position relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term borrowings on our working capital lines of credit 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company
