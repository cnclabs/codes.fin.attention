item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing proprietary products that address the needs of patients treated by gastroenterologists and other targeted physicians 
our commercial organization is currently promoting zegerid omeprazole sodium bicarbonate capsules and powder for oral suspension  which are proprietary formulations that combine omeprazole  which is a proton pump inhibitor  or ppi  and an antacid 
we developed these products as the first immediate release oral ppis for the us prescription market  and they have been approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to treat or reduce the risk of a variety of upper gastrointestinal  or gi  diseases and disorders  including gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd 
our zegerid products are based on patented technology and utilize antacids  which raise the gastric ph and thus protect the ppi  omeprazole  from acid degradation in the stomach  allowing the omeprazole to be quickly absorbed into the bloodstream 
we commercially launched zegerid capsules in early and zegerid powder for oral suspension in late and early our commercial organization also promotes glumetza metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets prescription products in the us  under the terms of an exclusive promotion agreement that we entered into with depomed  inc  or depomed  in july glumetza is a once daily  extended release formulation of metformin that incorporates patented drug delivery technology and is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type diabetes 
the extended release delivery system is designed to offer patients with diabetes an ability to reach their optimal dose of metformin with fewer gi side effects 
we began our promotion of the glumetza products in october we are developing two product candidates targeting lower gi conditions under the terms of a strategic collaboration that we entered into with cosmo technologies limited  or cosmo  in december the product candidates utilize cosmo s patented mmx technology  which is a proprietary multi matrix system that is designed to result in the controlled release and homogeneous distribution of a drug substance throughout the length of the colon 
the goal of the mmx technology is to improve efficacy while reducing side effects by minimizing systemic absorption 
budesonide mmx is an oral corticosteroid and is currently being investigated in two phase iii clinical trials for the induction of remission of mild or moderate active ulcerative colitis 
rifamycin sv mmx is a broad spectrum  semi synthetic antibiotic and has been investigated in a phase ii clinical program for traveler s diarrhea 
under the strategic collaboration  we were granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize these product candidates in the us 
table of contents in addition  in january  we submitted a new drug application  or nda  to the fda for a new tablet formulation to add to our zegerid family of prescription products 
the new formulation is an immediate release tablet that combines omeprazole with a mix of buffers 
to further leverage our proprietary ppi technology and diversify our sources of revenue  we licensed exclusive rights to schering plough consumer healthcare products  inc  or schering plough  under our patented ppi technology to develop  manufacture and sell zegerid brand over the counter  or otc  products in the lower dosage strength of mg of omeprazole in the us and canada 
we have also entered into a license agreement and a distribution agreement granting exclusive rights to glaxo group limited  an affiliate of glaxosmithkline  plc  or gsk  under our patented ppi technology to develop  manufacture and commercialize prescription and otc products in up to specified countries outside of the us  europe  australia  japan and canada including markets within africa  asia  the middle east  and central and south america  and to distribute and sell zegerid brand prescription products in puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we follow staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales  net 
we sell our zegerid products primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of products that are within six months of their expiration date or up to months beyond their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established allowances for such amounts at the time of sale 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sab no 
and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
among its criteria for revenue recognition from sale transactions where a buyer has a right of return  sfas no 
requires the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimable 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  estimated rebates in connection with contracts relating to managed care  medicaid  medicare  and patient coupons  and estimated chargebacks from distributors  wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
we establish allowances for estimated product returns  rebates and chargebacks based primarily on the following qualitative and quantitative factors the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated remaining shelf life of products  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  direct communication with customers  historical product returns  rebates and chargebacks  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  and the impact of state and federal regulations 

table of contents in our analyses  we utilize prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize a separate analysis which compares historical product shipments less returns to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the distribution channel which may be subject to various product return  rebate and chargeback exposures 
our estimates of product returns  rebates and chargebacks require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual future payments for returns  rebates  chargebacks and other discounts exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
our allowance for product returns was million as of december  and million as of december  in order to provide a basis for estimating future product returns on sales to our customers at the time title transfers  we have been tracking our zegerid products return history from the time of our first commercial product launch of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in late  taking into consideration product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel 
we recognize product sales at the time title passes to our customers  and we provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time based upon our historical product returns trends  our analysis of product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel  and the other factors discussed above 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we receive the product return and issue credit to a customer 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
in  based upon our review of additional product returns history gathered through the end of and analysis of product expiration dating and inventory in the distribution channel  we increased our estimate for product returns to reflect actual experience accordingly 
this change in estimate provided for potential product returns related to sales in prior periods and resulted in an increase to our net loss of approximately million in our allowance for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts was million as of december  and million as of december  these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts  rebates due to various governmental organizations under medicaid and medicare contracts and regulations  chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements  and other rebates and customer discounts due in connection with wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a combination of the qualitative and quantitative assumptions listed above 
in each reporting period  we evaluate our outstanding contracts and apply the contractual discounts to the invoiced price of wholesaler shipments recognized 
although the total invoiced price of shipments to wholesalers for the reporting period and the contractual terms are known during the reporting period  we project the ultimate disposition of the sale eg future utilization rates of cash payors  managed care  medicaid  medicare or other contracted organizations 
this estimate is based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes based on specific contractual terms of new agreements with customers  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors and the other qualitative and quantitative factors described above 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we make the contractual payment or issue credit to a customer 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
to date  actual results have not materially differed from our estimates 
promotion revenue and license and royalty revenue 
we recognize promotion revenue and license and royalty revenue consistent with the provisions of sab no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 
table of contents revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we analyze each element of our promotion and licensing agreements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on upfront payments over the period of significant involvement under the related agreements unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services rendered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and no further performance obligation exists under the contract 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are nonrefundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recognized as deferred revenue 
sales milestones  royalties and promotion fees are recognized as revenue when earned under the agreements 
inventories and related reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost fifo or market and consist of finished goods and raw materials used in the manufacture of our zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension products 
also included in inventories are product samples of the glumetza products which we purchase from depomed under our promotion agreement 
inventories as of december  also included product samples of naprelan naproxen sodium controlled release tablets which we purchased from victory pharma  inc  or victory  under our co promotion agreement  which was terminated effective as of october  we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized for  and included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is generally shorter than the expected life of the option  we consider the expected volatility of similar entities as well as our historical volatility since our initial public offering in april in determining our volatility factor 
in evaluating similar entities  we consider factors such as industry  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
in determining the expected life of the options  we use the short cut method described in sab no 
under this method  the expected life is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
we will continue to use the short cut method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to estimate the expected life of the options 
for options granted prior to january   we amortized the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period ranging from one to four years 
pre vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately for  and as the majority of options granted contain monthly vesting terms 
in  certain stock options were granted to employees at or above the vice president level that vest upon the attainment of specific financial performance targets 
the measurement date of stock options containing performance based vesting is the date the stock option grant is authorized and the specific performance goals are communicated 
compensation expense is recognized based on the probability that the performance criteria will be met 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based vesting requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
the continued assessment of probability may result in additional expense recognition or expense reversal depending on the level of achievement of the performance goals 

table of contents we account for options issued to non employees under sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity investments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
as such  the value of options issued to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
the following table includes stock based compensation recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
in our statement of operations in thousands years ended december  cost of product sales research and development selling  general and administrative total in  we accelerated the vesting of certain out of the money stock options with per share exercise prices of or greater for employees below the vice president level 
we recognized million in stock based compensation expense associated with the stock option vesting acceleration on november  as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately million  and the weighted average period over which it was expected to be recognized was years 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales  net 
product sales  net were million for  million for and million for and consisted of sales of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
the million increase in product sales  net from to was primarily attributable to an increase in the sales volume of zegerid capsules as well as increased average selling prices 
the million increase in product sales  net from to was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of zegerid capsules  which we commercially launched in early for as compared to and as compared to  the amount of rebates  chargebacks and other discounts has grown primarily as a result of increased sales of our zegerid products and increased utilization under contracts with various managed care organizations and governmental organizations relating to medicaid and medicare 
additionally  based upon our review of additional product returns history gathered through the end of and analysis of product expiration dating and estimated inventory in the distribution channel  we increased our estimate for product returns in to reflect actual experience accordingly 
this change in estimate provided for potential product returns related to sales in prior periods and resulted in an increase to our net loss of approximately million in promotion revenue 
promotion revenue was million for and million for there was no promotion revenue in in and  promotion revenue was comprised of co promotion fees earned under our agreements with victory pursuant to which we co promoted the naprelan products and with cb fleet company  incorporated  or fleet  pursuant to which we co promoted the fleet phospho soda ez prep bowel cleansing system 
in july  we and victory mutually agreed to terminate our co promotion agreement previously entered into in june we ended all promotional efforts under the agreement as of september  we entered into our co promotion agreement with fleet in august  which was subsequently amended in may effective as of october   our co promotion agreement expired in accordance with its terms 
we received co promotion fees of approximately million over the term of the co promotion agreement with fleet 
promotion revenue for also included fees earned under our promotion agreement with depomed of approximately million for the three months ended december  
table of contents license and royalty revenue 
license and royalty revenue was million for  million for  and million for significant components of our license and royalty revenue are described below in june  we received a million nonrefundable regulatory milestone relating to fda acceptance for filing of an nda submitted by schering plough for a zegerid branded omeprazole sodium bicarbonate otc product in a mg dosage strength of omeprazole 
in august  we received a nonrefundable million milestone payment from schering plough relating to progress on clinical development strategy 
we recognized the payments of million and million in license and royalty revenue in and  respectively  due to the substantive nature of the milestones achieved 
in november  we received a nonrefundable million upfront license fee in connection with our license agreement with schering plough 
the million upfront payment is being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over a month period through the end of  which represents the estimated period during which we have significant responsibilities under the agreement 
in december  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our license and distribution agreements with gsk 
to support gsk s initial launch costs  we agreed to waive the first million of aggregate royalties payable under the agreements 
of the total million upfront payment  the million in waived royalty obligations was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue as the royalties are earned 
the remaining million was also recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over an month period  which represents the estimated period we are obligated to supply zegerid products to gsk for sale in puerto rico and the us virgin islands under the distribution agreement 
in october  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our non exclusive agreement with otsuka america pharmaceutical inc  or otsuka america  under which otsuka america had been co promoting zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
the million upfront payment was being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the month contractual term through the end of on may   we agreed to terminate the co promotion agreement effective as of june  in connection with the termination  we amortized the remaining balance of the million up front payment previously received from otsuka america in october and recognized approximately million in license and royalty revenue in associated with this amortization 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was million for  million for and million for  or approximately  and of net product sales  respectively 
cost of product sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  freight and indirect personnel and other overhead costs associated with the sales of our zegerid products 
cost of product sales also includes reserves for excess  dated or obsolete commercial inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
the decrease in our cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales from to was primarily attributable to increased average selling prices 
additionally  the decrease in our cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales from to and from to was attributable to lower manufacturing costs associated with our capsule product and certain fixed costs being applied to increased sales volumes 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties were million for  million for and million for license fees and royalties consisted of royalties due to the university of missouri and otsuka america based upon our net product sales as well as royalties due to the university of missouri based upon products sold by gsk under our license and distribution agreements

in addition  in  license fees and royalties included license fee amortization from the million upfront fee paid to depomed under our promotion agreement entered into in july the million upfront fee has been capitalized and is being amortized to license fee expense over the estimated useful life of the asset on a straight line basis through mid 
table of contents in december  we entered into a strategic collaboration with cosmo including a license agreement  stock issuance agreement and registration rights agreement  under which we were granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the budesonide mmx and rifamycin sv mmx product candidates in the us as upfront consideration  we issued  shares of our common stock and made a cash payment of million to cosmo 
we may also pay cosmo up to a total of million in clinical and regulatory milestones for the initial indications for the licensed products  up to million in clinical and regulatory milestones for a second indication for rifamycin sv mmx and up to million in commercial milestones 
the milestones may be paid in cash or through issuance of additional shares of our common stock  at cosmo s option  subject to certain limitations 
we will pay tiered royalties to cosmo ranging from to on net sales of any licensed products we sell 
the royalties are subject to reduction in certain circumstances  including in the event of market launch in the us of a generic version of a licensed product 
the cash payment of million and the fair value of the  shares of our common stock issued to cosmo of approximately million were included in license fees and royalties in under the stock issuance agreement  cosmo has agreed that for the months following the date of issuance of the initial  shares of common stock and for the six months following the issuance of any shares of common stock upon achievement of milestones  it will not transfer or dispose of any such issued shares 
in addition  cosmo has agreed through december  that neither it nor its affiliates will acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of our common stock  other than under the stock issuance agreement  subject to certain exceptions 
our obligation to issue additional shares of common stock to cosmo upon the achievement of one or more milestones is subject to certain limitations  including that the total number of shares of common stock issued to cosmo  including the initial  shares  shall not exceed  shares 
any such additional shares to be issued will be valued at the average daily closing price of the common stock as reported on the nasdaq global market for the consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately prior to the achievement of the applicable milestone 
we estimated a fair value of per share for the initial  shares of our common stock issued to cosmo in  which reflected a discount of approximately on the per share closing price of our common stock on the issuance date 
for a publicly traded stock  the fair value of a single unrestricted share of common stock is assumed to be equivalent to the quoted market price on the valuation date 
however  since the  shares issued to cosmo have a month trading restriction pursuant to the stock issuance agreement  we calculated a discount for lack of marketability  or dlom  applicable to the quoted market price 
we calculated the dlom associated with the contractual restriction using the black scholes valuation model for a hypothetical put option with the following assumptions life of the option of years  risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and dividend rate of 
under the terms of the registration rights agreement  we filed a resale registration statement on form s with the sec in january  to register the resale of shares issuable to cosmo under the stock issuance agreement 
we are obligated to use best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  million for and million for the million increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to our strategic collaboration with cosmo entered into in december we will be responsible for one half of the total out of pocket costs associated with the two ongoing multi center budesonide mmx phase iii clinical trials and for all of the out of pocket costs for the planned rifamycin sv mmx phase iii us registration trial 
included in our research and development expenses for was approximately million representing one half of the out of pocket costs incurred in connection with the ongoing budesonide mmx phase iii clinical trials which are reimbursable to cosmo through december  in addition to the costs associated with our strategic collaboration with cosmo  the increase in our research and development expenses from to was attributable to development costs associated with a new tablet formulation we intend to add to our zegerid family of branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
in january  we submitted a b nda to the fda for this new tablet formulation 
this increase in research and development expenses was offset in part by a decrease in spending associated with zegerid capsules 
included in was spending associated with our clinical 
table of contents trial evaluating the effects of morning dosing of each of zegerid capsules and delayed release ppi brands  protonix and prevacid  on hour gastric acid control in patients with symptoms of gerd 
there were no expenses associated with this clinical trial in the  decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in manufacturing development activities associated with the capsule and chewable tablet products and a decrease in stock based compensation  offset in part by spending associated with our clinical trial evaluating the effects of morning dosing of each of zegerid capsules and delayed release ppi brands  protonix and prevacid  on hour gastric acid control in patients with symptoms of gerd 
research and development expenses have historically consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our products under development as well as clinical studies designed to further differentiate our zegerid products from those of our competitors  development of and preparation for commercial manufacturing of our products  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses 
in connection with our strategic collaboration with cosmo entered into in december  we are developing two product candidates targeting lower gi conditions 
budesonide mmx is an oral corticosteroid and is currently being investigated in two multi center phase iii clinical trials for the induction of remission of mild or moderate active ulcerative colitis 
assuming successful and timely completion of the clinical program  we plan to submit an nda for budesonide mmx to the fda in rifamycin sv mmx is a broad spectrum  semi synthetic antibiotic and has been investigated in a phase ii clinical program for traveler s diarrhea 
assuming successful and timely completion of certain non clinical and pharmacokinetic clinical activities  we would then expect to file an investigational new drug application with the fda and initiate the planned phase iii us registration trial in traveler s diarrhea in the first half of we are unable to estimate with any certainty the research and development costs that we may incur in the future 
we have also committed  in connection with the approval of our ndas for zegerid powder for oral suspension  to evaluate the product in pediatric populations  including pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic  or pk pd  and safety studies 
in the future  we may conduct additional clinical trials to further differentiate our zegerid family of products  as well as conduct research and development related to any future products that we may in license or otherwise acquire 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing our zegerid family of products and development of the budesonide mmx and rifamycin sv mmx product candidates  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific  clinical and commercial merits of each project 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  million for and million for the million decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in costs associated with our advertising and promotional activities related to our zegerid products  a decrease in the number of sales representatives under our contract sales organization agreement with inventiv and a decrease in stock based compensation 
these decreases in expenses were offset in part by an increase in legal fees primarily due to the patent infringement litigation against par pharmaceutical  inc  or par  and costs associated with sales training and advertising and promotional activities associated with the commencement of promotion of the glumetza products under our promotion agreement with depomed 
the million increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to the expansion of our commercial presence  including expenses associated with our contract sales organization agreement with inventiv entered into in late and costs related to our sales and marketing personnel resulting from an increase in headcount 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was also attributable to increased stock based compensation expense associated with the stock option vesting acceleration on november  additionally  an increase in costs associated with advertising and promotional activities including product samples contributed to the increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million in  million in and million in the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to lower interest income resulting from lower average cash balances and a lower rate of return on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
this decrease resulted primarily from our net loss for  adjusted for non cash stock based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities  as well as our million upfront payment to depomed in july in addition  due to the illiquid state of our auction rate securities  or ars  we reclassified the fair value of these securities from short term to long term investments in these decreases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were offset in part by the million draw down on our revolving credit facility with comerica bank  or comerica  in december our ars are aaa rated municipal debt obligations with a long term maturity and an interest rate that is reset in short term intervals every days through auctions 
due to conditions in the global credit markets  in  these securities  representing a par value of million  had insufficient demand resulting in multiple failed auctions 
as a result  these affected securities are currently not liquid and the interest rates have been reset to predetermined higher rates 
in october  we received an offer of auction rate securities rights  or ars rights  from our investment provider  ubs financial services  inc  a subsidiary of ubs ag  or ubs 
in november  we accepted the ars rights offer 
the ars rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time during the period of june  through july  if we do not exercise our ars rights  the ars will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction fails 
if the ars rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further obligation to buy our ars 
ubs has the discretion to purchase or sell our ars at any time without prior notice so long as we receive a payment at par upon any sale or disposition 
ubs will only exercise its discretion to purchase or sell our ars for the purpose of restructurings  dispositions or other solutions that will provide us with par value for our ars 
as a condition to accepting the offer of ars rights  we released ubs from all claims except claims for consequential damages relating to its marketing and sales of ars 
we also agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund 
typically the fair value of ars approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars at the maximum contractual rates  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars and our ars rights as of december  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding period of the ars and ars rights 
we elected to measure the ars rights under the fair value option of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fasb statement no 
 and recognized a gain of approximately million and recorded a corresponding long term investment 
reflecting our intent to exercise the ars rights during the period of june  through july   we transferred our ars from investments available for sale to trading securities 
as a result of this transfer and as we no longer intend to hold the ars until the fair value recovers  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of approximately million  representing a reversal of the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded in other comprehensive loss 
we believe this loss is primarily attributable to the limited liquidity of these investments and have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers are presently at risk of default 
the recording of the fair value of the ars rights and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss resulted in a net impact to the statement of operations for the year ended december  of approximately  which was recorded as a reduction to interest income 
net cash used in operating activities was million for  million for and million for the primary use of cash was to fund our net losses for these periods  adjusted for non cash expenses  including million related to the issuance of common stock to cosmo in connection with our strategic collaboration entered into in  million for  million for and million for in stock based compensation  million for   for and  in depreciation and amortization and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
significant working capital uses of cash for included decreases in 
table of contents deferred revenue and increases in accounts receivable and other current assets 
these working capital uses of cash were offset in part by increases in the allowance for product returns and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily driven by an increase in accrued rebates and accrued research and development expenses associated with our strategic collaboration with cosmo 
significant working capital sources of cash for included increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily driven by an increase in accrued rebates  and increases in the allowance for product returns and deferred revenue 
these working capital sources of cash were offset in part by increases in accounts receivable 
significant working capital sources of cash for included increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue related to the million upfront license fee we received in connection with our license agreement with schering plough 
these working capital sources of cash were offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and inventories  which resulted from our overall increase in net product sales due to the launch of zegerid capsules in  and decreases in the allowance for product returns 
net cash used in investing activities was million for and million for  and net cash provided by investing activities was million for these activities consisted of purchases and sales and maturities of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment

in  net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock in connection with draw downs under our committed equity financing facility with kingsbridge capital limited 
additionally  net cash provided by financing activities included proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and through the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan in  and while we support the commercialization of our zegerid products  promote glumetza under our promotion agreement with depomed  develop and manufacture our zegerid products and our budesonide mmx and rifamycin sv mmx product candidates under our strategic collaboration with cosmo and pursue new product opportunities  we anticipate significant cash requirements for personnel costs for our own organization  as well as in connection with our contract sales agreement with inventiv  advertising and promotional activities  clinical trial costs  capital expenditures  and investment in additional office space  internal systems and infrastructure 
we currently rely on norwich pharmaceuticals  inc as our manufacturer of zegerid capsules and patheon  inc as our manufacturer of zegerid powder for oral suspension 
we also purchase commercial quantities of omeprazole  an active ingredient in our zegerid products  from union quimico farmaceutica  sa at december   we had finished goods and raw materials inventory purchase commitments of approximately million 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december   excluding potential sales based royalty obligations and milestone payments under our agreements with the university of missouri  depomed and cosmo which are described below payments due by period less than one to four to contractual obligations total one year three years five years thereafter in thousands operating leases other long term contractual obligations total under our exclusive worldwide license agreement with the university of missouri entered into in january  we are required to make milestone payments to the university of missouri upon initial commercial sale in specified territories outside the us  which may total up to million in the aggregate 
we are also required to make milestone payments based on first time achievement of significant sales thresholds  up to a maximum of million  the first of which is a million milestone payment upon initial achievement of million in annual calendar year sales  which includes sales by us  gsk and schering plough 
this initial million sales milestone was earned in and is payable to the university of missouri in the first quarter of we are also obligated to pay royalties on net sales of our products and any products commercialized by gsk under our license and distribution agreements and schering plough under our otc license agreement 

table of contents under our promotion agreement with depomed entered into in july  we may be required to pay depomed one time sales milestones totaling up to million in aggregate 
under the promotion agreement  we are required to meet certain minimum promotion obligations during the term of the agreement 
we began promoting the glumetza products in october for a period of one year from the date we began promoting the glumetza products  we are required to deliver a minimum number of sales calls to potential glumetza prescribers 
following the end of that one year period  for a period of three years  we are required to make specified minimum sales force expenditures 
in addition  during the term of the agreement  we are required to make certain minimum marketing  advertising  medical affairs and other commercial support expenditures  including an initial commitment of million in promotional costs from signing through march  under our license agreement  stock issuance agreement and registration rights agreement with cosmo entered into in december  we may pay cosmo up to a total of million in clinical and regulatory milestones for the initial indications for the licensed products  up to million in clinical and regulatory milestones for a second indication for rifamycin sv mmx and up to million in commercial milestones 
the milestones may be paid in cash or through issuance of additional shares of our common stock  at cosmo s option  subject to certain limitations 
we will pay tiered royalties to cosmo ranging from to on net sales of any licensed products we sell 
we will be responsible for one half of the total out of pocket costs associated with the two ongoing budesonide mmx multi center phase iii clinical trials and for all of the out of pocket costs for the planned rifamycin sv mmx phase iii us registration trial 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on market acceptance of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension  the glumetza products and any other products that we may market in the future  the resources we devote to researching  developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products  and our ability to enter into third party collaborations 
any adverse outcome in the litigation against par could result in one or more generic versions of zegerid capsules and or zegerid powder for oral suspension being launched before the expiration of the listed patents in july  which could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to maximize the value of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension and would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations  including causing a significant decrease in our revenues and cash flows 
an adverse outcome may also impact the patent protection for the products being commercialized pursuant to our strategic alliances with gsk and schering plough  which in turn may impact the amount of  or our ability to receive  milestone payments and royalties under those agreements 
although we intend to vigorously defend and enforce our patent rights  we are not able to predict the outcome of the litigation 
in addition  even if we prevail  the litigation will be costly  time consuming and distracting to management  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next months  however  our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our cash resources being consumed earlier than we expect 
although we do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds to finance our current operations over the next months  we may pursue raising additional funds in connection with licensing or acquisition of new products 
sources of additional funds may include funds generated through strategic collaborations or licensing agreements  or through equity  debt and or royalty financing 
in november  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  which was declared effective in december the universal shelf registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement that expired in december the universal shelf registration statement may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to an additional approximately million of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include the progress of our commercial and development activities  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets  among others 

table of contents in july  we entered into our loan agreement with comerica  which was subsequently amended in july  pursuant to which we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed million 
in december  we drew down million under the loan agreement 
the revolving loan bears interest at a variable rate of interest  per annum  most recently announced by comerica as its prime rate plus  which as of december  was 
interest payments on advances made under the loan agreement are due and payable in arrears on the first calendar day of each month during the term of the loan agreement 
amounts borrowed under the loan agreement may be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to july  there is a non refundable unused commitment fee equal to per annum on the difference between the amount of the revolving line and the average daily balance outstanding thereunder during the term of the loan agreement  payable quarterly in arrears 
the loan agreement will remain in full force and effect for so long as any obligations remain outstanding or comerica has any obligation to make credit extensions under the loan agreement 
amounts borrowed under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our personal property  excluding intellectual property 
under the loan agreement  we are subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to undergo certain change of control events  to convey  sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets  to create  incur  assume  guarantee or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness  to grant liens  to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments  and to make investments 
in addition  under the loan agreement  we are required to maintain a balance of cash with comerica in an amount of not less than million and to maintain any other cash balances with either comerica or another financial institution covered by a control agreement for the benefit of comerica 
we are also subject to specified financial covenants with respect to a minimum liquidity ratio and  in specified limited circumstances  minimum ebitda requirements 
we have currently met all of our obligations under the loan agreement 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate to sustain our current operations 
to the extent we require additional funding  we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
for example  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through collaboration  licensing or other similar arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
if adequate funds are not available on terms acceptable to us at that time  our ability to continue our current operations or pursue new product opportunities would be significantly limited 
in addition  our results of operations could be materially affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many negative ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election

the retrospective presentation and disclosure requirements of this statement will be applied to any prior periods presented in financial statements for the fiscal year ending december   and later periods during which we have a consolidated subsidiary with a noncontrolling interest 
as of december   we do not have any consolidated subsidiaries in which there is a noncontrolling interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the terms of our loan agreement with comerica bank  or comerica  the interest rate applicable to any amounts borrowed by us under the credit facility will be  at our election  indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
if we elect comerica s prime rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  the interest rate will be variable  which would expose us to the risk of increased interest expense if interest rates rise 
if we elect the libor rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  such libor rate will remain fixed only for a specified  limited period of time after the date of our election  after which we will be required to repay the borrowed amount  or elect a new interest rate indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
the new rate may be higher than the earlier interest rate applicable under the loan agreement 
as of december   the balance outstanding under the credit facility was million  and we had elected the prime rate plus interest rate option  which was as of december  under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate under the loan agreement would not materially affect our interest expense at our current level of borrowing 
in addition to market risk related to our loan agreement with comerica  we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in us interest rates and conditions in the credit markets  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our short term investment securities consist of high grade corporate debt securities and government agency securities which are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at estimated market value 
as of december   our long term investments included aaa rated auction rate securities  or ars  issued by state municipalities 
our ars are debt instruments with a long term maturity and an interest rate that is reset in short term intervals through auctions 
the conditions in the global credit markets have prevented many investors from liquidating their holdings of ars because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to predetermined higher rates 
when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or mature 
due to conditions in the global credit markets  in  our ars  representing a par value of approximately million  had insufficient demand resulting in multiple failed auctions 
as a result  these affected securities are currently not liquid and the interest rates have been reset to predetermined higher rates 
in october  we received an offer of auction rate securities rights  or ars rights  from our investment provider  ubs financial services  inc  a subsidiary of ubs ag  or ubs 
in november  we accepted the ars rights offer 
the ars rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time during the period of june  through july  if we do not exercise our ars rights  the ars will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction fails 
if the ars rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further obligation to buy our ars 
ubs has the discretion to purchase or sell our ars at any time without prior notice so long as we receive a payment at par upon any sale or disposition 
ubs will only exercise its discretion to purchase or sell our ars for the purpose of restructurings  dispositions or other solutions that will provide us with par value for our ars 
as a condition to accepting the offer of ars rights  we released ubs from all claims except claims for consequential damages relating to its marketing and sales of ars 
we also agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund 

table of contents in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without the likely loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  then we may be required to hold them to maturity 
we do not believe we have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
our results of operations could be materially affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward
