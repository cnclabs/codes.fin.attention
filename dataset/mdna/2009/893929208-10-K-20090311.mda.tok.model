actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that none of these accounting policies are extraordinarily complex or require an unusual degree of judgment as these policies relate to the company s operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report

table of contents critical accounting estimates which are material to registrant a critical accounting estimate meets two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  also reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions based on knowledge of current events and actions  however  actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   the company reported goodwill and intangible assets at carrying amounts of million and million  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of total assets as of december  intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the goodwill and intangible assets are associated with two acquisitions during and one during management reviews goodwill and intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  management calculates the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill and intangibles relate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
as of december   the company operates in one reporting unit medical transcription services 
the approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
management bases estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimate 
deferred tax asset net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   the company has approximately million of federal net operating loss carry forwards resulting in a combined federal and state deferred tax asset of million 
deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits expected to be able to apply against future taxable income 
the company s ability to utilize deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires the company to record a valuation allowance against any deferred income tax benefits that management believes may expire before sufficient taxable income is generated to use them 
the company uses current estimates of future taxable income to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
projecting future taxable income requires the use of significant judgment regarding expected future revenues and expenses 
in addition  the company must assume that tax laws will not change sufficiently to materially impact the expected tax liability associated with expected taxable income 
as of december   the company determined that it was more likely than not that  of the deferred tax assets would not be realized prior to the expiration of state net operating loss carry forwards 
accordingly  a valuation allowance of  against these deferred tax assets has been established 
in  it was determined that  except for certain deferred tax assets resulting from state net operating loss carry forwards  it will be more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be able to be utilized in the future and accordingly  the valuation allowance was reduced to zero related to those assets 
legal proceedings 
from time to time  the company is party to litigation 
on january   the company reached a mediated settlement with our lady of the lakes hospital  inc olol which was finalized on february  under the settlement  olol released all claims  in contract and in tort  which were asserted or could have been asserted in the litigation against transcend 
in return  the company agreed to pay  which was accrued at december  and paid in the first quarter of  to olol and released all claims under the company s counterclaim against olol

the company had federal pre tax net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease obligations discussed below  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period s total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total includes projected interest payments

net cash used in financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the million paid in was due primarily to the company making the final installment of million on the mdi promissory note 
the company anticipates that cash on hand  together with cash flows from operations should be sufficient for the next twelve months to finance operations  make capital investments in the ordinary course of business  and pay indebtedness when due 
in light of the current state of the credit market  the company must consider the impact of the potential inability of the company to renew or replace its existing credit facility on acceptable terms and conditions with hfg or another financial institution upon expiration of the current credit facility on december  the company does not anticipate the need to have or use any credit facility in the next twelve months to finance operations or make capital investments in the ordinary course of business 
part of the growth strategy for transcend is the completion of acquisitions 
management believes that available cash and the hfg credit facility until expiration on december  together with other acquisition options  such as owner financing  are sufficient to complete small acquisitions  but insufficient for the full execution of the company s acquisition strategy 
additional financing will be required for larger acquisitions 
transcend has not needed to access the credit markets for additional acquisition funding  and it is uncertain to what degree the company can obtain acquisition financing should the need arise 
management s assessment of the current economic environment the us economy has deteriorated significantly in recent months  stemming primarily from the disruptions in the global credit markets 
if the economy were to further deteriorate  the company could see deterioration in collection of its accounts receivable 
in addition  the decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from the financial crisis  as well as general unfavorable economic conditions  could also cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending  including spending for medical care 
it is also uncertain what effect the credit crisis may have on the security of the us banking system  and specifically the bank where the company s cash and cash equivalents are deposited 
in addition  fdic insurance does not adequately insure deposits  and it is estimated that million of the company s cash and cash equivalents were not insured at december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas  business combinations 
however  sfas r requires that acquisition costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and also requires the recognition of assets and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date 
sfas r is effective for the fiscal year beginning january  this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital  depending on the circumstances 
the statement also requires that a company account for the potential tax effects of temporary differences  carry forwards  and any income tax uncertainties of the company acquired that exist at the acquisition date or that arise as a result of the acquisition in accordance with statement  as amended  and related interpretative guidance  including fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the adoption of sfas r will likely have a significant impact on the accounting for any acquisitions completed after the effective date of the pronouncement 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement sfas requires enhanced disclosures regarding how a an entity uses derivative instruments  b derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and c derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  with early application being encouraged 
the company does not have any derivative instruments nor is it currently involved in hedging activities and therefore adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
 which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fsp requires an entity that is estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset to consider its historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension that are both consistent with the asset s highest and best use and adjusted for entity specific factors under sfas no 
the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
the company does not expect the adoption of fsp fas no 
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in financial statements that are presented in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles for nongovernmental entities 
sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company to date 
however  the effects of inflation on future operating results will depend in part on the company s ability to increase prices or lower expenses  or both  in amounts that offset inflationary cost increases 
contract prices are generally fixed for the duration of the contractual period and typically do not provide for price increases over the term of the contract  which usually extends from one to three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company had no material exposure to market risk from derivatives or other financial instruments as of december  the company does have a floating rate of interest on its credit facility with hfg 
as the company had  outstanding debt with hfg at december   a increase in the interest rate would not significantly increase interest expense
