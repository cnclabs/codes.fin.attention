item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all expectations  forecasts  assumptions  and beliefs about our future financial results  condition  operations  strategic plans  and performance are forward looking statements  as described in more detail in part i  item under the heading forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in part i  item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing of this form k with the sec  and may be relied upon only as of that date 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview forest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of natural gas and liquids primarily in north america 
forest was incorporated in new york in  as the successor to a company formed in  and has been a publicly held company since we currently conduct our operations in three geographical segments and five business units 
the geographical segments are the united states  canada  and international 
the business units are western  eastern  southern  canada  and international 
we conduct exploration and development activities in each of our geographical segments  however  substantially all of our estimated proved reserves and all of our producing properties are located in north america 
forest s total estimated proved reserves as of december  were approximately  bcfe 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves were in the united states  approximately were in canada  and approximately were in italy 
highlights forest s highlights were as follows oil and gas production in increased to bcfe from bcfe in and oil and natural gas revenues increased to billion from billion in forest s year end estimated proved reserves were a record  bcfe  higher than s year end estimated proved reserves of  bcfe  as a result of current year acquisitions and additional discoveries despite negative reserve revisions of bcfe due primarily to significantly lower year end spot prices 
the significant decline in year end spot prices triggered a non cash billion billion after tax ceiling test write down as of december  completed several key acquisitions of oil and gas properties in our existing core areas in the texas panhandle  east texas  north louisiana  and south texas 
in total  we acquired bcfe of estimated proved reserves for approximately billion during see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our recent acquisition program 
sold non core oil and gas properties with estimated proved reserves of bcfe for cash proceeds of million  including million for our unproven oil and gas properties in gabon 
strategy and outlook due to the recent downturn in the global economy as well as the dramatic decrease in oil and natural gas prices  we have chosen to significantly reduce our capital expenditures and drilling activity in our goal in will be to keep our exploration and development capital expenditures within our cash flow from operations  while maintaining our estimated proved reserve base and production  protecting against lease expirations and non consent penalties  and continuing to focus on cost control 

table of contents we plan to devote over one third of our capital spending in to horizontal drilling in our ark la tex and greater buffalo wallow core areas 
we expect this horizontal drilling to generate rates of return acceptable to us in the current price and cost environment 
we also plan to rely almost exclusively on our drilling subsidiary  lantern  to drill our wells rather than employing third party drilling rigs whenever possible 
we have a divestiture program which was commenced in with an announced intention to sell million to million of oil and gas assets that are considered non core to forest 
due to the current economic conditions  this program has been delayed 
we hope to complete these divestitures by the end of  assuming market conditions and property valuations improve  but cannot predict whether we will be able to complete any asset divestitures 
if divestitures are completed  we intend to use the proceeds to reduce debt 
by keeping our capital spending within our cash flow from operations  we hope to maintain financial flexibility and sufficient liquidity to maintain our assets and operations until margins on oil and gas production improve 
in order to preserve significant borrowing capacity and flexibility under our bank credit facilities  we recently issued million in senior notes due and used the net proceeds to pay down borrowings on the facilities 
due to the decline in the market price for oil and natural gas  forest believes that our earnings and operating cash flow will decrease significantly compared to we also expect equipment  service  and fuel costs to decrease  but not enough to offset the decline in oil and natural gas revenues 
results of operations for the year ended december   forest reported a net loss of billion  or a loss of per basic share  compared to net earnings of million  or earnings of per basic share  in the decrease in net earnings in compared to was due to a billion billion after tax non cash ceiling test impairment we recorded in the fourth quarter  which was caused by the significant decline in year end spot commodity prices 
the ceiling test impairment offset significant increases in revenues  which had resulted from higher volumes at increased oil and natural gas prices 
for each of the years ended december  and  forest reported net earnings of million  or per basic share in and per basic share in earnings from operations were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  earnings from operations in were million higher than in primarily due to higher revenues attributable mainly to the acquisition of houston exploration in june discussion of the components of the changes in our annual results follows 
comparability between and  as well as between and  was significantly impacted by our acquisition of houston exploration in june and the sale of the alaska assets in august details for the acquisition and divestiture transactions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements

production volumes and oil and gas revenues net oil and gas production in was bcfe  or an average of mmcfe per day  a increase from bcfe  or an average of mmcfe per day  in the net increase in oil and gas production in was primarily attributable to continued drilling and acquisition activity  partially offset by normal production declines on existing wells and the sale of the alaska assets in august oil and natural gas revenues in were billion  a increase as compared to billion in the increase in oil and natural gas revenues of million was due to the increase in production and a increase in the average realized sales price  which increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in net oil and gas production in was bcfe  or an average of mmcfe per day  a increase from bcfe  or an average of mmcfe per day  in the net increase in oil and gas production was primarily attributable to the additional production from drilling activities and from the houston exploration acquisition in june  which was partially offset by the spin off of our offshore gulf of mexico properties in early march  the sale of the alaska assets in august  and normal production declines on existing wells 
oil and natural gas revenues before hedging effects in were billion  a increase as compared to million in the increase in oil and natural gas revenues before hedging effects of million was due to the increase in production  offset by a decrease in the average realized sales price before the effects of hedging  to per mcfe in from per mcfe in hedge effects the table above also presents the effects of the derivative instruments eg  commodity swaps and collars that we designated as cash flow hedges in beginning in march  we elected to discontinue the use of cash flow hedge accounting for all of our commodity derivatives

per mcfe in from per mcfe in lease operating expenses were million in  an increase of compared to million in on a per mcfe basis  lease operating expenses decreased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in the decrease in lease operating expenses on a per mcfe basis for each period was primarily due to lower average per unit lease operating expenses from the assets acquired from houston exploration in june  the divestiture of the alaska assets in august  and cost control initiatives 
production and property taxes production and property taxes  which primarily consist of severance taxes paid on the value of the oil and gas produced  generally fluctuate proportionately to our oil and gas revenues 
as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenue  excluding hedging losses included as a reduction of oil and natural gas revenues in  production and property taxes were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
normal fluctuations will occur between periods based on the approval of incentive tax credits in texas  changes in tax rates  and changes in the assessed values of property and equipment for purposes of ad valorem taxes 
transportation and processing costs transportation and processing costs were million  or

the percentage of general and administrative costs capitalized under the full cost method of accounting remained relatively constant between the three years  ranging between and 
forest recorded stock based compensation cost in the amount of million in  million in  and million in  of which approximately million in was attributed to a partial settlement of forest s restricted stock awards and phantom stock unit awards in connection with the spin off 
the increase in stock based compensation of million in from was primarily due to stock based awards granted in the decrease in stock based compensation of million in from was due to the million partial settlement in  partially offset by the recognition of stock based compensation associated with restricted stock and stock options granted in depreciation and depletion  undeveloped properties year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data depreciation and depletion expense depreciation and depletion expense per mcfe depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense dd a increased

the increase in the total unproved properties of million in from million in is primarily attributable to the houston exploration acquisition completed in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on acquisitions and divestitures 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion expense of million in  million in  and million in was related to the accretion of forest s asset retirement obligations pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement obligation is required to be accreted each period to its present value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our asset retirement obligations 
impairment of oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter of  forest recorded a ceiling test impairment of its us oil and gas properties pursuant to the ceiling test limitation prescribed by the sec for companies using the full cost method of accounting 
the write down totaled billion billion after tax and was primarily a result of a significant decline in oil and gas prices in the fourth quarter of additional write downs of the full cost pools in the united states and canada may be required in if oil and gas prices continue to decline  unproved property values decrease  estimated proved reserve volumes are revised downward or costs incurred in exploration  development  or acquisition activities in the respective full cost pools exceed the discounted future net cash flows from the additional reserves  if any  attributable to each of the cost pools 
the december  nymex spot prices for natural gas and oil were per mmbtu and per barrel  respectively  and spot prices have declined since then 
based on current prices as of february   it is likely we will record an additional ceiling test impairment in the first quarter of forest also recorded impairments related to its international properties of million in  including million related to a dry hole drilled in gabon and million related to expired concessions in italy 

table of contents gain on sale of assets in  forest recognized a million gain on the sale of all of its unproven oil and gas properties in gabon for net proceeds of million 
in  forest sold its overriding royalty interests in australia for net proceeds of million  which resulted in a gain on the sale of million 
interest expense the following table summarizes interest expense incurred during the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands interest costs interest costs capitalized interest expense interest expense in totaled million compared to million the million increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased interest expense on the credit facilities  which was caused by higher average borrowings throughout the year  offset somewhat by lower interest rates 
interest expense also increased given the fact that the million of senior notes that were issued in june in conjunction with the houston exploration acquisition were outstanding for all of  however  this increase was offset by decreased interest expense associated with alaska credit agreements which were paid off in august interest capitalization increased by million due to higher interest costs and larger investments in unproved properties in as compared to interest costs related to significant unproved properties that are under development are capitalized to oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
interest expense in totaled million compared to million the million increase in interest in from is primarily due to the million of senior notes that we issued in june and the alaska credit agreements  which were entered into in december and were paid off in august the increase in interest capitalized in from is due to the acquisition of houston exploration  which also included a large investment in unproved properties 
realized and unrealized gains and losses derivative instruments the table below sets forth realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives recognized under other income and expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 
since march  when forest elected to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting for all of its derivative instruments  forest has recognized all unrealized mark to market gains and losses as a gain or loss on derivative instruments in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  cash settlements  or realized gains and losses  on derivative instruments are also recorded as a gain or loss on derivative instruments in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations

since the intercompany debt is denominated in us dollars  the strengthening of the us dollar in and resulted in an unrealized foreign exchange loss in those years 
conversely  the weakening of the us dollar in resulted in unrealized foreign currency exchange gains in realized foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to repayments of the indebtedness to forest oil corporation by our canadian subsidiary

the unrealized losses on other investments relate to fair value adjustments to the shares of pacific energy resources  ltd 
common stock and a zero coupon senior subordinated note due from pacific energy resources  ltd 
that were each received as a portion of the total consideration for the sale of our alaska assets 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these investments 

table of contents other income and expense the components of other income and expense for the years ended december    and were as follows year ended december  in thousands franchise taxes share of income of equity method investee debt extinguishment costs other  net total other expense  net franchise taxes are taxes paid to various states based on capital investment deployed in those states  determined by apportioning total capital as defined by statute 
forest s share of income of equity method investee related to our ownership of a pipeline company that transports crude oil in alaska  which was included in the sale of the alaska assets in august debt extinguishment costs in related to the complete repayment of the alaska credit agreements and included million in prepayment premiums and million of unamortized debt issue costs 
income tax the table below sets forth forest s total income tax from continuing operations and effective tax rates for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands  except percentages current income tax deferred income tax total income tax effective tax rate our combined us and canadian effective tax rate generally approximates to but will fluctuate based on the percentage of pre tax income generated in the us versus canada 
our effective rate in was due to a reduction in income taxes of approximately million related to statutory rate reductions enacted in canada  the release of valuation allowances  and a lower apportioned effective state income tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our income taxes at the statutory rate to income taxes at our effective rate for each period presented 
results of discontinued operations on march   the assets and business operations of our canadian marketing subsidiary were sold and the subsidiary s results of operations were reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  forest received an additional million contingent payment million net of tax from the buyer  which is also reflected as income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our exploration  development  and acquisition activities require us to make significant operating and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash flow from operations and our bank credit facilities as our primary sources of liquidity 
to fund large and other exceptional transactions  such as acquisitions and debt refinancing transactions  we have looked to the private and public capital markets as another source of financing and  as market conditions have permitted  we have engaged in asset monetization transactions 
changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact our level of cash flow generated from operations 
currently  natural gas accounts for approximately of our estimated proved reserves and  as a result  our operations and cash flow are more sensitive to fluctuations in the price for natural gas 
we employ a hedging strategy in order to try to minimize the adverse effects of wide fluctuations in commodity prices on our cash flow 
as of february   we had hedged  via commodity swaps and collar instruments  approximately bcfe of our production and bcfe of our production 
this level of hedging will provide a measure of certainty of the cash flow that we will receive for a portion of our production in and in the future  we may determine to increase or decrease our hedging positions 
as of february   all of our derivatives counterparties were commercial banks that are parties to our credit facilities  or their affiliates 
see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk below for further details concerning our hedging activities 
the other primary sources of liquidity include our us credit facility and our canadian credit facility  which had combined commitments totaling billion as of december  these facilities are used to fund daily operations and to fund acquisitions and refinance debt  as needed and if available 
the credit facilities are secured by our assets and mature in june see the heading bank credit facilities below for further details 
the public and private capital markets have served as our primary source of financing to fund large acquisitions and other exceptional transactions 
in the past  we have issued debt and equity in both the public and private capital markets 
for example  on february   we issued million principal amount of senior notes due in a private offering  and in  we issued million principal amount of additional senior notes in a private offering 
our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets on economical terms is affected by general economic conditions  the domestic and global financial markets  the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies  our operational and financial performance  the value and performance of our equity and debt securities  prevailing commodity prices  and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
notwithstanding that we recently completed a million issuance of senior notes  the continuing economic crisis and distressed financial markets have impacted our business and limited our ability to access the capital markets on economical terms as funding from these markets has diminished significantly 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  the capital markets were essentially frozen and not available to forest on terms we found acceptable  however  in february we were able to issue million of new senior notes in a private offering 
we cannot be certain that funding will be available to us in the debt and equity markets in the future  if needed  nor can we be certain that such funding will be available on acceptable terms 
we also have engaged in asset dispositions as a means of generating additional cash to fund expenditures and enhance our financial flexibility 
for example  during  we sold certain non strategic assets for total proceeds of approximately million 
however  due to significant declines in oil and natural gas prices and the turmoil in the financial and credit markets over the last year  the level of activity in the market for oil and gas properties has greatly diminished  as has the pool of available buyers 
we intend to pursue asset dispositions in the future  including our previously announced intention to sell million to million of non core properties 
due to the current 
table of contents economic conditions  however  this program has been delayed 
we hope to complete these divestitures by year end  assuming market conditions and property valuations improve  but cannot predict whether we will be able to complete any asset divestitures 
we believe that our cash flow provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditures budget  and our short term contractual obligations during however  if our revenue and cash flow decrease in the future as a result of further deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions and a continuation of declining commodity prices  we may have to reduce further our spending levels 
we believe that this financial flexibility to adjust our spending levels will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations should economic conditions not improve during see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and financial and operating results 
bank credit facilities as of december   we had syndicated bank revolving credit agreements with total lender commitments of billion 
the commitments under the credit agreements consisted of a billion us credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na the na credit facility and a million canadian credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  toronto branch the canadian credit facility  and together with the us credit facility  the credit facilities 
the credit facilities will mature in june forest s availability under the credit facilities is governed by a borrowing base the global borrowing base 
the determination of the global borrowing base is made by the lenders  applying their own assumptions in their sole discretion  taking into consideration the estimated value of forest s oil and gas properties based on pricing models determined by the lenders at such time  in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
the global borrowing base is redetermined semi annually  and the available borrowing amount could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations 
in addition to the semi annual redeterminations  forest and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during any calendar year  to have the global borrowing base redetermined 
because the process for determining the global borrowing base involves evaluating the estimated value of our oil and gas properties using pricing models determined by the lenders at that time  the recent decline in oil and gas commodity prices  or a further decline in those prices  could result in a determination to decrease the global borrowing base in the future 
the global borrowing base is also subject to change in the event i we issue senior notes  in which case the global borrowing base will immediately be reduced by an amount equal to for every principal amount of any newly issued senior notes  excluding any senior notes that we may issue to refinance senior notes that were outstanding on may   or ii if we sell oil and natural gas properties included in the global borrowing base having a fair market value in excess of of the global borrowing base then in effect 
the global borrowing base is subject to other automatic adjustments under the facilities 
as a result of issuing million of senior notes due in february  our borrowing base was lowered from billion to billion effective february  as a result of the adjustment to the global borrowing base  we reallocated amounts under the us credit facility and canadian credit facility and currently have allocated billion to the us credit facility and million to the canadian credit facility 
a lowering of the global borrowing base could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the global borrowing base in order to cover the deficiency 
the automatic lowering of the global borrowing base on february  did not result in any deficiency  and therefore we did not have to repay any amounts 
borrowings under the us credit facility bear interest at one of two rates as may be elected by forest 
loans will bear interest at a rate that is based on interest rates applicable to dollar deposits in 
table of contents the london interbank market libo rate  or a rate based on the greater of the prime rate announced by the global administrative agent or the federal funds rate plus of 
loans under the canadian credit facility will bear interest at a rate that may be based on the base rate announced by the canadian administrative agent  the libo rate  a rate based on the greater of the rate for us dollar denominated loans made by the canadian administrative agent and the federal funds rate plus of  or a banker s acceptance rate 
the credit facilities include various covenants and restrictive provisions that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers  and acquisitions  and also include financial covenants 
if we were to fail to perform our obligations under these covenants or other covenants and obligations  it could cause an event of default and the credit facilities could be terminated and amounts outstanding could be declared immediately due and payable by the lenders  subject to notice and cure periods in certain cases 
such events of default include non payment  breach of warranty  non performance of financial covenants  default on other indebtedness  certain pension plan events  certain adverse judgments  change of control  a failure of the liens securing the credit facilities  and an event of default under the canadian credit facility 
in addition  bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to forest or certain of its subsidiaries will result in an automatic acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facilities 
an acceleration of our indebtedness under the credit facilities could in turn result in an event of default under the indentures for our senior notes  which in turn could result in the acceleration of the senior notes 
for example  the indentures for our senior notes due and our senior notes due include as events of default  among others  a default on indebtedness that results in the acceleration of indebtedness in an amount greater than million  each of the indentures for our senior notes due and our senior notes due include a similar event of default if the amount involved is greater than million 
the credit facilities are collateralized by a portion of our assets 
we are required to mortgage and grant a security interest in the greater of of the present value of our consolidated proved oil and gas properties  or multiplied by the allocated us borrowing base 
we also have pledged the stock of several subsidiaries to the lenders to secure the credit facilities 
under certain circumstances  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if forest s corporate credit ratings assigned by moody s and s p improve and meet pre established levels  the collateral requirements would not apply and  at our request  the banks would release their liens and security interests on our properties 
in addition to these collateral requirements  one of our subsidiaries  forest oil permian corporation  is a subsidiary guarantor of the credit facilities 
the lending group under our us credit facility includes the following institutions jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan chase  bank of america  na bank of america  citibank  na citibank  bnp paribas  bmo capital markets financing  inc bmo  credit suisse  cayman islands branch credit suisse  deutsche bank ag new york branch deutsche bank  us bank national association  the bank of nova scotia bank of nova scotia  fortis capital corp

table of contents these eight lenders holding an equal share 
with respect to the other of the total commitments  no single lender holds more than of the total commitments 
from time to time  we engage in other transactions with a number of the lenders under the credit facilities 
such lenders or their affiliates may serve as underwriter or initial purchaser of our debt and equity securities  act as agent or directly purchase our production  or serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements 
as of february   our primary derivative counterparties included the following lenders and their affiliates bmo  bnp paribas  barclays  credit suisse  deutsche bank  fortis  bank of nova scotia  toronto dominion  and wells fargo 
as of february   our derivative transactions with bmo  credit suisse  fortis  bank of nova scotia  bnp paribas  and toronto dominion account for approximately bcfe  or of our hedged production  and bcfe  or of our hedged production 
our obligations under our existing derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under our credit facilities 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk  below for additional details concerning our derivative arrangements 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of billion under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of  and there were outstanding borrowings of million under the canadian credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had used the credit facilities for approximately million in letters of credit  leaving an unused borrowing amount under the credit facilities of approximately million at december  at march   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of  and there were outstanding borrowings of million under the canadian credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had used the credit facilities for approximately million in letters of credit  leaving an unused borrowing amount under the credit facilities of approximately million at march  credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating agencies 
moody s investor services and standard poor s rating services currently rate each series of our senior notes and  in addition  they have assigned forest a general credit rating 
our credit facilities include provisions that are linked to our credit ratings 
for example  our collateral requirements will vary based on our credit ratings  however  we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts due under credit facilities or the debt issued under the indentures for our senior notes 
the indentures for our senior notes also include terms linked to our credit ratings 
these terms allow us greater flexibility if our credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied  in which event we would not be obligated to comply with certain restrictive covenants included in the indentures 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities will be affected by our credit rating at the time any such financing activities are conducted 
historical cash flow net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used by investing activities  and net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december    and were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts  and changes in working capital 
the increases in net cash provided by operating activities of million in as compared to and million in as compared to were primarily due to higher production volumes and commodity prices in each of the periods being compared 
cash flows used by investing activities are primarily comprised of the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties net of dispositions of oil and gas properties

table of contents capital expenditures expenditures for property acquisitions  exploration  and development were as follows year ended december  in thousands property acquisitions proved properties unproved properties exploration direct costs overhead capitalized development direct costs overhead capitalized total capital expenditures total capital expenditures include cash expenditures  accrued cash expenditures  and non cash capital expenditures including the value of common stock issued in conjunction with property acquisitions and stock based compensation capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on property acquisitions 
total capital expenditures also include estimated discounted asset retirement obligations of million  million  and million related to assets placed in service during the years ended december    and  respectively 
due to significant changes in the overall economy as well as the price for oil and natural gas  we have chosen to significantly reduce our capital expenditures and drilling activity in compared with we intend to keep our exploration and development capital spending within our cash flows from operations and have established a capital budget of approximately million to million for the year ending december  some of the factors impacting the level of capital expenditures in include crude oil and natural gas prices  the volatility in these prices  the cost and availability of oil field services  general economic and market conditions  and weather disruptions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total in thousands bank debt senior notes operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other liabilities derivative liabilities total contractual obligations bank debt consists of the outstanding balances under our us and canadian credit facilities as of december  and the anticipated interest payments due under the terms of the credit facilities using the interest rates in effect and debt balances at december  
table of contents senior notes consist of the principal obligations on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes and anticipated interest payments due on each 
operating leases consist of leases for drilling rigs  office facilities  office equipment  and vehicles 
unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of firm commitments for drilling rigs  pipeline capacity  and seismic and tubular purchases 
other liabilities represent current and noncurrent liabilities that are comprised of benefit obligations and asset retirement obligations  for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
derivative liabilities represent the fair value of liabilities for commodity derivatives as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown  because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through  totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include i undrawn letters of credit  ii operating lease agreements  iii drilling commitments  and iv contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable  such as gas transportation commitments and derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices 
forest does not believe that any of these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
see part i  item business regulation for further information 
critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions full cost method of accounting the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in our financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  and a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability is recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using 
table of contents one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
assuming consistent production year over year  our depletion expense will be significantly higher or lower if we significantly decrease or increase our estimates of remaining proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed each quarter on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations and the effect of cash flow hedges 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash write down is required 
forest recorded a billion billion after tax ceiling test impairment in the fourth quarter of the december  nymex spot prices for natural gas and oil were per mmbtu and per barrel  respectively  and spot prices have declined since then 
based on current prices as of february   it is likely we will record an additional ceiling test impairment in the first quarter of in countries or areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
an impairment of unproved property costs may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishment of drilling rights  or other information 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  exploratory dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis 
impairments are also assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities  because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis in the second quarter of the year 
in addition  we test goodwill for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 

table of contents in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of operations 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow model to value our total estimated reserves  which include proved  probable  and possible reserves 
this approach relies on significant judgments about the quantity of reserves  the timing of the expected production  the pricing that will be in effect at the time of production  and the appropriate discount rates to be used 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of forest s weighted average cost of capital 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of  nor as a result of the non recurring test we performed in the fourth quarter of however  there can be no assurance that our goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future 
oil and gas reserve estimates our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling test limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
reference should be made to independent audit of reserves under part i  item business  and our proved reserves are estimates and depend on many assumptions 
any material inaccuracies in these assumptions could cause the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves  and our revenue  profitability  and cash flow  to be materially different from our estimates  under part i  item a risk factors  in this form k 
accounting for derivative instruments we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
under the provisions of sfas  we may or may not elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge against changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability a fair value hedge or against exposure to variability in expected future cash flows a cash flow 
table of contents hedge 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statement of operations  because changes in fair value of the derivative offsets changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
since march  we have elected not to use hedge accounting 
accordingly  after march  all changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments have been and will continue to be recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses in realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
we use the income approach in determining the fair value of our derivative instruments  utilizing present value techniques for valuing our swaps and basis swaps and option pricing models for valuing our collars 
inputs to these valuation techniques include published forward prices  volatilities  and credit risk considerations  including the incorporation of published interest rates and credit spreads 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions  or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the forward oil and natural gas prices used to calculate the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments at december  would decrease the net fair value of our commodity derivative instruments at december  by approximately million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue 
actual gains or losses recognized related to our commodity derivative instruments will likely differ from those estimated at december  and will depend exclusively on the price of the commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax assets and liabilities are generally determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the book value of income tax assets is limited to the amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in assessing the value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income during the periods in which related temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the amount of deferred tax liabilities  historical taxable income  and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets will reverse  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  
table of contents could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during relevant periods are reduced 
asset retirement obligations forest has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our asset retirement obligations aro under sfas no 
are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
hedging program in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of an oil and gas hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other financial instruments with counterparties who  in general  are participants in our credit facilities 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  we pay the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had entered into the following swaps swaps natural gas nymex hh oil nymex wti bbtu per day weighted average hedged price per mmbtu fair value in thousands barrels per day weighted average hedged price per bbl fair value in thousands calendar calendar bbtu per day is subject to a written put 
costless collars forest also enters into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index 
table of contents price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
as of december   we had entered into the following collars costless collars natural gas nymex hh bbtu per day weighted average hedged floor and ceiling price per mmbtu fair value in thousands calendar basis swaps forest also uses basis swaps in connection with natural gas swaps in order to fix the price differential between the nymex price and the index price at which the natural gas production is sold 
as of december   we had entered into the following basis swaps basis swaps bbtu per day fair value in thousands calendar calendar the fair value of all our commodity derivative instruments based on various inputs  including published forward prices  at december  was a net asset of approximately million 
in january and february  forest entered into the following additional gas swaps and basis swaps swaps basis swaps natural gas nymex hh bbtu per day weighted average hedged price per mmbtu bbtu per day february december calendar interest rate swaps forest may enter into interest rate swap agreements in an attempt to normalize the mix of fixed and floating interest rates within its debt portfolio

million 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap intended to exchange the fixed interest rate on million of the company s senior notes for a variable rate based on one month libor plus over the term of the senior notes 
fair value reconciliation the table below sets forth the changes that occurred in the fair values of our open derivative contracts during the year ended december   beginning with the fair value of our derivative contracts on december  due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue

in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily united states dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
substantially all of our canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  we believe that any currency risk associated with our canadian operations would not have a material impact on our results of operations
