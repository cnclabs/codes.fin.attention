item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our principal business is the design  manufacture  marketing  distribution and sales of physical medicine products and aesthetic products 
we manufacture and distribute a broad line of medical equipment including therapy devices  medical supplies and soft goods  treatment tables and rehabilitation equipment 
our line of aesthetic equipment includes aesthetic massage and microdermabrasion devices  as well as skin care products 
our products are sold to and used primarily by physical therapists  chiropractors  sports medicine practitioners  podiatrists  plastic surgeons  dermatologists  aestheticians and other aesthetic services providers 
we operate on a fiscal year ending june for example  reference to fiscal year refers to the year ended june  recent developments in fiscal year  we introduced a new product catalog to our customers 
with thousands of new products added to the new catalog as a result of our acquisition of distributors in  we have experienced a significant increase in medical supply sales which we attribute to the catalog 
the acquisition of six of our top distributors allowed us to greatly expand our product offering 
the new catalog contains over pages of products more than double our previous catalog offerings 
we introduced the new v force vibration therapy device to the market in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year this new unit employs powerful  whole body vibration technology  which provides neuromuscular training to increase strength  improve balance and enhance flexibility 
whole body vibration therapy has been the subject of extensive research for many years with numerous clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness in the areas of balance fall prevention  circulation  knee rehabilitation  low back pain  range of motion and a host of other neuromuscular conditions 
we also expanded our direct sales team from sales representatives in fiscal year to sales representatives by september our expanded sales force now consists of direct sales employees and independent sales representatives  helping extend our reach and grow market share 
we expect to continue to recruit experienced sales representatives and dealers as our industry experiences an ongoing period of consolidation 
in addition  we intend to recruit additional independent distributors and seasoned direct sales representatives in geographical areas where distribution has been lost or diminished due to the consolidation activities in our industry 
during fiscal year  we undertook an aggressive internal campaign to improve operating efficiencies 
with the help of vici capital partners  we identified a number of opportunities to improve cash flows and operational efficiencies  as well as to strengthen margins and reduce manufacturing and other costs 
these changes were specifically targeted at lowering transaction costs  obtaining better pricing and terms from vendors and service providers  streamlining customer service and production processes  and improving our sales support functions 
implementation of all ideas generated through this campaign is projected to yield net economic benefits of approximately  annually by the end of fiscal year how we assess the performance of our business we consider a variety of performance and financial measures in assessing the performance of our business 
the key measures for determining how our business is performing are net sales  gross profit margin and selling  general and administrative expense 
net sales net sales constitute gross sales net of any returns and sales discounts 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold 
gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net sales 
cost of goods sold for manufactured products includes direct material and labor costs as well as allocated indirect costs of labor and overhead 
cost of goods sold for distributed products includes the direct cost of purchased products  distribution center costs  and all freight costs incurred 
the components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to those of other manufacturers or distributors of similar products within our industry 
our cost of goods sold is substantially higher in higher volume quarters because cost of goods sold generally increases as net sales increase 
changes in the mix of our products  such as changes in the proportion of manufactured products  may also impact our overall cost of goods sold 
we review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow moving products in inventory 
we may offer incentives or mark downs on these products 
the timing and level of markdowns are not seasonal in nature but are driven by customer acceptance and sales 
if we misjudge the market for our products  we may be faced with excess inventories for some products and be required to mark down those products in order to sell them  however  historically markdowns have not been a material factor in our business 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes administration  share based compensation and occupancy costs 
these expenses do not generally vary proportionally with net sales 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales is usually higher in lower volume quarters and lower in higher volume quarters 
share based compensation expense related to stock options was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we granted options to purchase an aggregate of shares  and  shares of common stock in fiscal years and  respectively 
these and any future stock option grants will increase our share based compensation expense in fiscal year and in future fiscal years compared to fiscal year see critical accounting policies 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
net sales net sales decreased less than  or  to  in fiscal year  from  in fiscal year sales were essentially even in fiscal year when compared with the prior year  notwithstanding significant turmoil in the credit and financial markets and the general economic environment in the united states 
sales of medical supplies and soft goods increased as a percentage of overall sales to in fiscal year  from of sales in we believe that the introduction of our new product catalog in the first quarter of fiscal year contributed to the increase in medical supply sales 
the new product catalog contains over pages of products and is twice the size of our previous catalog 
sales of capital equipment for both rehabilitation and aesthetics markets experienced a reduction in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to the general downturn in the economy 
the decrease in capital equipment sales was mostly offset by higher sales of catalog products  medical supplies and treatment tables in fiscal year sales of manufactured physical medicine products represented approximately and of our physical medicine product sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
distribution of products manufactured by other suppliers accounted for the balance of our physical medicine product sales in those years 
this is a significant change from the product mix prior to the acquisitions in for example  in fiscal year  sales of manufactured physical medicine products represented approximately of all of our physical medicine product sales 
the introduction of our new product catalog produced increased demand for medical supplies  soft goods and distributed products in fiscal year  promoting this shift in product mix toward sales of the distributed products 
sales of manufactured aesthetic products in fiscal years and represented approximately and of our aesthetic product sales  respectively  with distributed products making up the balance 
the majority of our sales revenues come from the sales of physical medicine products  both manufactured and distributed 
in fiscal year  sales of physical medicine products accounted for of total sales  up from in fiscal year chargeable repairs  billable freight revenue and other miscellaneous revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues in and gross profit gross profit increased approximately  to  or of net sales in fiscal year  from  or of net sales in fiscal year the basis points increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal year over the prior year is attributable primarily to price increases implemented during the second fiscal quarter ended december  in addition  we implemented a number of refinements to our business operations in fiscal year which lowered our costs through better pricing and terms obtained from vendors 
these refinements contributed to the improvement in gross profit in fiscal year gross margin in fiscal year was adversely affected by the sale of inventory of manufactured products in inventory of the acquired dealers at the time of the acquisitions 
these products had been purchased from us and as a result of our acquisitions of the dealers  we acquired products with a cost basis at the higher acquired dealer cost 
this had the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for those products by approximately  in fiscal year when compared to the margin for those products had we been able to sell them at our stated cost basis instead of the acquired cost basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  or  to  or of net sales in fiscal year  from  or of net sales in fiscal year the decrease in sg a expenses in fiscal year is primarily the result of our internal aggressive cost reduction campaign to improve efficiencies 
we targeted lowering transaction costs  obtaining better pricing and terms from service providers  streamlining customer service and production processes  and improving our sales support functions 
the impact of these changes on sg a expenses for the year ended june  included o  in lower selling expenses o  in lower labor and operating costs o  in lower general and administrative expenses approximately  or  of the reduction in labor and operating costs in fiscal year resulted from the recording of a reversal of an accrued liability resulting from the cancellation of retirement benefits previously provided by contract to two executive officers  kelvyn cullimore  jr 
and larry beardall 
the benefits were cancelled when the employment agreements in which they were granted were terminated in march both executives subsequently entered into new agreements with the company in june the new agreements do not include retirement benefits such as those that had been a part of the terminated agreements 
research and development research and development r d expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal year  from  in r d expense also decreased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year  to from of net sales in fiscal year r d costs are expensed as incurred 
during fiscal  we introduced the v force vibration therapy device and began an important redesign of our main line of therapy products which is scheduled for completion next summer 
we expect to continue our commitment to developing innovative products for the physical medicine market in fiscal year and in future periods in order to position us for growth 
we anticipate that r d expense as a percentage of net sales and in absolute terms will increase in to levels similar to fiscal year pre tax income loss pre tax income improved significantly in fiscal year  to  compared to a pre tax loss of  in fiscal year the improvement in pre tax income for fiscal year was a result in part of the reduction in sg a expenses of approximately  a significant portion  approximately  of the net loss in fiscal year was due to  of goodwill impairment 
higher gross profit  lower r d expenses  and the elimination of acquisition related expenses of approximately  also contributed to the improved operating results in fiscal year additionally  expenses related to increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the reserve for obsolete inventory decreased  in fiscal year as compared to income tax expense benefit income tax expense was  in fiscal year  compared to income tax benefit of  in fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to in the lower tax accrual rate in is a result of the non deductibility of a significant portion of the write off of goodwill and certain other items 
interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased by  to  in fiscal year due to decreased borrowings and lower carrying balances on our bank line of credit 
net income loss net income increased to  
per share in fiscal year  compared to a net loss of  
per share in fiscal year major factors contributing to the improvement in fiscal year were the reduction in sg a expenses of approximately  higher gross profit generated for the year  lower r d expenses and the elimination of  of goodwill impairment incurred in fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  or  liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations through available cash reserves and borrowings under a line of credit with a bank 
working capital was  as of june   inclusive of the current portion of long term obligations and credit facilities  compared to working capital of  as of june  accounts receivable trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  or to  as of june   compared to  as of june  trade accounts receivable represent amounts due from our dealer network as well as from medical practitioners and clinics 
we believe that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on our historical knowledge and relationship with these customers 
accounts receivable are generally collected within days of the agreed terms 
as a result of increased distribution activity following the acquisitions completed in fiscal year  the character of the accounts receivable and collection patterns have changed from prior years 
we will continue to carefully monitor our collection practices to ensure the allowance estimates are adequate 
allowances for the retail accounts assumed in the acquisitions include consideration of the historical experience of the acquired companies 
inventories inventories  net of reserves  decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  as expected  inventories began to reduce following consolidation of eight distribution points to three central distribution facilities since the completion of the acquisitions in in addition  the amount of inventory we carry fluctuates each period based on the timing of large inventory purchases from overseas suppliers 
accounts payable accounts payable increased  or to  as of june   from  as of june  the increase in accounts payable is a result of the timing of our weekly payments to suppliers and the timing of purchases of product components 
accounts payable are generally not aged beyond the terms of our suppliers 
we take advantage of available early payment discounts when offered by our vendors 
accrued expenses accrued expenses decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  accrued expenses consist of accrued real property taxes and personal property taxes  sales taxes liability  accrued royalties  commissions  professional fees  directors fees  product liability deductions  interest expense and miscellaneous other expenses 
accrued payroll and benefit expenses accrued payroll and benefit expenses increased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  the increase in accrued payroll and benefit expenses is related to the number of days within a pay period that require accrual as of the end of our fiscal year 
cash and cash equivalents our cash position as of june  was  a decrease of or  from cash of  as of june  we believe that improved cash flows from operating activities will be generated through higher sales  improved management of accounts receivable  reduction of current inventory levels and reduction of operating expenses 
we expect that cash flows from operating activities  together with amounts available through an existing line of credit facility  will be sufficient to cover operating needs in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months 
if we experience an adverse operating environment  including a further worsening of the general economy in the united states  or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
line of credit during fiscal year  we paid down the outstanding balance on our line of credit with a bank by  leaving a remaining balance outstanding of  as of june   compared to  as of june  the decrease in the line of credit was primarily the result of improved collections of accounts receivable  an increase in accounts payable  profits generated during fiscal year and cash flows from operating activities 
interest on the line of credit is based on the day libor rate as of june  plus  which as of june  equaled per annum 
the line of credit is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventories  as well as a security interest in our headquarters facility in salt lake city  utah 
borrowing limitations are based on approximately of eligible inventory and up to of eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum credit facility of  interest payments on the line are due monthly 
as of june   the borrowing base was approximately  resulting in approximately  available on the line 
the line of credit is renewable on october  and includes covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of june   we were in compliance with these loan covenants 
the current ratio was to as of june  compared to to as of june  current assets represented of total assets as of june  and debt long term debt excluding current installments totaled  as of june   compared to  as of june  long term debt is comprised primarily of the mortgage loans on our office and manufacturing facilities in utah and tennessee 
the principal balance on the mortgage loans is approximately  with monthly principal and interest payments of  for a more complete explanation of the long term debt  see note in the financial statements 
inflation and seasonality our revenues and net income from continuing operations have not been unusually affected by inflation or price increases for raw materials and parts from vendors 
our business operations are not materially affected by seasonality factors 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
sfas no 
is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  we adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note t to the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives 
fsp fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fsp fas will have on our consolidated results of operation  cash flows or financial condition 
in december  sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 was issued which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
minority interests will be recharacterized as non controlling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in net income and  upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in net income 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning july  and will apply prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retrospectively 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurement 
where applicable  this statement simplifies and codifies fair value related guidance previously issued within united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  for financial assets and november  for non financial assets  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted sfas no 
on july  for our financial assets and liabilities and on july  for non financial assets with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable given the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the following reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves the nature of our business requires that we maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
we record finished goods inventory at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual costs first in  first out or market 
raw materials are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory valuation reserves are maintained for the estimated impairment of the inventory 
impairment may be a result of slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence or changes in the valuation of the inventory 
in determining the adequacy of reserves  we analyze the following  among other things o current inventory quantities on hand  o product acceptance in the marketplace  o customer demand  o historical sales  o forecast sales  o product obsolescence  o technological innovations  and o character of the inventory as a distributed item  finished manufactured item or raw material 
any modifications to estimates of inventory valuation reserves are reflected in the cost of goods sold within the statements of operations during the period in which such modifications are determined necessary by management 
as of june  and  our inventory valuation reserve balance  which established a new cost basis  was  and  respectively  and our inventory balance was  and  net of reserves  respectively 
revenue recognition historically  the majority of our product sales were to customers who were independent distributors 
in fiscal year  as a result of acquiring six of our top distributors  a significant portion of our sales were generated through our new direct sales force 
our sales force and distributors sell our products to end users  including physical therapists  professional trainers  athletic trainers  chiropractors  medical doctors and aestheticians 
with the acquisition of the key distributors  we effectively reduced our dependence on sales by independent distributors 
sales revenues are recorded when products are shipped fob shipping point under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed for shipping and handling of products are recorded as sales revenue 
costs for shipping and handling of products to customers are recorded as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
in doing so  we analyze historical bad debt trends  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  and  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
deferred income tax assets in august and august  our management performed an in depth analysis of the deferred income tax assets and their recoverability based on the criteria of sfas no 
based on several factors  including our strong earnings history of pre tax profit averaging over  per year in of the last fiscal years and the fact that the principal causes of the loss in fiscal goodwill impairment and expenses resulting from six acquisitions are considered to be unusual and are not expected to recur in the near future  we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
business plan and outlook during fiscal year  we achieved significant improvement in our operating results compared to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  we will continue to pursue a focused strategy to improve sales and overall operations that includes the following elements o strengthening distribution channels by adding direct sales representatives and dealers in key locations o developing sales with large national accounts and group purchasing organizations o refining operations by continuing to reduce overhead costs and automating processes o enhancing product profit margins through improved manufacturing processes and negotiating better pricing of components with vendors o developing and introducing new  state of the art products for future growth our goal in implementing this strategy is to improve short term profitability without jeopardizing long term growth 
the landscape of our primary market  the physical medicine marketplace  continues to change 
past years saw consolidation among manufacturers and distributors including our own acquisitions completed in fiscal years and more recently  two additional significant changes have taken place 
djo announced the closure of its chattanooga group operations and the redistribution of those manufacturing  r d and support functions to other djo facilities  in and out of the united states 
the effect is that the full operations of the former chattanooga group have been reduced to a product brand sold by djo through non proprietary distribution channels 
in addition  djo agreed to sell the catalog division of its empi subsidiary to patterson medical sammons preston 
this decision essentially eliminates empi as a significant catalog competitor and further reduces competition in the market 
these consolidations combined with prior year consolidations and continuing declines in the number of independent distributors has significantly narrowed distribution channels in our market 
at the present time  there remain only two companies with a direct sales force selling proprietary and distributed products 
those companies are dynatronics and patterson medical through its sammons preston subsidiary 
all other distributors are catalog companies with no direct sales force  or manufacturers continuing to rely on a declining network of independent dealers 
in the past year we have reinforced our direct sales team to include direct sales employees and independent sales representatives 
we believe we have the best trained and most knowledgeable sales force in the industry 
the recent changes within our market provide a unique opportunity for us to grow market share in the coming years through recruitment of the best sales representatives and dealers 
the september introduction of our first consolidated catalog and pricing schedule provided a powerful sales tool that is helping our sales efforts with direct sales representatives and independent distributors who use either a private labeled version or the proprietary version of the catalog 
we are focusing specific efforts on recruiting additional independent distributors and seasoned direct sales representatives in geographical areas where distribution has been lost or diminished due to consolidation within our industry 
with the broad line of products we now offer and a strong sales force that we expect will only grow stronger in the coming year  we believe that we are uniquely positioned to develop relationships with group purchasing organizations gpo s and large chains of hospitals and clinics that purchase only on contract 
this is a segment of business which was previously closed to us because we were not an approved vendor with the various gpo s and national or regional chains of care facilities 
with the broader offering of products now available through our catalog  we are better able to compete for this high volume business 
to further our efforts to recruit the best direct sales representatives and dealers as well as to better appeal to the large gpo s and national customers  we will continue to improve efficiencies of our operations and the sales support for the industry 
chief among those changes will be the introduction of our first true e commerce solution 
this launch is scheduled to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year with the introduction of this e commerce solution  customers will be able to more easily place orders and obtain information about their accounts 
sales representatives will be more effective with an abundance of information available to them electronically 
not only is our e commerce solution expected to improve sales  but it will significantly reduce our transactional costs thus enabling us to accommodate higher sales without significantly increasing overhead 
we will also continue to focus on new product innovation 
the introduction of v force in fiscal year once again testifies of our commitment to innovation as we are the first to introduce this technology to the rehabilitation markets we serve 
it is expected that v force will be an important contributor to sales and profits in fiscal year several new products are currently under development and are scheduled for introduction in the summer of the commitment to innovation of high quality products has been a hallmark of dynatronics and will continue to be throughout the coming year 
in april  we introduced the new synergie elite aesthetic product line  representing the first redesign of our popular aesthetic devices since their original introduction almost years ago 
we believe that this new line of products remains the best value on the market 
while the current economic conditions have dampened demand for large capital equipment purchases like the synergie elite products  we plan to seek strategic partnerships  both domestic and international  to help maintain the sales momentum from the introduction of this revised product line 
as the economy begins to improve over the coming year  we expect to see increased sales of these higher margin products 
in the meantime  expenses related to this division are being kept to a minimum 
we have long believed that international markets present an untapped potential for growth and expansion 
adding new distributors in several countries will be the key to this expansion effort 
our past efforts to improve international marketing have yielded only marginal improvements 
we remain committed  however  to finding the most cost effective ways to expand our markets internationally 
over the coming year our efforts will be focused on partnering with key manufacturers and distributors interested in our product line or technology 
our salt lake city facilities  where all electrotherapy  ultrasound  traction  light therapy and synergie products are manufactured  are certified to iso  an internationally recognized standard of excellence in medical device manufacturing 
this designation is an important requirement in obtaining the ce mark certification  which allows us to market our products in the european union and other foreign countries 
refining our business model for supporting sales representatives and distributors also will be a focal point of operations 
we will continue to evaluate the most efficient ways to maintain our satellite sales offices and warehouses 
in addition  more emphasis is being placed on pricing management to protect margins for both manufactured and distributed products 
the ongoing refinement of this model is expected to yield further efficiencies that will better achieve sales goals while at the same time reduce expenses 
through our agreement with vici capital partners over this past year  we have identified over  of efficiency improvements that either have already been implemented or that we plan to implement during fiscal year to drive greater profitability 
this is particularly important given the slow market for capital products associated with the weak national economy 
while sales in fiscal year were even with fiscal year  the trends have favored non capital equipment and supplies while the demand for capital equipment has been soft 
yet  the sale of our manufactured capital equipment remains the largest contributor to margin generation 
therefore  we have placed renewed emphasis on improving manufacturing operations including considering more offshore manufacturing of components as well as streamlining manufacturing operations in utah and tennessee 
past experience has shown that when recessionary pressures start to subside  the pent up demand for capital equipment will be significant 
expectations of the recessionary grip loosening during calendar lead us to a belief that capital equipment sales will start to rebound toward the end of fiscal year all our efforts to trim back during these difficult times should make us a leaner operation when demand ramps up once again 
based on our defined strategic initiatives  we are focusing our resources in the following areas o reinforcing distribution through a strategy of recruiting direct sales representatives and working closely with the most successful distributors of capital equipment 
o improving sales by focusing sales strategies on pursuing business opportunities with group purchasing organizations and large national and regional accounts 
o introducing and refining our first e commerce solution in order to facilitate business opportunities and reduce transactional costs 
o significantly improving operational efficiencies through implementation of ideas generated by the operational analysis done with the assistance of vici capital 
these ideas include lowering manufacturing and transactional costs  automating processes  redefining policies and procedures and working to make every customer a profitable customer 
o strengthening pricing management and procurement methodologies 
o minimizing expense associated with the synergie product line until the economy improves and demand for capital equipment re emerges 
in the meantime seek additional independent distributors and strategic partnerships 
o focusing international sales efforts on identifying key distributors and strategic partners who could represent the product line  particularly in europe 
o continuing development of new  state of the art products  both high tech and commodity  in fiscal year  for both the rehabilitation and aesthetic markets 
o exploring strategic business alliances that will leverage and complement the company s competitive strengths  increase market reach and supplement capital resources
