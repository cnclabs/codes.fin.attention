item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of securities act of  as amended  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expected financial position  business and financing plans 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the headings disclosure statement and risk factors 
overview we are a global provider of information technology  or it  and business services and solutions with specialized expertise in software product engineering  system integration  application development and consulting  and software distribution 
we deliver our portfolio of services and solutions using a global delivery model combining offshore  near shore and local teams 
the primary industries  or verticals  we serve include high tech companies and independent software vendors  or isvs  utilities and government  financial services  defense and homeland security  and life sciences and healthcare 
we have operations in countries across north america  europe  israel and asia pacific 
we combine our deep vertical expertise and strong technical capabilities to provide a complete range of high quality services on a global scale 
by integrating our local and international personnel in focused business and project teams  we leverage our corporate knowledge and experience  intellectual property and global infrastructure to develop innovative solutions for clients across the geographies and verticals we serve 
through our global delivery model  which includes lower cost offshore and near shore delivery capabilities  we can achieve meaningful cost reductions or other benefits for our clients 
on october   we reorganized our operating segments to correspond to our three primary service lines software product engineering  system integration  application development and consulting  and software distribution 
our revenues increased to million for  from million for net income increased to million for  from million for net income in was helped by a gain from the sale of our israeli sap sales and distribution operations  representing million net of related expenses  net of taxes  and was hurt by a non cash write down in the asset value of our israeli severance pay fund  representing million  net of taxes 
net income in was negatively impacted by a one time arbitration settlement  representing million  including related and other expenses  net of taxes 
our revenue growth is attributable to a number of factors  including acquisitions we made  increases in the number and size of projects for existing clients  and the addition of new clients 
our client base is diverse  and we are not dependent on any single client 
in  no client accounted for more than of our revenues and our largest twenty clients together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
for  the percentage of our revenues derived in aggregate from agencies of the government of israel was 
existing clients from prior years generated more than of our revenues in 
table of contents our backlog as of december  was million compared to million as of december  this represents year over year backlog growth of million  offset by the divestiture of two business units in with their associated backlog  representing million  and a reduction in the dollar value of our non us backlog due to the strengthening dollar  representing million 
we achieve backlog through new signings of it services projects and outsourcing contracts  including for new and repeat customers 
we recognize backlog as revenue when we perform the services related to backlog 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  including approximately  it professionals 
of the  employees  approximately  were in india   were in israel   were in europe  were in north america and were in the asia pacific region 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and which could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from contracts for software product engineering  system integration  application development and consulting services  and sales of third party software licenses 
we provide services on either a fixed price or time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as services are performed based on the hours actually incurred at the negotiated billing rates 
we also charge our clients for certain costs and expenses  such as the installation of hardware and cost of subcontractors 
our fixed price contracts relate primarily to long term development projects 
such projects that require significant customization  integration and installation are recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenues related to these contracts using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs expected upon completion 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the resources and time required to fulfill the contracts obligations including work effort and subcontractors 
we rely on our experience from other projects in making these estimates  and  in addition  use our internal project management and financial systems to track and manage the projects 
employees and project managers regularly submit updates to these systems  which are then used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
historically  our estimates have been indicative of our actual results  however  there have been a few cases where we had to adjust assumptions  primarily regarding work effort 
we generally recognize revenues on a gross basis  representing the entire amount  because we bear the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and have latitude in establishing product pricing above specific minimums 
management determines whether we bear the risks and rewards of ownership based on relevant sale contract terms 
whenever the majority of contract terms indicate that we bear the risks and rewards  revenues are recognized on a gross basis 
for most software license sales and hardware sales  we record revenues on a net basis  based on management s determination that majority of contract terms indicate that we do not bear the risks and rewards related to such contracts 
for arrangements that involve multiple revenue activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products and services  management allocates the associated consideration to the separate activities based on 
table of contents their relative fair values 
in order to determine the fair values of the different activities covered by each agreement  management applies standard pricing used for products and services in similar arrangements and hourly rates based on similar activities we have performed for other clients 
our revenue recognition approach for software licensing requires that  in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition as amended  four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the credit worthiness of each client based upon market capitalization and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in each financial period  we estimate the likelihood of collecting every receivable and record a cumulative allowance 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license and service sales  maintenance agreements  customer contracts and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and discount rate 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform tests for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that long lived assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
based on the impairment test performed as of december   no impairment was identified 
these forecasted undiscounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins  future economic and market conditions 
our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of december of each year  or more often if there are indicators of impairment present 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill at the level of the reporting units 
in the first step  or step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired  and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step  or step  of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
to determine the fair value used in step  we use discounted cash flows 
if and when we are required to perform a step analysis  determining the fair value of our net assets and our off balance sheet intangibles would require us to make judgments that involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we performed our annual impairment test as of december  and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach  which utilizes a discounted cash flow model  as we believe that this approach best approximates our fair value at this time 
we have corroborated the fair values using the market approach 
judgments and assumptions related to revenue  gross profit  operating expenses  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital  interest  capital expenditures  cash flows  and market conditions are inherent in developing the discounted cash flow model 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill 
additionally  we evaluated the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units by reconciling to our market capitalization 
this reconciliation allowed us to consider market expectations in corroborating the reasonableness of the fair value of our reporting units 
in addition  we compared our market capitalization  including an estimated control premium that an investor would be willing to pay for a controlling interest in us  to the fair value of the company based on a third party valuation study 
the determination of a control premium requires the use of judgment and is based primarily on comparable industry and deal size transactions  related synergies and other benefits 
our market capitalization declined during the fourth quarter of  and subsequently  as a result of market driven declines in our stock trading price 
this decline is consistent with overall market conditions and is not a result of changes in our expectations of future cash flows 
our reconciliation of the gap between our market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of the company depends on various factors  some of which are qualitative and involve management judgment  including stable relatively high backlog coverage and experience in meeting operating cash flow targets 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization and expectations of future cash flows and will perform impairment testing if deemed necessary 
when we reorganize our operating segments to correspond to changes in our management structure  we reallocate our goodwill balance to the new reportable segments based on their relative fair values 
this process  which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  is subjective and involves management judgment and related assumptions 
tax accounting we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
effective january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 

table of contents we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations 
our effective tax rate was  and for  and our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
legal contingencies we are the defendants in various lawsuits  including employment claims and other legal proceedings in the normal course of our business 
in determining whether provisions should be recorded for pending litigation claims  we assess the allegations made and the likelihood that we will successfully defend ourselves 
when we believe that it is probable that we will not prevail in a particular matter  we then estimate the amount of the provision required based in part on our legal counsels advice

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer  who evaluates our performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit 
in october  we reorganized our operating segments to correspond to our three primary service lines  in line with changes made in the company s management structure 
segment data for prior periods has been restated to reflect the current organization of the segments 
our operating segments are software product engineering  in which  through our software product labs business unit  we offer software product research and development services 
we set up these labs for clients and operate them on an ongoing basis  enabling us to collaborate with our clients engineering teams to 
table of contents extend their capacity and budgets throughout the software product life cycle 
we locate our software product labs predominantly in india and in central and eastern europe and we operate them across multiple locations as needed to optimize global delivery 
they serve primarily customers in north america and europe  and may include team members local to the client 
system integration and application development  in which we offer a broad set of it services to our clients in the area of system integration  application development and consulting 
we provide these services in countries throughout north america  europe  israel and asia pacific 
we deliver the services through a global delivery model that includes local teams as well as offshore and near shore resources 
we provide these services for a wide range of clients in many verticals  including utilities and government  financial services  defense and homeland security  life sciences healthcare  manufacturing and transportation  retail  and others 
software distribution  in which  through our nesspro business unit  we market and sell enterprise software licenses of third party software vendors to corporate clients in geographies which are partially or totally uncovered by the software vendors own sales forces 
we also provide a range of implementation  customization and support services related to those licenses 
we resell products mostly in israel  italy  spain and portugal for over third party software vendors 
segment operating profit is defined as income from operations excluding unallocated headquarters costs 
expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling  general  administrative and delivery costs 
certain general and administrative expenses  stock based compensation and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management believes they are not directly attributable to any specific segment 
accordingly  these expenses are categorized as unallocated expenses and adjusted against our total income from operations 
additionally  our management has determined that it is not practical to allocate certain identifiable assets by segment  when such assets are used interchangeably among the segments
