management summary the company s management has believed for some time that  due to significant differences in operating strategy between the company s fiber optics and photovoltaics businesses  they would provide greater value to shareholders if they were operated as two separate business entities 
over the past two years  the company has completed several acquisitions to strengthen one or both of these businesses with a view toward their eventual separation 
on april   the company announced that its board of directors had formally authorized management to prepare a comprehensive operational and strategic plan for the separation of these businesses into separate corporations 
management began assessing alternative methods for achieving this goal  however  the subsequent onset of the recent worldwide economic and financial crisis has had a significant adverse impact on these plans 
a dramatic reduction in customer demand for many of the company s fiber optics products through june has significantly lowered revenue and cash flow in that business unit  while a shortage of debt and equity capital  a decline in the price of conventional energy sources  and a generally cautious and conservative attitude in all business sectors has delayed the opportunities for expanded deployment of the company s terrestrial photovoltaic products and systems 
as a result  while the company is continuing to pursue strategic alternatives for separating its two operating segments  the company has also instituted a series of initiatives aimed at conserving and generating cash over the next twelve months 
during fiscal  management implemented a series of measures and continues to evaluate opportunities intended to align the company s cost structure with its revenue forecasts 
such measures included establishing a line of credit with bank of america  several workforce reductions  salary reductions  the elimination of executive and employee merit increases  and the elimination or reduction of certain discretionary expenses 
the company has also significantly lowered its spending on capital expenditures and focused on improving the management of its working capital 
during fiscal  the company monetized approximately million of inventory  generated million in cash from lowering its accounts receivable balances and achieved positive cash flow from operations during the quarters ended june  and september  in fiscal  the company will continue to remain focused on cash flow while accessing a range of strategic options for the purpose of maximizing shareholder value  including joint venture business opportunities and the potential sale of certain assets 
with respect to measures taken to generate cash  the company sold its minority ownership positions in entech solar  inc and lightron corporation in the second quarter of fiscal in april  the company amended the terms of its asset backed revolving credit facility with bank of america which reduced the total loan availability to million but also generally resulted in higher borrowing capacity against any given schedule of accounts receivable 
on october   the company entered into an equity line of credit arrangement with commerce court small cap value fund  ltd 
commerce court 
upon issuance of a draw down request by the company  commerce court has committed to purchasing up to million worth of shares of the company s common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement  provided that the number of shares the company may sell under the facility is limited to no more than  shares of common stock or that would result in the beneficial ownership of more than of the then issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
the accounting estimates that require our most significant  difficult  and subjective judgments include the valuation of inventory  goodwill  intangible assets  and stock based compensation  assessment of recovery of long lived assets  revenue recognition associated with the percentage of completion method  and the allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty accruals 
management develops estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available 
the company s reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to significant accounting policies 
in the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
a listing and description of the company s critical accounting policies includes accounts receivable 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable and accordingly maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
the allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk of collection 
the company classifies charges associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts as sg a expense 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  impacting their ability to pay us  additional allowances may be required 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded million in bad debt expense  of which million related to the fiber optics segment and million related to the photovoltaics segment  primarily related to receivables from the sale of terrestrial solar power products 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the standard cost method 
the company reserves against inventory once it has been determined that conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose or the inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete based on the company s forecasted future revenue 
the charge related to inventory reserves is recorded as a cost of revenue 
the majority of the inventory write downs are related to estimated allowances for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value and on excess raw material components resulting from finished product obsolescence 
in most cases where the company sells previously written down inventory  it is typically sold as a component part of a finished product 
the finished product is sold at market price at the time resulting in higher average gross margin on such revenue 
the company does not track the selling price of individual raw material components that have been previously written down or written off  since such raw material components usually are only a portion of the resultant finished products and related sales price 
the company evaluates inventory levels at least quarterly against sales forecasts on a significant part by part basis  in addition to determining its overall inventory risk 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur charges to write down our inventory 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded million in inventory write downs  of which million related to the fiber optics segment and million related to the photovoltaics segment 
the significant portion of the inventory write downs in fiscal was related to inventory acquired from the acquisition of intel corporation s optical platform division 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
management has elected december st as the annual assessment date 
circumstances that could trigger an interim impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the market value of the company s common stock  the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed  results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 

table of contents in performing goodwill impairment testing  the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighted combination of a market based approach and a discounted cash flow dcf approach 
the market based approach relies on values based on market multiples derived from comparable public companies 
in applying the dcf approach  management forecasts cash flows over the remaining useful life of its primary asset using assumptions of current economic conditions and future expectations of earnings 
this analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment  including judgments about appropriate discount rates based on the assessment of risks inherent in the amount and timing of projected future cash flows 
the derived discount rate may fluctuate from period to period as it is based on external market conditions 
all of these assumptions are critical to the estimate and can change from period to period 
updates to these assumptions in future periods  particularly changes in discount rates  could result in different results of goodwill impairment tests 
as disclosed in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   as a result of the unfavorable macroeconomic environment and a significant reduction in our market capitalization since the completion of the asset acquisitions from intel corporation the intel acquisitions  the company reduced its internal revenue and profitability forecasts and revised its operating plans to reflect a general decline in demand and average selling prices  especially for the company s recently acquired telecom related fiber optics component products 
the company also performed an interim test as of september  to determine whether there was impairment of its goodwill 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was determined by using a weighted average of the guideline public company  guideline merged and acquired company  and the dcf methods 
due to uncertainty in the company s business outlook arising from the ongoing financial liquidity crisis and the current economic recession  management believed the most appropriate approach would be an equally weighted approach  amongst the three methods  to arrive at an indicated value for each of the reporting units 
the indicated fair value of each of the reporting units was then compared with the reporting unit s carrying value to determine whether there was an indication of impairment of goodwill under asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
as a result  the company determined that the goodwill related to one of its fiber optics reporting units may be impaired 
since the second step of the company s goodwill impairment test was not completed before the fiscal year end financial statements were issued and a goodwill impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  management recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  as a best estimate  during the three months ended september  during the three months ended december   there was further deterioration of the company s market capitalization  significant adverse changes in the business climate primarily related to product pricing and profit margins  and an increase in the discount rate 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and management weighted the market based approach heavier than the dcf method using information that was available at the time 
based on this analysis  the company determined that goodwill related to its fiber optics reporting units was fully impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million and the company s balance sheet no longer reflects any goodwill associated with its fiber optics reporting units 
the company s annual impairment test as of december   indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill for the photovoltaics reporting unit 
based upon revised operational and cash flow forecasts  the photovoltaics reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value 
as of september   the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test on its remaining goodwill based on revised operational and cash flow forecasts 
the impairment testing indicated that no impairment existed and that fair value exceeded carrying value by approximately 
the company continues to report goodwill related to its photovoltaics reporting unit and the company believes the remaining carrying amount of goodwill as of september  is not impaired 
however  if there is further erosion of the company s market capitalization or the photovoltaics reporting unit is unable to achieve its projected cash flows  management may be required to perform additional impairment tests of its remaining goodwill 
the outcome of these additional tests may result in the company recording additional goodwill impairment charges 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets 
because most of the company s long lived assets are subject to amortization  the company reviews these assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of asc  property  plant  and equipment 
as part of internal control procedures  the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our impairment testing of long lived assets consists of determining whether the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group is recoverable  in other words  whether the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset asset group exceeds its carrying amount 
the determination of the existence of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows related to an asset or group of assets 
in making this determination  the company uses certain assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  the length of service that assets will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
as disclosed in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   as a result of reductions to our internal revenue and profitability forecasts  changes to our internal operating forecasts and a significant reduction in our market capitalization since the completion of the intel acquisitions  the company tested for impairment of its long lived assets and other intangible assets 
the sum of future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value for each of the reporting units long lived and other intangible assets 
accordingly  no impairment existed under asc  property  plant  and equipment as of september  as the long lived asset asset group met the recoverability test  no further testing was required or performed 
during the three months ended december   the company recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling million related to certain intangible assets that were acquired from the intel acquisitions that were subsequently abandoned 
as of december   due to further changes in estimates of future operating performance and cash flows that occurred during the quarter  the company tested for impairment of its long lived assets and other intangible assets and based on that analysis  determined that no impairment existed 
as of june   the company performed an evaluation of its fiber optics segment asset group for impairment 
the impairment test was triggered by a determination that it was more likely than not those certain assets would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
as a result of the evaluation  it was determined that an impairment existed  and a charge of million was recorded to write down the long lived assets to an estimated value  which was determined based on a combination of guideline public company comparisons and future undiscounted cash flows 
of the total impairment charge  million related to plant and equipment and million related to intangible assets 
the current adverse economic conditions had a significant negative effect on the company s assessment of the value of the fiber optics segment asset group 
the impairment charge primarily resulted from the combined effect of the current slowdown in product orders and lower pricing exacerbated by currently high discount rates used in estimating values and the effects of recent declines in market values of debt and equity securities of comparable public companies 
this impairment charge in combination with other non cash charges will not cause the company to be in default under any of its financial covenants associated with its credit facility nor will it have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity position or cash flows 
the determination of enterprise value involved a number of assumptions and estimates 
the company uses a combination of two value inputs to estimate enterprise value of its reporting units internal future undiscounted cash flow analyses income approach and comparable company equity values 
recent pending and or completed relevant transactions method was not used due to lack of recent transactions 
the income approach involved estimates of future performance that reflected assumptions regarding  among other things  sales volumes and expected margins 
another key variable in the income approach was the discount rate  or weighted average cost of capital 
the determination of the discount rate takes into consideration the capital structure  debt ratings and current debt yields of comparable companies as well as an estimate of return on equity that reflects historical market returns and current market volatility for the industry 
enterprise value estimates based on comparable company equity values involve using trading multiples of revenue of those selected companies to derive appropriate multiples to apply to the revenue of the reporting units 
this approach requires an estimate  using historical acquisition data  of an appropriate control premium to apply to the reporting unit values calculated from such multiples 
critical judgments include the selection of comparable companies and the weighting of the two value inputs in developing the best estimate of enterprise value 

table of contents as of september   the company performed impairment tests on its long lived assets for its asset groups based on revised operational and cash flow forecasts 
the impairment testing indicated that no impairment existed and that future undiscounted cash flows exceeded carrying value by over for each of the company s asset groups 
the company believes the carrying amount of its long lived assets and intangible assets as of september  are recoverable 
however  if there is further erosion of the company s market capitalization or the company is unable to achieve its projected cash flows  management may be required to perform additional impairment tests of its remaining long lived assets and intangible assets 
the outcome of these additional tests may result in the company recording additional impairment charges 
product warranty reserves 
the company provides its customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and warranty claims for certain products 
in accordance with asc  contingencies  the company makes estimates of product warranty expense using historical experience rates as a percentage of revenue and accrues estimated warranty expense as a cost of revenue 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product issues 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded million in product warranty reserves in its photovoltaics segment that was primarily related to older generation cpv related product launches 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided persuasive evidence of a contract exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from a customer  the price is fixed  the product meets its specifications  title and ownership have transferred to the customer  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
in those few instances where a given sale involves post shipment obligations  formal customer acceptance documents  or subjective rights of return  revenue is not recognized until all post shipment conditions have been satisfied and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
the majority of our products have shipping terms that are free on board fob or free carrier alongside fca shipping point  which means that the company fulfills its delivery obligation when the goods are handed over to the freight carrier at our shipping dock 
this means the buyer bears all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods from that point 
in certain cases  the company ships its products cost insurance and freight cif 
under this arrangement  revenue is recognized under fca shipping point terms  but the company pays and bills the customer for the cost of shipping and insurance to the customer s designated location 
the company accounts for shipping and related transportation costs by recording the charges that are invoiced to customers as revenue  with the corresponding cost recorded as cost of revenue 
in those instances where inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized only when our customer pulls product for its use and title and ownership have transferred to the customer 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
the company also generates service revenue from hardware repairs and calibrations that is recognized as revenue upon completion of the service 
any cost of warranties and remaining obligations that are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized 
distributors the company uses a number of distributors around the world and recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to these distributors 
title and risk of loss pass to the distributors upon shipment  and our distributors are contractually obligated to pay the company on standard commercial terms  just like our other direct customers 
the company does not sell to its distributors on consignment and  except in the event of product discontinuance  does not give distributors a right of return 
solar panel and solar power systems contracts the company records revenues from certain solar panel and solar power systems contracts using the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recognized in proportion to actual costs incurred compared to total anticipated costs expected to be incurred for each contract 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
the company uses all available information in determining dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues  and contract costs 
estimates are revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made for the total loss anticipated 
as of september  and  the company had accrued million and million  respectively  related to estimated contract losses on certain cpv system related orders 
unbilled accounts receivable represents revenue recognized but not yet billed pursuant to contract terms or accounts billed after the period end 
as of september  and  unbilled accounts receivable totaled million and million  respectively 

table of contents government r d contracts r d contract revenue represents reimbursement by various us government entities  or their contractors  to aid in the development of new technology 
the applicable contracts generally provide that the company may elect to retain ownership of inventions made in performing the work  subject to a non exclusive license retained by the us government to practice the inventions for governmental purposes 
the r d contract funding may be based on a cost plus  cost reimbursement  or a firm fixed price arrangement 
the amount of funding under each r d contract is determined based on cost estimates that include both direct and indirect costs 
cost plus funding is determined based on actual costs plus a set margin 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record revenue 
contract costs include material  labor  special tooling and test equipment  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
an r d contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred  milestones have been reached  and any reporting obligations to the customer have been met 
government contract revenue is primarily recognized as service revenue 
the company also has certain cost sharing r d arrangements 
under such arrangements in which the actual costs of performance are split between the us government and the company on a best efforts basis  no revenue is recorded and the company s r d expense is reduced for the amount of the cost sharing receipts 
the us government may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements 
if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience  we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs 
if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default  generally the us government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract items  net of the work accepted from the original contract 
the us government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default 
stock based compensation 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model and the straight line attribution approach to determine the fair value of stock based awards in accordance with asc  compensation 
the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the company s expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock based awards 
the expected stock price volatility is based on the company s historical stock prices

order backlog is defined as purchase orders or supply agreements accepted by the company with expected product delivery and or services to be performed within the next twelve months 
from time to time  our customers may request that we delay shipment of certain orders and our backlog could also be adversely affected if customers unexpectedly cancel purchase orders that we ve previously accepted 
a majority of our fiber optics products typically ship within the same quarter as when the purchase order is received  therefore  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period

on a segment basis  annual revenue for the fiber optics segment was million  a decrease of million  or  from million reported in the same period last year 
the decrease in fiber optics revenue was primarily due to a significant drop in demand from our customers due to the very unfavorable macroeconomic environment as well as continued pressure on selling prices as we compete to maintain or increase our market share positions 
for the fiscal year  the fiber optics segment represented of the company s consolidated revenue compared to in the same period last year 
annual revenue for the photovoltaics segment was million  a decrease of million  or  from million reported in the same period last year

for the fiscal year  the consolidated gross margin was negative compared to a positive gross margin reported in the same period last year 

table of contents fiber optics gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  was negative  a decrease from a gross margin reported in the same period last year 
the decrease in fiber optics gross margin was primarily due to losses recorded on firm inventory purchase commitments  unabsorbed overhead expenses due to declining revenues  and inventory valuation write downs 
in addition  the decrease was also caused by the company s efforts to monetize older generation product inventory as it transitions to newer lower cost and more competitive design platforms 
photovoltaics gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  was  an increase from a negative gross margin reported in the same period last year 
the significant increase in photovoltaics gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin satellite solar power products along with improved manufacturing yields on certain satellite solar panel contracts 
operating expenses sales  general  and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  totaled million  a million increase from million reported in the same period last year 
the overall increase of sg a expenses was primarily due to legal and consulting expenses and an increase in reserves for bad debts 
the company recorded million in bad debt expense  of which million related to the fiber optics segment and million related to the photovoltaics segment  primarily related to receivables from the sale of terrestrial solar power products 
the allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk of collection 
during the fiscal year  management implemented a series of measures intended to realign the company s cost structure with lower revenues including several reductions in workforce  the furloughing of employees  salary reductions  the elimination of executive and employee merit increases  and the reduction or elimination of certain discretionary expenses

as a result  the company recorded an estimated impairment charge of million during the quarter ended september  as disclosed in the first fiscal quarter of  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and  based on that analysis  determined that goodwill related to its fiber optics segment was fully impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal and the company s balance sheet no longer reflects any goodwill associated with its fiber optics segment 
during the first fiscal quarter  the company also recorded a million non cash impairment charge related to certain intangible assets acquired from intel corporation that were subsequently abandoned 
as of june   the company performed an evaluation of its fiber optics segment asset group for impairment 
the impairment test was triggered by a determination that it was more likely than not those certain assets would be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of their previously estimated useful lives

in november  the company announced that it was suspending its reliance on previously issued financial statements  which in turn caused the company s form s registration statements for shares of common stock issuable under the option plans not to be available 
therefore  employees and terminated employees were precluded from exercising stock options until the company became compliant with its sec filings and the registration of the stock option shares was once again effective the blackout period 
in april  the company s board of directors approved a stock option grant modification for terminated employees by extending the normal day exercise period after date of termination to a date after which the blackout period was lifted 
the company communicated the terms of the stock option grant modification with its terminated employees in november the company s board of directors approved an extension of the stock option expiration date equal to the number of calendar days during the blackout period before such stock option would have otherwise expired the tolling period 
terminated employees were able to exercise their vested stock options beginning on the first day after the lifting of the blackout period for a period equal to the tolling period 
approximately terminated employees were impacted by this modification 
all tolled stock options were either exercised or expired by january  to account for a stock option grant modification  when the rights conveyed by a stock based compensation award are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee  the award ceases to be accounted for under asc  compensation  and becomes subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of asc  derivatives and hedging  which results in liability classification and measurement of the award 
on the date of modification  stock options that receive extended exercise terms are initially measured at fair value and expensed as if the stock options awards were new grants 
subsequent changes in fair value are reported in earnings and disclosed in the financial statements as long as the stock options remain classified as liabilities 
during the three months ended december   the company incurred a non cash expense of million associated with the modification of stock options issued to terminated employees which was calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
the modified stock options were vested at the time of grant with an estimated life of no greater than days 
when the stock options classified as liabilities were ultimately settled in stock  any gains or losses on those stock options were included in additional paid in capital 
for unexercised stock options that ultimately expired in january  the liability was relieved with a gain of million recorded in current earnings 
since these modified stock options were issued to terminated employees of the company  and therefore no services were required to receive this grant and no contractual obligation existed at the company to issue these modified stock options  the company concluded it was more appropriate to classify this non cash expense within other income and expense in the company s statement of operations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended september   which included a non cash impairment charge of million related to the write down of fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets associated with the company s fiber optics segment 
the company s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the company will be able to reduce or eliminate its net losses for the foreseeable future 
although total revenue had increased sequentially over the past several years prior to  the company has not been able to sustain historical revenue growth rates due to material adverse changes in market and economic conditions 
if management is not able to increase revenue and or manage operating expenses in line with revenue forecasts  the company may not be able to achieve profitability 
as of september   cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and restricted cash totaled approximately million 
historically  the company has consumed cash from operations 
during fiscal  we consumed cash from operations of approximately million  with the rate of cash consumption declining each quarter 
management actions and plans historically  management has addressed liquidity requirements through a series of cost reduction initiatives  capital markets transactions and the sale of assets 
management anticipates that the current recession in the united states and internationally may continue to impose formidable challenges for the company s businesses in the near term 
the company s management has believed for some time that  due to significant differences in operating strategy between the company s fiber optics and photovoltaics businesses  they would provide greater value to shareholders if they were operated as two separate business entities 
over the past two years  the company has completed several acquisitions to strengthen one or both of these businesses with a view toward their eventual separation 
on april   the company announced that its board of directors had formally authorized management to prepare a comprehensive operational and strategic plan for the separation of these businesses into separate corporations 
management began assessing alternative methods for achieving this goal  however  the subsequent onset of the recent worldwide economic and financial crisis has had a significant adverse impact on these plans 
a dramatic reduction in customer demand for many of the company s fiber optics products through june has significantly lowered revenue and cash flow in that business unit  while a shortage of debt and equity capital  a decline in the price of conventional energy sources  and a generally cautious and conservative attitude in all business sectors has delayed the opportunities for expanded deployment of the company s terrestrial photovoltaic products and systems 
as a result  while the company is continuing to pursue strategic alternatives for separating its two operating segments  the company has also instituted a series of initiatives aimed at conserving and generating cash over the next twelve months 
during fiscal  management implemented a series of measures and continues to evaluate opportunities intended to align the company s cost structure with its revenue forecasts 
such measures included establishing a line of credit with bank of america  several workforce reductions  salary reductions  the elimination of executive and employee merit increases  and the elimination or reduction of certain discretionary expenses 
the company has also significantly lowered its spending on capital expenditures and focused on improving the management of its working capital 
during fiscal  the company monetized approximately million of inventory  generated million in cash from lowering its accounts receivable balances and achieved positive cash flow from operations during the quarters ended june  and september  in fiscal  the company will continue to remain focused on cash flow while accessing a range of strategic options for the purpose of maximizing shareholder value  including joint venture business opportunities and the potential sale of certain assets 
with respect to measures taken to generate cash  the company sold its minority ownership positions in entech solar  inc and lightron corporation in the second quarter of fiscal in april  the company amended the terms of its asset backed revolving credit facility with bank of america which reduced the total loan availability to million but also generally resulted in higher borrowing capacity against any given schedule of accounts receivable 
on october   the company entered into an equity line of credit arrangement with commerce court small cap value fund  ltd 
commerce court 
upon issuance of a draw down request by the company  commerce court has committed to purchasing up to million worth of shares of the company s common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement  provided that the number of shares the company may sell under the facility is limited to no more than  shares of common stock or that would result in the beneficial ownership of more than of the then issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock 

table of contents conclusion we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities  together with the cash expected to be generated from operations  amounts expected to be available under our revolving credit facility with bank of america and the equity line of credit agreement with commerce court will provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our cash requirements for operations  working capital  and capital expenditures for the next months 
however  in the event of unforeseen circumstances  or unfavorable market or economic developments  we may have to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity  debt or convertible debt  or selling certain product lines and or portions of our business 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
a significant contraction in the capital markets  particularly in the technology sector  may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital if or when it is required  especially if we experience disappointing operating results 
if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
currency exchange rates 
the united states dollar is the functional currency for the company s consolidated financials 
the functional currency of the company s spanish subsidiary is the euro and for the china subsidiary it is the yuan renminbi 
the financial statements of these entities are translated to united states dollars using period end rates for assets and liabilities  and the weighted average rate for the period for all revenue and expenses 
during the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 
to reduce the impact of these risks on the company s earnings and to increase the predictability of cash flows  the company uses natural offsets in receipts and disbursements within the applicable currency as the primary means of reducing the risk 
some of our foreign suppliers may adjust their prices in us from time to time to reflect currency exchange fluctuations  and such price changes could impact our future financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not currently hedge its foreign currency exposure 
credit market conditions recently  the us and global capital markets have been experiencing turbulent conditions  particularly in the credit markets  as evidenced by tightening of lending standards  reduced availability of credit  and reductions in certain asset values 
this could impact the company s ability to obtain additional funding through financing or asset sales
