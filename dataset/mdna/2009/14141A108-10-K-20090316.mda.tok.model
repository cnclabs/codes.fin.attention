table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies to prepare financial statements that conform with us generally accepted accounting principles  we must select and apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions of our medical treadmill product line  burdick and csi 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  for each reporting unit identified for purposes of accounting for goodwill 
a reporting unit represents a portion of our business for which we regularly review certain discrete financial information and operational results 
the company has determined that it has one reporting unit  consisting of general cardiology products  which also includes the product service business 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  and potentially result in recognition of an impairment of goodwill  which would be reflected as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment at november  in accordance with our policy for performing this test annually 
we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million  equivalent to the full amount of previously acquired goodwill  during the fourth quarter of see note goodwill to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion of the impairment charge 
deferred tax assets and income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to account for our income taxes 
this process involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income 
if required  we will recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
factors we consider in making such an assessment include  but are not limited to past performance  including our recent history of operating results on a gaap basis  our recent history of generating taxable income  our history of recovering net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes and our expectation of future taxable income  both considering our past history in predicting future results and considering current macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry 
stock based compensation 
as of january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based 
table of contents payment sfas r  and applied the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating future volatility  expected term and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of trade names  developed technology  patent rights and customer relationships  all of which were acquired in our acquisition of burdick in  the merger transaction with csi in and the cross licensing agreement with koninklijke philips electronics nv philips in we use our judgment to estimate the fair value of each of these intangible assets 
our judgment about fair value is based on our expectation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we also use our judgment to estimate the useful lives of each intangible asset 
we believe the burdick and cardiac science trade names have indefinite lives and  accordingly  we do not amortize the trade names 
we evaluate this conclusion annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired and make a judgment about whether there are factors that would limit our ability to benefit from the trade name in the future 
if there were such factors  we would start amortizing the trade name over the expected remaining period in which we believed it would continue to provide benefit 
with respect to our developed technology  customer relationship and patent rights  we also evaluate the remaining useful lives annually 
we periodically evaluate whether our intangible assets are impaired 
for our trade names  this evaluation is performed annually  or more frequently if events occur that suggest there may be an impairment loss  and involves comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of fair value 
for intangible assets related to developed technology  customer relationship and patent rights  this evaluation would be performed if events occur that suggest there may be an impairment loss 
if we conclude that any of our intangible assets are impaired  we would record a loss on our statement of operations and reduce the value of the intangible asset 
we performed a test for impairment of our indefinite lived intangibles as of november  we did not record an impairment charge as a result of the analysis 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our assets 
we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
we analyze historical write offs  changes in our internal credit policies and customer concentrations when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
different estimates regarding the collectability of accounts receivable may have a material impact on the timing and amount of reported bad debt expense and on the carrying value of accounts receivable 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  such as machinery and equipment  and intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized on our statement of operations and as a reduction to value of the asset group on our balance sheet 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
inventories 
inventories represent a significant portion of our assets 
we value inventories at the lower of cost  on an average cost basis  or market 
we regularly perform a detailed analysis of our inventories to determine whether adjustments are necessary to reduce inventory values to estimated net realizable value 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including the salability of individual items or classes of items  recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
different estimates regarding the net realizable value of inventories could have a material impact on our 
table of contents reported net inventory and cost of sales  and thus could have a material impact on the financial statements as a whole 
warranty 
we provide warranty service covering many of the products and systems we sell 
we estimate and accrue for future costs of providing warranty service  which relate principally to the hardware components of the systems  when the systems are sold 
our estimates are based  in part  on our warranty claims history and our cost to perform warranty service 
differences could result in the amount of the recorded warranty liability and cost of sales if we made different judgments or used different estimates 
software revenue recognition 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers may receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements on a when and if available basis  the fair value of which is recognized over the service period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement and the ability to identify vsoe of fair value for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
with respect to arrangements where software is considered more than incidental to the product  the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for undelivered support is deferred and the residual fair value of delivered software is recognized 
revenue from software implementation services is recognized as the services are provided based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
when significant implementation activities are required  we recognize revenue from software and services upon installation 
we occasionally sell software and hardware upgrades on a stand alone basis 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of hardware products is generally recognized when title transfers to the customer  typically upon shipment 
some of our customers are distributors that sell goods to third party end users 
except for certain identified distributors where collection may be contingent on distributor resale  we recognize revenue on sales of products made to distributors when title transfers to the distributor and all significant obligations have been satisfied 
in making a determination of whether significant obligations have been met  we evaluate any installation or integration obligations to determine whether those obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory 
in cases where the remaining installation or integration obligation is not determined to be inconsequential or perfunctory  we defer the portion of revenue associated with the fair value of the installation and integration obligation until these services have been completed 
distributors do not have price protection and generally do not have product return rights  except if the product is defective upon shipment or shipped in error  and in some cases upon termination of the distributor agreement 
for certain identified distributors where collection may be contingent on the distributor s resale  revenue recognition is deferred and recognized on a sell through or cash basis 
the determination of whether sales to distributors are contingent on resale is subjective because we must assess the financial wherewithal of the distributor to pay regardless of resale 
for sales to distributors  we consider several factors  including past payment history  where available  trade references  bank account balances  dun bradstreet reports and any other financial information provided by the distributor  in assessing whether the distributor has the financial wherewithal to pay regardless of  or prior to  resale of the product and that collection of the receivable is not contingent on resale 
we offer limited volume price discounts and rebates to certain distributors 
volume price discounts are on a per order basis based on the size of the order and are netted against the revenue recorded at the time of shipment 
we have some arrangements that provide for volume discounts based on meeting certain quarterly or annual purchase levels 
rebates are paid quarterly or annually and are accrued for as incurred 
we consider program management packages and training and other services as separate units of accounting and apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue no 
 
table of contents revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf when sold with an aed based on the fact that the items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and could be acquired from another vendor 
fair value is determined to be the price at which they are sold to customers on a stand alone basis 
training revenue is deferred and recognized at the time the training occurs 
aed program management services revenue  pursuant to agreements that exist with some customers pursuant to annual or multi year terms  are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the related contract period 
we offer optional extended service contracts to customers 
fair value is determined to be the price at which they are sold to customers on a stand alone basis 
service contract revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the extended service contracts  which generally begin after the expiration of the original warranty period 
for services performed  other than pursuant to warranty and extended service contract obligations  revenue is recognized when the service is performed and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas  which amends the factors that should be considered in renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement also establishes disclosure requirements designed to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
the requirements of fsp fas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the impact fsp fas will have on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption 
in march of  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement sfas 
sfas requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why the entity uses derivative instruments  how the instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement  and how the instruments and related hedged items affect the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the entity 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  but will require additional disclosure requirements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree  including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas r also requires an acquirer to record an adjustment to income tax expense for changes in valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions related to the acquired businesses 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for periods beginning after december  we are required to and plan to adopt the provisions of sfas r beginning in the first quarter of the impact of adopting sfas r will depend upon acquisitions  if any  we consummate after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb sfas  which will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of shareholders equity within the consolidated balance sheets 
the requirements of sfas are effective for periods beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement fsp fas  which allows for the deferral of the adoption date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in 
table of contents the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we elected to defer the adoption of sfas for the assets and liabilities within the scope of fsp fas refer to note  fair value measurements  of this form k for our disclosures pursuant to the effective portion of sfas the adoption of sfas for those assets and liabilities within the scope of fsp fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
paragraph a of statement of financial accounting standard no  accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative  but is both a indexed our own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
eitf provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions  and thus able to qualify for the sfas paragraph a scope exception 
it also clarifies the impact of foreign currency denominated strike prices and market based employee stock option valuation instruments on the evaluation 
eitf will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after december   and early adoption is prohibited 
the impact of adopting eitf  if any  is not expected to be material 
results of operations overview of results during the year we posted record revenue of million  representing growth over expanded global aed distribution  particularly in europe and japan  and achieved significant market share increases introduced new and updated products  including a new cardiac rehabilitation system  increased connectivity options for stress systems and new non english language versions of a number of products achieved record operating cash flow were added to the russell index incurred a full pre tax write off of previously acquired goodwill totaling million  resulting primarily from the significant downturn in the global economy and related decreases in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of recorded a million charge related to the reorganization of our marketing and product development organizations  including a reduction in work force  in order to realign our cost structure  become more flexible and efficient in our operations  and operate profitably in a range of scenarios related to economic uncertainty in early  we announced an alliance with syncroness that will allow us to be quicker to market with product solutions that meet the needs of existing customers as well as broader markets we are addressing looking forward there are a number of factors that may negatively affect revenue growth in future periods  most notably the significant downturn in the global economy  in particular in the us and japan 
we continue to expect long term growth in aed revenues over time  both domestically and overseas 
however  we do not expect growth at the same level as recent years in the near term due to deteriorating global economic conditions which are having an impact on the speed of aed deployments domestically and internationally  including softness in the us and japanese markets  in particular 
in addition to weak economic conditions in japan  our operating performance in 
table of contents that market could be negatively impacted by our exclusive distributor s expected introduction of new products that may erode sales of our products in that market 
we believe the long term outlook for aed sales in the us and in japan is very positive 
however sales in the near term in both countries will likely be down in we believe our direct presence in several countries in europe will result in continued growth in sales in these markets over time  though again we may experience softness in the near term due to general economic factors 
although  we expect to continue to see meaningful revenue from the ge hospital defibrillator  we are cautious due to the economic environment creating challenges in the world wide hospital market 
we expect our cardiac monitoring line to ultimately grow over time though  again  due to the weak economy  our cardiac monitoring revenues may decline in we expect that service revenue and related gross profit will remain flat or grow somewhat in and will continue to grow thereafter 
additionally  ge s level of success in selling our new hospital defibrillator  the results of our continued effort to revitalize our cardiac monitoring line and our ability to continue to capture a sizeable share of the global aed market as it rapidly evolves will all be factors of our success going forward 
we expect continued growth in gross profit over the longer term 
however a number of the factors discussed above relating to revenue will negatively affect our gross profit in the near term 
operating expenses in included a pre tax charge million relating to the impairment of goodwill 
as all of our goodwill was written off in  we do not expect a similar charge in the foreseeable future 
we expect our operating expenses  other than the goodwill impairment charge  to decrease in the short term due to steps taken to realign our cost structure in which will enhance our ability to operate profitably under a range of scenarios during this period of increased economic uncertainty 
we expect operating expenses  other than the goodwill impairment charge  will increase over time if and when economic conditions improve and we resume revenue growth 
we are continuing to devote substantial resources to the continued development of new versions of our products to meet the changing requirements of our customers 
in addition  we intend to expand our sales and marketing activities over time  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase sales of our products and services 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will decrease in the near term in line with expected short term declines in revenue 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in the near term 
finally  we expect sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses to grow in the long run  as our revenues resume growth 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our non invasive cardiology products and related consumables  and to a lesser extent  from services related to these products  including training 
we categorize our revenues as defibrillation products  which include our aeds  hospital defibrillators and related accessories  cardiac monitoring products  which include capital equipment  software products and related accessories and supplies  and service  which includes service contracts  cpr aed training services  aed program management services  equipment maintenance and repair  replacement part sales and other services 
we derive a portion of our service revenue from sales of separate extended maintenance arrangements 
we defer and recognize these revenues over the applicable maintenance period

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  defibrillation products revenue increased significantly for from the comparable period in due to strong growth throughout europe and asia particularly in japan  which increased by during the period 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in domestic defibrillation products revenue of during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in this decrease was due in part to exceptionally high revenue in the prior year that included multi million dollar school and corporate aed deployments  which did not recur at the same levels in the weak us economy negatively impacted defibrillation product sales  especially in the latter part of cardiac monitoring products revenue decreased by for from the comparable period in we believe this is due  in part  to weakening of general economic conditions  resulting in longer buying cycles and deferred purchasing decisions for customers in this portion of our business 
service revenue increased for from the comparable period in due primarily to the success of our continued focus on  and promotion of  our aed training and program management services  and to a lesser extent on growth in our cardiac monitoring service contract sales 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  defibrillation products revenue increased significantly for from the comparable period in due to higher sales both internationally and domestically  as we continued to leverage our public access programs in various municipalities and schools  increase our national accounts sales  expand through distribution and take advantage of competitive opportunities in the market 
domestic defibrillation sales increased by and international sales grew by 
cardiac monitoring products revenue decreased by for from the comparable period in  although revenue for the three months ended december  increased by 
the decrease in our cardiac monitoring revenue was due primarily to increased competition in the us market for cardiology equipment and supplies 
service revenue decreased for from the comparable period in due primarily to the discontinuation in the second quarter of of certain non core service contracts acquired in the merger transaction with csi in and to a lesser degree to a reduction of product support in some areas  which was done in order to stimulate sales of new products 
gross profit gross profit is revenues less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with manufacturing  assembling and testing our products  amortization of certain intangibles  overhead costs  compensation  including stock based compensation and other costs related to manufacturing support and logistics 
we rely on third parties to manufacture certain of our product components 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to these manufacturers 
cost of service revenue consists of customer support costs  training and professional service expenses  parts and compensation 
our hardware products include a warranty period that includes factory repair services or replacement parts 
we accrue estimated expenses for warranty obligations at the time products are shipped

the slight increase in defibrillation products gross margin during was due efficiencies associated with increased volumes and a combination of favorable changes in product mix and cost reductions 
the decrease in cardiac monitoring products gross margin was due principally to changes in product mix 
gross profit from service increased as a percentage of service revenue for year ended december  from the comparable period in due in part to increased sales of higher value added offerings and general growth in service revenue while costs remained relatively fixed 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross profit from products increased for from the comparable period in due principally to a shift in overall product mix to a higher proportion of defibrillation products  for which gross margin is generally higher than for cardiac monitoring products  and from cost savings and productivity increases that resulted from planned improvements in our manufacturing processes 
gross profit from service decreased for from the comparable period in due principally to lower revenues on service contracts that were acquired in the merger transaction

accordingly  substantially all of our income tax expense is based on income excluding this impairment charge 
our worldwide effective tax rate applicable to income excluding the goodwill impairment charge was approximately 
this worldwide effective tax rate is down from our worldwide effective tax rate of due in part to a shift in income from the us to foreign jurisdictions with lower income tax rates  an increase in federal and state research and development credits as well as a slight decrease in our state effective tax rate 
the worldwide effective tax rate for was and resulted from our federal and state effective tax rates  partially offset by research and development credits earned during the same period
