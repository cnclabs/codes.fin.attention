we also have two repair and coating facilities located in texas 
our customers include railroads  leasing companies  and shippers of products  such as utilities  petrochemical companies  grain shippers  and major construction and industrial companies 
we compete against five major railcar manufacturers in the north american market 

table of contents for the year ended december   we shipped approximately  railcars  or approximately of total north american railcar shipments 
as of december   our rail group backlog was approximately million consisting of approximately  railcars 
the railcar backlog dollar value as of december  was as follows as of december  in millions external customers trip leasing leasing group total the total amount of the backlog dedicated to the leasing group was supported by lease agreements with external customers 
the final amount dedicated to the leasing group or trip rail leasing llc trip leasing may vary by the time of delivery 
we hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcars and components 
we believe patents offer a marketing advantage in certain circumstances 
no material revenues are received from licensing of these patents 
railcar leasing and management services group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  primarily tilc  we lease tank cars and freight cars 
our railcar leasing and management services group leasing group is a provider of leasing and management services and an important strategic resource that uniquely links our rail group with our customers 
trinity s rail group and tilc coordinate sales and marketing activities under the registered trade name trinityrail  thereby providing a single point of contact for railroads and shippers seeking solutions to their rail equipment and service needs 
the leasing group provides us with revenue  earnings  and cash flow diversification 
our railcars are leased to railroads  shippers  and various other companies that supply their own railcars to the railroads 
these companies span the petroleum  chemical  agricultural  and energy industries  among others 
substantially all of our owned railcars are purchased from and manufactured by our rail group at prices comparable to the prices for railcars sold by our rail group to third parties giving consideration for quantity  features  and production demands 
the terms of our railcar leases generally vary from one to twenty years and provide for fixed monthly rentals  with an additional mileage charge when usage exceeds a specified maximum 
a small percentage of our fleet is leased on a per diem basis 
as of december   our lease fleet included approximately  owned or leased railcars that were utilized 
of this total  approximately  railcars were owned by tilc and approximately  railcars were financed in sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  we manage railcar fleets on behalf of unaffiliated third parties 
we believe our railcar fleet management services complement our leasing business by generating stable fee income  strengthening customer relationships  and enhancing the view of trinity as a leading provider of railcar products and services 
our railcar leasing business competes against a number of well established entities that are also in the business of leasing railcars 
construction products group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  our construction products group produces concrete  aggregates  and asphalt and manufactures highway products as well as beams and girders used in highway bridge construction 
many of these lines of business are seasonal and revenues are impacted by weather conditions

our customers are located in close proximity to our asphalt plants 
in highway products  we are the only full line producer of guardrails  crash cushions  and other protective barriers that dissipate the force of impact in collisions between vehicles and fixed roadside objects 
based on revenues  we believe we are the largest highway guardrail manufacturer in the united states  with a comprehensive nationwide guardrail supply network 
the federal highway administration  which determines which products are eligible for federal funds for highway projects  has approved most of our products as acceptable permanent and construction zone highway hardware according to requirements of the national cooperative highway research program 
our crash cushions and other protective barriers include multiple proprietary products manufactured through various product license agreements with certain public and private research organizations and inventors 
we hold patents and are a licensee for certain of our guardrail and end treatment products that enhance our competitive position for these products 
we sell highway products in canada  mexico  and all of the united states 
we compete against several national and regional guardrail manufacturers 
we also export our proprietary highway products to certain other countries

our fiberglass reinforced lift covers are used primarily for grain barges while our rolling covers are used for other bulk commodities 
our four barge manufacturing facilities are located along the united states inland river systems allowing for rapid delivery to our customers 
our barge order backlog as of december  was approximately million 
our primary inland barge customers are commercial marine transportation companies 
many companies have the capability to enter into  and from time to time do enter into  the inland barge manufacturing business 
we strive to compete through operational efficiency and quality products 
energy equipment group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  our energy equipment group manufactures tank containers and tank heads for pressure vessels  propane tanks  and structural wind towers 
we are a leading manufacturer of tank containers and tank heads for pressure vessels 
we manufacture tanks in the united states and mexico 
we market a portion of our products in mexico under the brand name of tatsa 
we manufacture propane tanks that are used by industrial plants  utilities  residences  and small businesses in suburban and rural areas 
we also manufacture fertilizer containers for bulk storage  farm storage  and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia 
our propane tank products range from gallon tanks for motor fuel use to  gallon bulk storage spheres 
we sell our propane tanks to propane dealers and large industrial users 
in the united states we generally deliver the containers to our customers who install and fill the containers 
our competitors include large and small manufacturers of tanks 
we manufacture tank heads  which are pressed metal components used in the manufacturing of many of our finished products 
we manufacture the tank heads in various shapes  and we produce pressure rated or non pressure rated tank heads  depending on their intended use 
we use a significant portion of the tank heads we manufacture in the production of our tank cars and containers 
we also sell our tank heads to a broad range of other manufacturers 
there is strong competition in the tank heads business 
we are a leading manufacturer of structural wind towers in north america 
we manufacture structural wind towers for use in the wind energy market 
these towers are manufactured in the united states and mexico to 
table of contents customer specifications and installed by our customers 
our customers are generally turbine producers 
our structural wind towers order backlog as of december  was approximately billion 
there are a number of well established entities that actively compete with us in the business of manufacturing energy equipment 
all other 
all other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies  legal  environmental  and upkeep costs associated with non operating facilities  other peripheral businesses  and the change in market valuation related to ineffective commodity hedges 
foreign operations 
trinity s foreign operations are primarily located in mexico 
continuing operations included sales to foreign customers  primarily in mexico  which represented   and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december    and  we had approximately   and  respectively  of our long lived assets not held for sale located outside the united states 
we manufacture railcars  propane tank containers  tank heads  structural wind towers  and other parts at our mexico facilities for export to the united states and other countries 
any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and its agencies or on exports imposed by the government of mexico or its agencies could adversely affect our operations in mexico 
our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in foreign countries  including currency fluctuations  political changes  changes in laws and regulations  and economic instability 
although our operations have not been materially affected by any of these factors to date  any substantial disruption of business as it is currently conducted could adversely affect our operations at least in the short term 
backlog 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was approximately million  approximately million for inland barge products  and approximately billion for structural wind towers 
the railcar backlog as of december  and was as follows as of december  in millions external customers trip leasing leasing group total the total amount of the backlog dedicated to the leasing group was supported by lease agreements with external customers 
the majority of our backlog for railcars and barges is expected to be delivered in the months ending december  for multi year barge orders  the deliveries for are included in the backlog at this time  deliveries beyond are not included in the backlog if specific production quantities for future years have not been determined 
the backlog for structural wind towers is expected to be evenly delivered over the years ended december    and as of december   our backlog for new railcars was approximately billion  approximately million for inland barge products  and approximately million for structural wind towers 
included in the railcar backlog was approximately  million of railcars to be sold to our leasing group 
marketing 
we sell substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in multiple locations in the united states as well as canada  mexico  and sweden 
we also use independent sales representatives to a limited extent 
raw materials and suppliers 
railcar specialty components and steel 
products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel  as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  
table of contents wheels  axles  side frames  bolsters  and bearings 
specialty components and steel purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least two suppliers continue to produce most components 
however  any unanticipated interruption in the supply chain of specialty components would have an impact on both our margins and production schedules 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements 
however  market steel prices were extremely volatile and rose significantly during most of before eventually declining and leveling off at the end of the year 
we were able to mitigate the majority of this volatility through contract purchases and existing supplier commitments 
steel prices may continue to be volatile in part as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel production facilities and other market factors the prices for component parts purchased in also increased over the base prices we paid in we often use price escalation clauses and other arrangements with our customers to reduce the impact of these cost increases  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe the existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 
aggregates 
aggregates can be found throughout the united states  and many producers exist nationwide 
however  as a general rule  shipments from an individual quarry are limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself 
we operate mining facilities strategically located in texas  arkansas  and louisiana to fulfill some of our needs for aggregates 
cement 
cement required for the concrete and aggregates business is received primarily from texas and overseas 
in  the supply of cement was sufficient in our markets to meet demand 
we have not experienced difficulties supplying concrete to our customers 
employees 
the following table presents the approximate breakdown of employees by business group december  business group rail group construction products group inland barge group energy equipment group railcar leasing and management services group all other corporate as of december   approximately  employees were employed in the united states and approximately  employees were employed in mexico 
acquisitions and divestitures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport  and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  and other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts  but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental 
table of contents laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures  and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities  whether owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as changes in  or modified interpretations of  existing environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill  or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill  or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper  or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar  or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply 
governmental regulation 
railcar industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry are the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration and the federal railroad administration  both divisions of the united states department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars and railcar parts  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether any future changes in these rules and regulations could cause added compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
inland barge industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the united states coast guard  the united states national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents  and recommend safety standards 
violations of these laws and related regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
highway products 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of highway products business are the united states department of transportation  the federal highway administration  and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway products 
if our products were found not to be in compliance with these standards and specifications  we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 

table of contents we believe that our highway products are in substantial compliance with all applicable standards and specifications 
we cannot predict whether future changes in these standards and specifications would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
occupational safety and health administration and similar regulations 
our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and our operations may be adversely affected by the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
while we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
other matters 
to date  we have not suffered any material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to operate our various plant facilities or transportation vehicles 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles  could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

risk factors 
there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission sec  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements  and other written communications  as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the risks described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial but that which may become material in the future also may impair our business operations 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
accordingly  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein 
we undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
negative global economic conditions could continue to result in a decrease in our revenues and an increase in our operating costs  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
if the current global economic downturn continues  many of our customers may continue to delay or reduce their purchases of railcars  barges  and wind towers 
if the negative conditions in the global credit markets continue to prevent our customers access to credit  product orders may continue to decrease which could result in lower revenues 
likewise  if our suppliers continue to face challenges in obtaining credit  in selling their products  or otherwise in operating their businesses  they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products 
these actions could continue to result in reductions in our revenues  increased price competition  and increased operating costs  which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 
negative global economic conditions may lead to cancellations or delays in our backlog 
the continued lack of stability in the global economy  current conditions in the global credit markets  volatility in the ethanol industry  and or adverse changes in the financial condition of certain third party lessees could possibly lead to cancellations or delays of backlog orders 
the cyclical nature of our business results in lower revenues during economic downturns 
we operate in cyclical industries 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products 
decreased demand could result in lower sales volumes  lower prices  and or a loss of profits 
the railcar  barge  and wind energy industries have previously 
table of contents experienced deep down cycles and at such times operated with a minimal backlog 
if a down cycle were to continue or return in one or more of these cyclical businesses  we could experience losses and close plants  suspend production  and incur related costs 
the economic and financial crisis experienced by the united states economy during impacted our businesses 
steel costs were very volatile and rose significantly during most of the year before eventually declining and leveling off at the end of the year 
new orders for railcars and barges dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of as the transportation industry saw a significant decline in shipment of freight 
the outlook for the transportation industry for is for a significant downturn 
orders for structural wind towers dropped in the second half of the year as green energy companies experienced tightened credit markets coupled with lower prices for electricity sales 
the slow down in the residential and commercial construction markets impacted our construction products group as well 
we continually assess our manufacturing capacity and take steps to align our production facilities with the nature of the demand 
as a result of our assessment  we idled four railcar production facilities and one structural wind towers production facility during the fourth quarter of and early in litigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
we are currently  and may from time to time be  involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our operations 
adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims could result in significant monetary damages against us that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
while we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability and liability insurance at coverage levels based upon commercial norms in our industries  our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of claims or lawsuits or any future claims or lawsuits arising from our businesses for which we are judged liable 
any such claims or lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition 
increases in the price and demand for steel and other component parts could lower our margins and profitability 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements 
however  market steel prices were extremely volatile and rose significantly during most of before eventually declining and leveling off at the end of the year 
we were able to mitigate the majority of this volatility through contract purchases and existing supplier commitments 
steel prices may continue to be volatile in part as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel production facilities and other market factors 
the prices for component parts purchased in also increased over the base prices we paid in we often use price escalation clauses and other arrangements with our customers to reduce the impact of these cost increases  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe the existing contracts and other relationships we have developed will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 
we have potential exposure to environmental liabilities  which may increase costs and lower profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with air quality and the handling and disposal of waste products  fuel products  and hazardous substances 
in particular  we may incur investigation  remediation  and related expenses related to property conditions that we inherited after acquiring older manufacturing facilities that were constructed and operated before the adoption of current environmental laws 
further  some of the products we manufacture are used to transport hazardous materials 
although we conduct due diligence inquiries and analysis with respect to environmental matters in connection with acquisitions  we may be unable to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
environmental liabilities incurred by us  if not covered by adequate insurance or indemnification  will increase our respective costs and have a negative impact on our profitability 
we operate in highly competitive industries  which may impact our financial results 
we face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate 
as a result  competition on pricing is often intense 
the effect of this competition could reduce our revenues  limit our ability to grow  increase pricing pressure on our products  and otherwise affect our financial results 

table of contents if our railcar leasing subsidiary is unable to obtain acceptable long term financing of its railcar lease fleet  our lenders may foreclose on the portion of our lease fleet that secures our warehouse facility 
tilc  our wholly owned captive leasing subsidiary  uses borrowings under a warehouse facility to initially finance the railcars it purchases from our rail manufacturing business 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are secured by the specific railcars financed by such borrowings and the underlying leases 
the warehouse facility is non recourse to us and to our subsidiaries other than trinity rail leasing trust ii trl ii  a qualified subsidiary of tilc that is the borrower under the warehouse facility 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are available through august  and unless renewed would be payable in three equal installments in february  august  and february a decline in the value of the railcars securing borrowings under the warehouse facility or in the creditworthiness of the lessees under the associated leases could reduce trl ii s ability to obtain long term financing for such railcars 
additionally  fluctuations in interest rates from the time trl ii purchases railcars with short term borrowings under the warehouse facility and the time trl ii obtains permanent financing for such railcars could decrease our profitability on the leasing of the railcars and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if trl ii is unable to obtain long term financing to replace borrowings under the warehouse facility  trinity may decide to satisfy trl ii s indebtedness under the warehouse facility or the lenders under the warehouse facility may foreclose on the portion of trl ii s lease fleet pledged to secure this facility 
as of december   there was million of indebtedness outstanding and million was available under the warehouse facility 
we may be unable to re market leased railcars on favorable terms  which could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
the profitability of our railcar leasing business is dependent in part on our ability to re lease or sell railcars we own upon the expiration of existing lease terms  the default of leases or bankruptcy of third party lessees 
our ability to re lease or sell leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors  including  among others the cost of and demand for newer or specific use models  the availability in the market generally of other used or new railcars  the degree of obsolescence of leased railcars  the prevailing market and economic conditions  including interest and inflation rates  the need for refurbishment  the cost of materials and labor  and the volume of railcar traffic 
a downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to re market risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms  requiring us to re market leased railcars more frequently 
furthermore  the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers 
our inability to re lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
tilc s reserve for credit losses may prove inadequate 
tilc s reserve for possible credit losses is maintained based upon management s judgment of losses  history  and risks inherent in the railcar lease portfolio 
we periodically review our reserve for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends  collateral values  car type concentration risk including our ability to re market railcars  utilization levels of the lease fleet  market conditions of various industries  credit quality indicators  including external credit reports  past charge off experiences and levels of past due receivables 
we cannot be certain that our reserve for credit losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries or markets 
if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates  our reserves may be inadequate to cover credit losses  and any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition 
fluctuations in the supply of component parts used in the production of our railcar related and structural wind towers products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost effectively manufacture and sell our products 
a significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty components 
table of contents at competitive prices for the railcar business such as brakes  wheels  side frames  bolsters  and bearings as well as flanges for the wind towers business 
we depend on third party suppliers for a significant portion of our component part needs 
specialty components comprise a significant portion of the production cost of each railcar we manufacture 
due to consolidations and challenging industry conditions  the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  though generally a minimum of two suppliers continue to produce each type of component we use in our products 
while we endeavor to be diligent in contractual relationships with our suppliers  a significant decrease in the availability of specialty components could materially increase our cost of goods sold or prevent us from manufacturing our products on a timely basis 
reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating costs 
we use natural gas at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our products to customers and to operate our plant equipment 
over the past three years  prices for natural gas have fluctuated significantly 
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power and  in particular  a prolonged armed conflict in the middle east  could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general 
hurricanes or other natural disasters could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in natural gas prices or general energy costs 
speculative trading in energy futures in the world markets could also result in an increase in natural gas and general energy cost 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products and or an increase in energy costs  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively 
our manufacturer s warranties expose us to potentially significant claims 
depending on the product  we warrant against manufacturing defects due to our workmanship and certain materials pursuant to express limited contractual warranties 
accordingly  we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our mass production process or claims for which the cost of repairing or replacing the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part 
these types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls  significant repair costs  and damage to our reputation 
increasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk 
the nature of our business subjects us to product liability  property damage  and personal injury claims  especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that transport hazardous  toxic or volatile materials 
we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability claims and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms in the industries in which we operate and our historical claims experience 
over the last several years  insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries 
increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims within our self insured retention increases  we could suffer costs in excess of our reserves 
an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons 
in addition  the availability of  and our ability to collect on  insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured or not held to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
risks related to our operations outside of the united states could decrease our profitability 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to the risks associated with cross border business transactions and activities 
political  legal  trade  or economic changes or instability could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations 
some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety  railcar design and railcar component part design  performance  and manufacture of equipment used on their railroad systems 
if we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts within the various foreign countries where we operate  we may be unable to market and sell our railcars in those countries 
in addition  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment  adverse tax consequences  and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products difficult 
furthermore  any material change in the quotas  regulations  
table of contents or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and agencies  or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies  could affect our ability to export products that we manufacture in mexico 
because we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees  we may not be able to retain their services in the future 
our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees  none of whom currently have employment agreements with us 
although we have historically been successful in retaining the services of our key management  we may not be able to do so in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts  and other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate 
this could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials or component parts 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  revenues  and costs 
violations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may increase our operating costs 
we are subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory and industry authorities 
our railcar operations are subject to regulation by the united states environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration and the federal railroad administration  both divisions of the united states department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials 
future changes that affect compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
our inland barge operations are subject to regulation by the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
our operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation  investigations  or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation  investigations  or proceedings  that such costs would not be material to us 
we may be required to reduce our inventory carrying values  which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
to support our production line continuity  we ended with railcars in our finished goods inventory due to our decision to build railcars in anticipation of demand from tilc and external customers  including trip leasing 
we expect to sell this inventory in the normal course of business 
we are required to record all of our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments in respect to demand requirements and compare those with the current or committed inventory levels 
we have historically recorded reductions in inventory carrying values when product lines are discontinued or market conditions change as a result of changes in demand requirements 
we may be required to reduce inventory carrying values in the future due to a severe decline in market conditions  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may be required to reduce the value of our long lived assets and or goodwill  which would weaken our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate for potential impairment the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced commensurate with the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
in addition  we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based primarily on market conditions in the united states and the operational performance of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss related to reductions in the value of our long lived assets or our goodwill could weaken our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we seek to minimize these risks  when considered appropriate  through the use of interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities  although these measures may not be implemented or effective 
any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
company overview trinity industries  inc  headquartered in dallas  texas  is a multi industry company that owns a variety of market leading businesses which provide products and services to the industrial  energy  transportation  and construction sectors 
we operate in five distinct business groups which we report on a segment basis the rail group  construction products group  inland barge group  energy equipment group  and railcar leasing and management services group 
we also report all other which includes the company s captive insurance and transportation companies  legal  environmental  and upkeep costs associated with non operating facilities  other peripheral businesses  and the change in market valuation related to ineffective commodity hedges 
our rail and inland barge groups and our structural wind towers business operate in cyclical industries 
our construction products and energy equipment groups are subject to seasonal fluctuations with the first quarter historically being the weakest quarter 
fluctuations in the railcar leasing and management services group are primarily driven by railcar sales from the lease fleet 
the economic and financial crisis experienced by the united states economy during impacted our businesses 
during  market steel prices were extremely volatile and rose significantly during most of before eventually declining and leveling off at the end of the year 
however  we were able to mitigate the majority of this volatility through contract purchases  existing supplier commitments and price escalation clauses and other arrangements with our customers 
new orders for railcars dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of this year as the transportation industry saw a significant decline in business volumes 
the outlook for the transportation industry for appears to be for a significant downturn 
demand for structural wind towers dropped in the second half of the year as green energy companies experienced tightened credit markets and lower prices for electricity sales 
the slow down in the residential and commercial construction markets impacted our construction products group as well 
we continually assess our manufacturing capacity and take steps to align our production facilities with demand 
as a result of our assessment  we idled four railcar production facilities and one structural wind towers production facility during the fourth quarter of and early in executive summary the company s revenues for exceeded billion

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and december   we had approximately million and million  respectively  of tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to uncertain tax positions 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  insurance  restructuring costs  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and 
table of contents liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory we state all our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires the inventory to be analyzed at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and to record any required adjustments 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the asset might be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires management to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
we perform this testing for our five principal business segments the rail group  the construction products group  the inland barge group  the energy equipment group  and the railcar leasing and management services group 
an impairment loss generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions related to revenue and operating profit growth  discount rates and exit multiples 
we determined that there was no impairment of the recorded goodwill balance of million as of december  the company will continue to consider potential goodwill impairment indicators in  including a prolonged decline in our stock price and further business declines 
warranties the company provides warranties against workmanship and materials defects ranging from one to five years depending on the product 
the warranty costs are estimated using a two step approach 
first  an estimate is made for the cost of all claims that have been filed by customers 
second  based on historical claims experience  a cost is accrued for all products still within a warranty period for which no claims have been filed 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized related to products covered by warranties and assesses the adequacy of the resulting reserves on a quarterly basis 
insurance we are effectively self insured for workers compensation claims 
a third party administrator processes all such claims 
we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies 
to the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates  our liability may change 

table of contents contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or judgment costs for the resolution of certain of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
environmental we are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters 
we have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings  taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification 
however  estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or  if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings could be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of our total debt as of december  if interest rates average one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during  and our debt level remained constant  our interest expense would increase by million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if interest rates averaged one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during the year ended december   our interest expense would increase by million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates and scheduled principal payments on our variable rate debt obligations as of december  and a one percentage point increase in the interest rate yield would decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease in the interest rate yield would increase the fair value of fixed rate debt by approximately million
