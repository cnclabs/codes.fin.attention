item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading producer of thermal coal in the eastern united states  with operations and coal reserves in appalachia and the illinois basin  our operating segments 
we are also a leading us producer of metallurgical quality coal 
our principal business is the mining  preparation and sale of thermal coal  sold primarily to electric utilities  as well as the mining of metallurgical coal  sold to coke producers for use in the steelmaking process 
in  we sold million tons of coal  of which was sold to electric utilities and was sold to domestic and global steel producers 
in  we sold million tons of coal  of which was sold to domestic electric utilities and was sold to domestic and global steel producers 
we typically sell coal to utility and steel making customers under contracts with terms of one year or more 
approximately and of our sales were under such contracts during and  respectively 
our operations consist of sixteen mining complexes  which include company operated mines  contractor operated mines and coal preparation facilities 
the appalachia and illinois basin segments consist of our operations in west virginia and kentucky  respectively 
we ship coal to electric utilities  industrial users and metallurgical coal customers via various company owned and third party loading facilities and multiple rail and river transportation routes 
effective october   patriot was spun off from peabody energy corporation peabody 
the spin off was accomplished through a dividend of all outstanding shares of patriot  resulting in patriot becoming a separate  public company traded on the new york stock exchange symbol pcx 
on july   patriot completed the acquisition of magnum coal company magnum 
magnum was one of the largest coal producers in appalachia  operating mines and preparation plants with production from surface and underground mines and controlling more than million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
magnum s results are included as of the date the acquisition was consummated  july  effective august   patriot implemented a for stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend 
all share and per share amounts in this annual report on form k reflect this stock split 

table of contents basis of presentation related to periods prior to the spin off from peabody the statements of operations and cash flows for the twelve months ended december  and  and related discussions below primarily relate to our historical results prior to the spin off from peabody 
these results may not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and cash flows would have been as a stand alone company 
the consolidated financial statements presented herein for these periods include allocations of peabody expenses  assets and liabilities through the date of the spin off  including the following items selling and administrative expenses for the periods prior to spin off  our historical selling and administrative expenses were based on an allocation of peabody general corporate expenses to all of its mining operations  both foreign and domestic  based on principal activity  headcount  tons sold or revenues as appropriate 
the allocated expenses generally reflect service costs for marketing and sales  general accounting  legal  finance and treasury  public relations  human resources  environmental  engineering and internal audit 
interest expense for the periods prior to the spin off  our historical interest expense primarily related to fees for letters of credit and surety bonds used to guarantee our reclamation  workers compensation  retiree healthcare and lease obligations as well as interest expense related to intercompany notes with peabody 
our capital structure changed following our spin off from peabody  and effective october   we entered into a four year revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facility for information about our credit facility 
the intercompany notes totaling million with peabody were forgiven at spin off 
income tax provision income taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

we account for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the date of the balance sheet to differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  we consider projected realization of tax benefits based on expected levels of future taxable income  available tax planning strategies and the overall deferred tax position 
sfas no 
specifies that the amount of current and deferred tax expense for an income tax return group are to be allocated among the members of that group when those members issue separate financial statements 
for purposes of the consolidated financial statements prepared for the twelve months ended december  and for the other periods prior to the spin off  our income tax expense has been recorded as if we filed a consolidated tax return separate from peabody  notwithstanding that a majority of the operations were historically included in the us consolidated income tax return filed by peabody 
our valuation allowance for these periods was also determined on the separate tax return basis 
additionally  our tax attributes ie net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits for these periods have been determined based on us consolidated tax rules describing the apportionment of these items upon departure ie spin off from the peabody consolidated group 
peabody was managing its tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses 
peabody s tax strategies are not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that we would have followed or will follow as a stand alone company  nor were they necessarily strategies that optimized our stand alone position 
results of operations segment adjusted ebitda the discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our appalachia and illinois basin segments adjusted ebitda results 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss before deducting net interest income and expense  income taxes  minority interests  asset retirement obligation expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and net sales contract accretion excluding back to back coal purchase and sales contracts 
the net contract accretion on the back to back coal purchase and sale contracts reflects the net 
table of contents accretion related to certain coal purchase and sales contracts existing prior to july   whereby magnum purchased coal from third parties to fulfill tonnage commitments on sales contracts 
segment adjusted ebitda is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance 
because segment adjusted ebitda is not calculated identically by all companies  our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in item selected consolidated financial data 
segment adjusted ebitda excludes selling  general and administrative expenses  past mining obligation expense and gain on disposal or exchange of assets and is reconciled to its most comparable measure below under net income loss 
geologic conditions our results of operations are impacted by geologic conditions as they relate to coal mining  and these conditions refer to the physical nature of the coal seam and surrounding strata and its effect on the mining process 
geologic conditions that can have an adverse effect on underground mining include thinning coal seam thickness  rock partings within a coal seam  weak roof or floor rock  sandstone channel intrusions  groundwater and increased stresses within the surrounding rock mass due to over mining  under mining and overburden changes 
the term adverse geologic conditions is used in general to refer to these and similar situations where the geologic setting can negatively affect the normal mining process 
adverse geologic conditions would be markedly different from those that would be considered typical geological conditions for a given mine 
since approximately of our production is sourced from underground operations  geologic conditions are a major factor in our results of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary revenues were  million  an increase of million  and segment adjusted ebitda was million  an increase of million  for the year ended december  net income was million in compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
the increase in revenue  segment adjusted ebitda and net income was mainly driven by the newly acquired magnum operations including the impact of purchase accounting 
the results of operations of magnum are included in the appalachia mining operations segment from the date of acquisition 
was a volatile year in the coal markets 
coal prices significantly increased during the first half of the year  peaked in july and then declined in the later part of the year in conjunction with the overall economic downturn 
sales for our appalachia and illinois basin segments reflected higher contract and spot prices 
offsetting this increase  several of our mining complexes experienced adverse geologic conditions that impacted production levels as well as higher costs related to labor  fuel  and materials and supplies 

table of contents tons sold and revenues year ended december  increase decrease tons dollars and tons in thousands  except per ton amounts tons sold appalachia illinois basin total tons sold revenue appalachia mining operations illinois basin mining operations appalachia other total revenues average sales price per ton sold appalachia illinois basin the increase in appalachia revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily related to million of sales associated with the newly acquired magnum operations 
excluding the impact of magnum  revenues were also affected by higher average sales prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes at the federal and rocklick mining complexes 
average sales prices increased at our mining complexes  reflecting higher sales contract pricing  including the repricing of a major coal supply agreement with peabody as part of the spin off  and cost recovery under certain contracts for increased regulatory costs 
sales volumes in the appalachia segment increased in  primarily due to million tons sold from the newly acquired magnum operations 
excluding magnum  sales volume decreased primarily due to production shortfalls at our federal complex  the completion of the final longwall panel at the harris mine during the second quarter  labor shortages for much of the year and reduced productivity at several mines 
illinois basin revenue increased in primarily related to higher average sales prices 
compared to the prior year  sales volumes increased slightly 
other appalachia revenues increased in in addition to increased royalty income  other revenues included a structured settlement on a property transaction  a settlement for past due coal royalties  which had previously been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of collection  and gains on the sale of purchased coal in the first quarter 
segment adjusted ebitda year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands appalachia illinois basin segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia increased in from the prior year primarily due to the contribution from the newly acquired magnum operations and  to a lesser extent  higher sales prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher operating costs 
higher operating costs related to start up costs as we ramped up production at our big mountain and kanawha eagle mining complexes  as well as higher contract mining costs primarily related to higher material and supply and labor costs 
material and supply costs were primarily impacted 
table of contents by higher fuel  explosives and steel related costs 
higher labor costs were reflective of an overall labor shortage in the appalachia region 
segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia also increased in due to the previously mentioned gains on the sale of purchased coal in the first quarter and the structured settlements in the second quarter 
segment adjusted ebitda for the illinois basin increased in primarily due to higher average sales prices  offset by increased labor costs and higher fuel  explosives and steel related costs 
net income loss year ended increase decrease to december  income dollars in thousands segment adjusted ebitda corporate and other past mining obligation expense net gain on disposal or exchange of assets selling and administrative expenses total corporate and other depreciation  depletion and amortization sales contract accretion  net   n a asset retirement obligation expense interest expense peabody   n a third party interest income income loss before income taxes and minority interest minority interests   n a net income loss effect of minority purchase arrangement   n a net income loss attributable to common stockholders past mining obligation expense past mining obligation expenses were lower in than the prior year primarily due to the retention by peabody of a portion of the retiree healthcare liability at spin off and a higher discount rate associated with the expenses 
past mining obligation expense at the newly acquired magnum operations totaled million for the period beginning july   the acquisition date  primarily associated with retiree healthcare liabilities 
net gain on disposal or exchange of assets net gain on disposal or exchange of assets was million lower for compared to the prior year 
the net gain on disposal or exchange of assets for included a million gain on the exchange sale of certain leasehold mineral interests 
the net gain on disposal or exchange of assets for included coal reserve transactions that resulted in gains of million 
selling and administrative expenses our historical selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were based on an allocation of peabody general corporate expenses to all of its mining operations  both foreign and domestic 
selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  represent our actual expenses incurred as a 
table of contents stand alone company  including expenses from the newly acquired magnum operations  which overall were lower than the prior year allocation 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization for increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the additional sales volume associated with the acquisition of magnum 
sales contract accretion sales contract accretion resulted from the below market coal sale and purchase contracts acquired in the magnum acquisition and recorded at preliminarily determined fair values in purchase accounting 
the net liability generated from applying fair value to these contracts is being accreted over the life of the contracts as the coal is shipped 
asset retirement obligation expense asset retirement obligation expense decreased in compared to the prior year primarily due to accelerated reclamation work at closed mines in the first half of  the acceleration of a mine closure in early  and the extension of the life of our federal mine in mid as a result of the acquisition of adjoining coal reserves  largely offset by expenses related to the newly acquired magnum operations 
interest expense income interest expense increased for compared to the prior year primarily due to interest and amortized origination debt fees related to our credit facility  put in place at the time of the spin off  as well as interest and amortized origination debt fees related to our newly issued convertible debt and a commitment fee expensed in the second quarter due to the termination of a bridge loan facility related to the magnum acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction to interest expense in as a demand note with peabody was forgiven at the spin off  resulting in no similar interest expense in see liquidity and capital resources for details concerning our outstanding debt and credit facility 
interest income increased in compared to the prior year due to interest on a black lung excise tax refund 
in addition  the company recognized a full year of interest income on notes receivable that resulted from the sale of coal reserves in the first half of income tax provision for the years ended december  and  no income tax provision was recorded due to net operating losses for the year and our full valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
for  the primary difference between book and taxable income was the treatment of the net sales contract accretion on the below market purchase and sales contracts acquired in the magnum acquisition  with such amounts being included in the computation of book income but excluded from the computation of taxable income 
minority interests we acquired an effective controlling interest in ke ventures  llc during the first quarter of  and began consolidating ke ventures  llc in our results in the portion of earnings that represents the interests of the minority owners was deducted from our income loss before income taxes and minority interests to determine net income loss 
the minority interest recorded in represented the share of ke ventures  llc earnings in which the minority holders were entitled to participate 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased our ownership in ke ventures to 
effect of minority purchase arrangement at the spin off  the minority interest holders of ke ventures  llc held an option that could require patriot to purchase the remaining of ke ventures  llc upon a change in control 
upon the spin off from peabody  the minority owners of ke ventures  llc exercised this option  and we acquired the remaining minority interest in ke 
table of contents ventures  llc on november  for million 
because the option requiring patriot to purchase ke ventures  llc is considered a mandatorily redeemable instrument outside of our control  amounts paid to the minority interest holders in excess of carrying value of the minority interests in ke ventures  llc  or million  was reflected as an increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders in this obligation was fully redeemed as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary revenues were  million and segment adjusted ebitda was million for the year ended december   both lower than the prior year primarily driven by lower sales volumes due to production shortfalls 
production shortfalls resulted from a delayed longwall move at one of our mines and increased levels of adverse geologic conditions including excessive groundwater from heavy spring rains  roof falls and roof partings 
net loss was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the increased net loss was mainly driven by the lower sales volumes and higher operating costs 
tons sold and revenues year ended december  increase decrease tons dollars and tons in thousands  except per ton amounts tons sold appalachia illinois basin total tons sold revenue appalachia illinois basin total revenues average sales price per ton sold appalachia illinois basin the decrease in the appalachia revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year reflected lower sales volumes driven by adverse geologic conditions  a delayed longwall move at one of our mines  and the loss of a coal supplier in late  partially offset by additional volumes from the black stallion contract mine  which began production in the third quarter of adverse geologic conditions included roof falls and partings that reduced saleable coal yields 
the decrease in the illinois basin revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year reflected reduced sales volumes associated mainly with the closure of the big run mine  partially offset by higher pricing principally resulting from a price increase on a long term contract under the market price adjustment provision of the contract 
segment adjusted ebitda year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands appalachia illinois basin    n a segment adjusted ebitda 
table of contents segment adjusted ebitda for appalachia decreased in from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume as described above and higher operating costs primarily due to additional materials and supplies required for the delayed longwall move at one of our mines  roof control  equipment repair and maintenance  as well as higher labor expenses related to a labor agreement that became effective on january   partially offset by lower revenue based taxes and royalties 
segment adjusted ebitda for the illinois basin increased in from the prior year primarily due to the higher average sales price as discussed above 
operating costs decreased in compared to the prior year primarily due to the closure of the big run mine  partially offset by higher costs related to preparation plant maintenance and additional equipment requirements at one of our mines associated with roof falls and excessive water

our and operating costs included approximately million and million  respectively  for certain retiree healthcare obligation expenses that would have been assumed by peabody had the proposed spin off occurred at the beginning of each period 
net gain on disposal of assets net gain on disposal of assets was million higher for the net gain for the period was attributable principally to the sale of million tons of coal reserves  and surface land in kentucky and the big run mine for million in cash and million in notes receivable which resulted in a gain of million

the decrease of million in compared to reflected changes in peabody s allocable selling and administrative expenses as well as changes to the allocation base 
these allocated expenses are not necessarily indicative of the costs we would incur as a stand alone company 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization for decreased slightly compared to primarily due to the closure of the big run mine 
asset retirement obligation expense asset retirement obligation expense decreased in compared to the prior year primarily due to accelerated reclamation work at closed mines in with less activity in interest expense income third party interest expense decreased in as ke ventures  llc repaid million in bank loans in the second half of and replaced the bank debt with a peabody note which was subsequently forgiven at spin off 
interest income increased in compared to the prior year due to additional interest income on notes receivable that resulted from the sale of kentucky coal reserves in the second half of and the first half of income tax provision in  we incurred million of tax obligation for federal taxes from the disposal of assets and the preference limitation on percentage depletion 
patriot was included in peabody s consolidated group during and the consolidated group had sufficient net operating losses available to offset the taxable income of patriot  so this tax obligation did not require patriot to make cash payments 
minority interests we acquired an effective controlling interest in ke ventures  llc during the first quarter of  and began consolidating ke ventures  llc in our results in the portion of earnings that represents the interests of the minority owners was deducted from our income loss before income taxes and minority interests to determine net income loss

table of contents outlook market the recent global recession resulted in decreased demand worldwide for steel and electricity beginning in the third quarter of since the beginning of the fourth quarter  production utilization at us steel mills has dropped from approximately to 
globally  blast furnace iron production decreased during the fourth quarter 
as a result  domestic and international steel mills have significantly reduced coal purchases 
historically  during periods of economic downturn  world demand for basic inputs  including for electricity and steel production  have decreased 
traded prices for thermal coal delivered into northern europe decreased during the fourth quarter of us producers that previously sold into the export thermal market are now selling their coals into the us thermal market 
additionally  increased production and decreased industrial demand of natural gas have caused natural gas prices to decrease during the fourth quarter of at the same time  electricity consumption declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
as a result of the redirected export and metallurgical coal shipments  decreased natural gas prices and lower coal fueled electricity demand  traded us thermal coal prices have fallen approximately since the beginning of the fourth quarter 
throughout the industry  mines will likely close and expansions will be curtailed if coal prices fall below marginal costs 
in the us and internationally  approximately and million tons  respectively  of production cuts for have been announced 
in the us  mine closures have been a mix of thermal and metallurgical coal  while most international mine closures have been at australian  canadian and russian metallurgical coal mines 
additional reductions are expected during as suppliers react to lower demand and pricing 
as the result of lower coal fueled generation  eastern us utility coal stockpiles grew during the fourth quarter of however  eastern coal inventories were only million tons higher than a year ago and are at the approximate mid point of their five year range 
while the weak global economy is negatively affecting the coal industry in the short term  coal s long term future remains positive 
prior to the recent economic recession  international coal markets had been growing  driven by increased demand from the growing economies of china and india where coal is both the primary domestic source of fuel and the lowest cost imported fuel for electricity generation 
we do not currently sell coal into china  but chinese demand is important in determining worldwide coal prices and global supply 
prior to the recent economic recession  domestic demand increases in south africa  vietnam  and russia had also resulted in lower exports from those countries 
brazil had been experiencing increased steel production resulting in the need for more coal imports 
additionally  the coal industries in germany and poland have been shutting down as their coal reserves deplete  and coal exports from australia  a major coal producer  have been impacted by infrastructure limitations driven by rail and port constraints 
we believe that as the economy recovers  supply and demand will come back into balance 
further  mine closures in should accelerate the return to market equilibrium 
patriot operations as discussed more fully under item a 
risk factors  our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by unforeseen adverse geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations  increased labor costs due to the shortage of skilled labor  the inability of contract miners to fulfill delivery terms of their contracts  delays in obtaining required permits for new mining operations  coal mining laws and regulations  rising prices of key supplies  mining equipment and commodities  the unavailability of transportation for coal shipments  the availability and costs of credit  surety bonds and letters of credit  and the recent economic recession 
on a long term basis  our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves  our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and contract miners  our ability to find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts  and the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine  increase our mining costs  or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation 
if upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
in  we experienced higher costs related to steel related products including roof control  replacement parts  belting products  fuel  explosives  contract mining and healthcare 
however  these prices 
table of contents declined during the second half of in conjunction with a comprehensive strategic review of operations upon acquisition of magnum  management has continued to focus on controlling costs and optimizing performance 
in light of the magnum acquisition  we have performed a comprehensive strategic review of our mining complexes and their relative cost structures 
we announced the idling of our jupiter mining complex in october in january  we announced the idling of our remington mining complex and black oak mine and reduced activity at the rocklick preparation plant 
we are reacting to the changes in demand by refining our production plans and optimizing our mining complexes with the goal of becoming more cost competitive 
operationally  we have experienced adverse geologic conditions that have impacted our federal and panther longwall operations and accordingly  our financial results during in the fourth quarter of  we upgraded our longwall shearer at the panther complex 
we anticipate improved mining conditions at both the federal and panther complexes by the end of the first quarter of we have adjusted the mine plan for future panels at both complexes to minimize the impact of difficult geology 
our industry continues to face new regulations and more aggressive enforcement surrounding both environmental and mining statutes 
with this more costly regulatory landscape  we are aggressively seeking customer reimbursement under applicable coal supply agreements 
we are also actively pursuing the restructuring of certain below market legacy coal supply agreements 
we are targeting sales volume of to million tons 
as of december   our total unpriced planned production for included up to million tons of met volumes and up to million tons of thermal volumes 
of expected volumes  up to million tons of met and up to million tons of thermal volumes remained unpriced as of december  the guidance provided under the caption outlook should be read in conjunction with the section entitled cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements on page and item a

risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
employee related liabilities we have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
expense for the year ended december  for these liabilities totaled million  while payments were million 
our postretirement benefit and certain components of our workers compensation obligations are actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for these items 
our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities 
we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree healthcare and work related injuries and illness obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data 

table of contents if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 
our most significant employee liability is postretirement healthcare 
assumed discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for healthcare plans 
below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
healthcare cost trend rate dollars in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on gain loss amortization component effect on total postretirement benefit obligation discount rate dollars in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on gain loss amortization component effect on total postretirement benefit obligation asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both underground and surface mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit 
asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including  among other items  estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities 
asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended december   was million  and payments totaled million 
see detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance  we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period this determination is made 
as of december  and  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we have also adopted interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 

table of contents additional detail regarding how we account for income taxes and the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in note revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned 
we generated substantially all of our revenue in from the sale of coal to our customers 
revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer 
coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements  most of which have a term of one year or more 
under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements  risk of loss transfers to the customer at the mine or port  where coal is loaded to the rail  barge  ocean going vessel  truck or other transportation source that delivers coal to its destination 
with respect to other revenues  other operating income  or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal  we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate 
we do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
share based compensation we have an equity incentive plan for employees and eligible non employee directors that allows for the issuance of share based compensation in the form of restricted stock  incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  performance awards  restricted stock units and deferred stock units 
we recognize share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise  the associated volatility  and a risk free rate 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
impairment of long lived assets impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets under various assumptions are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the impaired asset to its carrying amount 
there were no impairment losses recorded during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 business combinations 
under this method of accounting  the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the net assets acquired 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment  and the utilization of independent valuation experts  and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  assumptions with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers  sales of non core assets and financing transactions 
our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production  capital expenditures  interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions 
our ability to service our debt interest and principal and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations or borrowed funds as necessary 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the prior year 
this increase in net cash provided related to improved operating results of million  as well as positive working capital changes of million

as of december  the balance of outstanding letters of credit issued against the credit facility totaled million  and million short term borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
availability under the credit facility as of december  was million 
the obligations under our credit facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including but not limited to certain of our mines and coal reserves and related fixtures and accounts receivable 
the credit facility contains certain customary covenants  including financial covenants limiting our total indebtedness maximum leverage ratio of and requiring minimum ebitda coverage of interest expense minimum interest coverage ratio of  as well as certain limitations on  among other things  additional debt  liens  investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures  future dividends and asset sales 
the credit facility calls for quarterly reporting of compliance with financial covenants 
the financial covenants are calculated based on pro forma results as if we acquired magnum on january  and ebitda as defined by the credit agreement 
the terms of the credit facility also contain certain customary events of default  which will give the lender the right to accelerate payments of outstanding debt in certain circumstances 
customary events of default include breach of covenants  failure to maintain required ratios  failure to make principal payments or to make interest or fee payments within a grace period  and default  beyond any applicable grace period  on any of our other indebtedness exceeding a certain amount

interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning november  the notes mature on may   unless converted  repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and are senior to any subordinated debt 
patriot used the proceeds of the offering to repay magnum s existing senior secured indebtedness and acquisition related fees and expenses 
all remaining amounts were used for other general corporate purposes 
the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of patriot s common stock during the period from issuance to february   subject to certain conditions of conversion as described below 
the conversion rate for the notes is shares of patriot s common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate and the conversion price are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events  such as a future stock split or a distribution of a stock dividend 
the notes require patriot to settle all conversions by paying cash for the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the notes  and by settling any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in cash or shares  at our option 
holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding february   only under the following circumstances during the five trading day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of patriot s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day  during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending september   and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of patriot s common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day  if such holder s notes have been called for redemption or upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the indenture 
the notes will be convertible  regardless of the foregoing circumstances  at any time from  and including  february  until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
the number of shares of patriot s common stock that we may deliver upon conversion will depend on the price of its common stock during an observation period as described in the indenture 
specifically  the number of shares deliverable upon conversion will increase as the common stock price increases above the conversion price of per share during the observation period 
the maximum number of shares that patriot may deliver is  however  if certain fundamental changes occur in patriot s business that are deemed make whole fundamental changes in the indenture  the number of shares deliverable on conversion may increase  up to a maximum amount of  shares 
these maximum amounts are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events  such as a stock split or a distribution of a stock dividend 
holders of the notes may require patriot to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change in patriot s business  as defined in the indenture 
the holders would receive cash for of the principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
patriot may redeem i some or all of the notes at any time on or after may   but only if the last reported sale price of patriot s common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date patriot provides the relevant notice of redemption exceeds of the 
table of contents conversion price in effect on each such trading day  or ii all of the notes if at any time less than million in aggregate principal amount of notes remain outstanding 
in both cases  notes will be redeemed for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  the relevant redemption date

per the guidance set forth in sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 this additional interest feature is considered an embedded derivative 
management has determined the fair value of this embedded derivative is de minimis as the probability of reports not being filed timely is remote and we have no history of late submissions 
the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  or any state securities laws

these arrangements include guarantees  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements

newly adopted accounting pronouncements fasb statement no 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measures 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
sfas no 
establishes a three level fair value hierarchy for fair value to be measured based on the observability of the inputs utilized in the valuation 
the levels are level inputs from quoted prices in an active market  level inputs other than a quoted price market that are directly or indirectly observable through market corroborated inputs and level inputs that are unobservable and require assumptions about pricing by market participants 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we elected to implement sfas no 
with the one year deferral permitted by fasb issued staff position fas fsp sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for those items that are recognized or 
table of contents disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the deferral applies to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp sfas  which clarified the application of sfas no 
in an inactive market and demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp sfas was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the adoption of fsp sfas did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition since we did not have any financial assets in inactive markets 
fasb statement no 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
entities electing the fair value option are required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense upfront costs and fees associated with each item for which the fair value option is elected 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas no 
on january   with no impact to the financial statements upon adoption since we did not elect fair value treatment for any items not currently required to be measured at fair value 
pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements fasb statement no 
r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no 
and retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
 including that the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this standard defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control instead of the date that the consideration is transferred 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values 
sfas no 
r becomes effective for us for any business combination with an acquisition date on or after january  we will evaluate the potential impact of sfas no 
r on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition for applicable transactions subsequent to fasb statement no 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
expands the disclosure requirement for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement specifically requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about its use of derivative instruments  the accounting for derivatives and related hedge items  and the related affect on an entity s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  january  for us 
while we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have on our disclosures  the adoption of sfas no 
will not affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fasb staff position apb in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb changes the accounting for our convertible notes  specifying that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may settle in cash upon conversion must bifurcate the proceeds from the debt issuance between debt and equity components in a manner that reflects the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the equity component would reflect the value of the conversion feature of the notes 
fsp apb is 
table of contents effective for fiscal years beginning after december  january  for us 
fsp apb requires retrospective application to all periods presented and does not grandfather existing debt instruments 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fsp apb on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the preliminary estimate of our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate is approximately to as compared to the coupon rate of the notes 
the adoption of this position will result in an increase in stockholders equity for the equity component of the notes and a corresponding decrease or discount to the million face value of the notes 
the amortization of the convertible debt discount will result in an increase to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes 
fasb staff position eitf in june  the fasb issued fsp no 
eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents before vesting should be considered participating securities and need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method 
the two class method of computing earnings per share is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  january  for us with all prior period earnings per share data being adjusted retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the effect fsp eitf will have on our calculation of earnings per share 
eitf in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue  accounting for equity method investments fsp eitf  because of questions raised regarding the application of the equity method after fasb statement and fasb statement r were issued 
this eitf issue addresses other than temporary impairment  the accounting for gains or losses on issuance of shares by the investee and the loss of significant influence such that the accounting method must change 
eitf is effective on a prospective basis for transactions in an investee s shares occurring or impairments recognized in fiscal years  beginning after december  we do not expect eitf to have a significant impact on the accounting for our equity investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the potential for changes in the market value of our coal portfolio is referred to as market risk 
due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term  illiquid nature of the positions  we have not quantified market risk related to our portfolio of coal supply agreements 
we manage our commodity price risk for our coal contracts through the use of long term coal supply agreements  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we sold of our sales volume under coal supply agreements with terms of one year or more during as of december  our total unpriced planned production for was up to million tons and for was up to million tons 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into long term coal contracts with marketing affiliates of peabody 
the arrangements  except as described below under credit risk  have substantially similar terms and conditions as the pre existing contractual obligations of peabody s marketing affiliate 
these arrangements may be amended or terminated only with the mutual agreement of peabody and patriot 
with the addition of magnum  our commodity risk profile has changed as our annual usage of diesel fuel has increased significantly 
to manage this risk  we have entered into swap contracts with financial institutions 
these derivative contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated diesel fuel purchases 
as of december   the notional amounts outstanding for these swaps included million gallons of heating oil  which expire throughout and million gallons of heating oil expiring throughout we expect to purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel annually 
aside from these hedging activities  a per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would impact our annual operating costs by approximately million 

table of contents credit risk a major portion of our revenues is generated through sales to a marketing affiliate of peabody  and we will continue to supply coal to peabody on a contract basis as described above  so peabody can meet its commitments under pre existing customer agreements sourced from our operations 
one of these arrangements with peabody provides for the adjustment of a major existing coal sales agreement sourced from patriot s operations to increase the price paid to us thereunder 
the term of the last pre existing customer arrangement between patriot and peabody will expire on december  our remaining sales are made directly to electric utilities  industrial companies and steelmakers 
therefore  our concentration of credit risk is with peabody  as well as electric utilities and steelmakers 
our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended 
in the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards  we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to mitigate our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations 
these steps may include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay 
while the economic recession may affect our customers  we do not anticipate that it will significantly affect our overall credit risk profile due to our credit policies 
additionally  as of december   we had million in notes receivable outstanding  arising out of the sale of coal reserves and surface land discussed above 
of this amount  is from a single counterparty 
each of these notes contains a cross collaterization provision secured primarily by the underlying coal reserves and surface land
