overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the bank since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker  lowndes  thomas  and worth counties  each contiguous with colquitt county  and the surrounding counties of southwest georgia 
we have four full service banking facilities  a loan production office  and six automated teller machines 
our strategy is to maintain the diversity of our revenue  including both interest and noninterest income through a broad base of business  strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees to provide the best possible service to our customers  expand our market share where opportunity exists  and grow outside of our current geographic market either through de novo branching or acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
we believe that investing in sales and marketing in this challenging market will provide us with a competitive advantage 
to that end  we have continued with our plans to expand geographically with a loan production office in valdosta  georgia 
we have leadership in place and have identified a permanent site for a de novo branch 
the corporation s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans  securities and federal funds sold  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  after holding the overnight borrowing rate for banks at for eight months of  the federal reserve bank decreased short term interest rates by to from september to the end of our profitability is impacted as well by operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local factors such as changes in population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing uses of funds and investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation s primary market area 
to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
in addition  broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which is outside of our control 
sources of noninterest income include our insurance agency and empire  the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  as well as fees on customer accounts  and trust and retail brokerage services 
in  noninterest income was of net interest income 
we continually focus on asset quality and realized improvement in with non performing assets declining from the previous year 
at the end of  the majority in non performing assets was one large loan placed on interest nonaccrual in late this loan was partially charged off during the fourth quarter of since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the financial markets and economic conditions generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all commercial and residential mortgages as property prices declined rapidly and to nearly all asset classes 
the effect of the market and economic downturn also spread to other areas of the credit markets and in the availability of liquidity 
the magnitude of these declines led to a crisis of confidence in the financial sector as a result of concerns about the capital base and viability of certain financial institutions 
during this period  interbank lending and commercial paper borrowing fell sharply  precipitating a credit freeze for both institutional and individual borrowers 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates have on the corporation s results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate  however  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that would have resulted in material estimates and assumptions changes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
results of operations performance summary net loss for was million  a decrease of approximately million when compared with net income of million in the decrease in annual net income was largely attributable to a million non cash loss on the impairment of equity securities and a million loss at our mortgage banking subsidiary recognized during the third quarter of the non cash loss on the impairment of equity securities was due to the devaluation of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock that we held in our security portfolio 
these securities lost value as a result of the us government s actions to place these government sponsored enterprises in conservatorship  and mark to market accounting rules require such a non cash impairment loss to be reported through income 
the loss related to the mortgage banking subsidiary was realized as a result of covering other shortfalls of participant banks from a sale of foreclosed commercial property 
also  negatively impacting net income was a provision for loan losses of thousand taken during the fourth quarter of this provision resulted from a thousand partial charge off related to a large commercial real estate loan 
these decreases in net income were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of thousand mainly attributed to lower interest expense on deposits 
on a per share basis  we had a net loss in of per diluted share compared with net income of per diluted share for net income for was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  when compared with million in our net income was down primarily as a result of a million loss sustained during the fourth quarter by the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary realized from its covering of the shortfall of participant banks related to a sale of foreclosed commercial property 
also  other decreases in annual net income were attributable to a decrease in interest income related to a lower earning asset base and a decline in revenue from mortgage banking services 
this decline was partially offset by a thousand gain on the sale of the corporation s retail credit card portfolio in september the sale of the credit card portfolio was a move to reduce the risk profile of the bank 
on a per share basis  net income for was down to per diluted share compared with 
per diluted share for we measure our performance on selected key ratios  which are provided for the last three years in the following table caption

net interest income net interest income after the provision for loan losses for decreased thousand  or  when compared with the benefit of reduced costs of funds was more than offset by the thousand provision for loan loss which was necessary due to the charge offs experienced in the fourth quarter of excluding the provision for loan loss  net interest income would have increased by thousand 
another factor contributing to the decline in net interest income was the decrease in interest and fees on loans of thousand 
interest and fees on loans were impacted by a drop in the prime rate since september  which reduced interest earned on variable and adjustable rate loans 
in addition  the bank holds one large loan that was placed on interest nonaccrual status in late the decrease in interest on securities was mainly due to the million drop in the average volume of investments 
these decreases in interest income were offset by million in lower interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the bulk of this decrease was in interest on deposits due to a declining interest rate environment 
the average rate paid on average time deposits of million decreased basis points compared with net interest income after the provision for loan losses for decreased thousand  or  compared with major factors contributing to the decline in net interest income compared with were a decline of thousand in interest income on a lower volume of investment securities 
this lower average volume was mainly due to the selling of million of investment securities in the last half of to fund the stock tender offer and investment securities maturing in from which proceeds were not reinvested in new investment securities  and a thousand increase in interest expense primarily related to higher rates on deposits and debt 
an increase of basis points was paid on million of average time deposits and basis points increase were paid on million of average debt 
partly offsetting the lower interest income on investment securities and higher interest expense was increased interest income from loans in compared with the majority of the increase in loan interest income for the year resulted from a combination of volume and yield components 
average loan volumes increased million  or  and the yield increased basis points to  resulting in an increase in interest income of thousand 
net interest margin net interest margin  which is the net return on earning assets  is a key performance ratio for evaluating net interest income 
it is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
net interest margin improved to for  a basis point increase from net interest margin was for  a basis point decrease from in this improvement in margin was impacted by the lower interest rate environment on interest bearing deposits along with the volume growth in loans and increase in yields on purchased securities

in addition  mortgage banking services income decreased thousand  or  in  as the credit crisis has made the mortgage funding environment challenging and has restricted loan opportunities 
revenue from service charges on deposit accounts decreased thousand  and income from insurance services and trust services decreased thousand and thousand  respectively  when compared with the same period last year

also  there was a net loss of thousand in sales of foreclosed property primarily related to the sale of one large commercial property 
other year over year decreases in revenue included trust services and insurance services 
the declines in revenue were partially offset by a thousand gain on the sale of the retail credit card portfolio in in addition  retail brokerage services income had growth of thousand  or  and income from service charges on deposit accounts grew thousand  or  when compared with the prior year 
additionally  noninterest income in was negatively impacted by a nonrecurring thousand loss on the sale of securities to fund the corporation s stock tender offer in that year

total noninterest expense decreased thousand to million in compared with the same period last year 
the major cause of the decrease in noninterest expense was a reduction in losses related to mortgage banking services of thousand in the decline of amortization of intangible assets of thousand reflects the full amortization of the mortgage banking intangibles in these decreases are partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to the settlement of a compensation agreement and the staffing of our new loan production office in valdosta  georgia 
other operating expenses were up due to higher legal fees as it relates to mortgage banking services as well as operating expenses relating to the valdosta loan production office 
total noninterest expense increased thousand  or  in compared with the majority of this increase was related to the million loss sustained during the fourth quarter by the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary realized as a result of covering the shortfall of participant banks related to the sale of foreclosed commercial property 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in salary and employee benefits  amortization of intangible assets  and other operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits decreased as a result of a lower amount required to fund the pension plan in of thousand  compared with million in also  was the last year of contributions to the deferred compensation plan  resulting in a thousand expense reduction in another factor in the decrease in salaries and employee benefits was the decrease in officer performance compensation primarily related to the mortgage banking subsidiary s lower profitability in compared with in  the officer performance compensation was thousand compared with thousand in amortization of intangible assets decreased thousand to thousand in this reduction resulted from returning to a normal level after accelerating the amortization of our mortgage servicing assets due to the large payoffs of serviced loans in other operating expenses declined thousand compared with due to professional services related to the tender offer and to pension consulting expenses in the efficiency ratio noninterest expense divided by total noninterest income plus net interest income  a measure of productivity  increased to for  from for and for the higher efficiency ratio was primarily due to the loss related to mortgage banking services and lower revenue as a result of the non cash impairment loss on equity securities

uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
during  total average assets decreased million  or  to million 
the corporation s earning assets  which include loans  investment securities  deposits at the federal home loan bank  and federal funds sold averaged million in  a decrease over million in this decrease was primarily the result of decreased average volume in investment securities due to improved average loan volume  federal funds sold  and deposits at the federal home loan bank 
the earning asset mix shifted towards higher average loans 
for  average earning assets were comprised of loans  investment securities  and federal funds sold and balances held at the federal home loan bank 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets increased slightly to for compared with for loans loans are one of the corporation s largest earning assets and uses of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio

the ratio of total loans to total deposits at year end increased to in compared with in the loan portfolio mix at year end consisted of loans secured by construction real estate  loans secured by commercial real estate  of loans secured by residential real estate  and of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
the loan portfolio also included other commercial  financial  and agricultural purposes of and installment loans to individuals for consumer purposes of 
allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have a loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other potentially impaired loans that have been identified as possible problems 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented a thousand decrease from the corresponding year end amount which was of total loans outstanding 
there was a provision for loan losses of thousand in and no provision for loan losses in the provision was related to a partial charge off of a large commercial real estate loan in the fourth quarter of our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb possible losses in the loan portfolio resulted in not having to provide for losses in see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the changes in the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities consist largely of us government sponsored pass thru mortgage backed securities and us government agency bonds 
the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in securities are used as a source of income to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability  and is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements 
our investment policy attempts to provide adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with significant cash flow for reinvestment

the total investment portfolio decreased to million from million at year end compared with year end  a decrease of million  or 
the majority of this decrease was due to the maturing of million of us government agency securities and the calling  by the issuer  of approximately million of us government agency securities during with some of the proceeds  we purchased million of securities of which the majority were in us government sponsored mortgage backed securities 
other purchases were of us government agency bonds  corporate notes  and preferred stock issues 
the average total investment portfolio decreased million to million in compared with million for we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing  renegotiated loans  potential problem loans and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets decreased thousand at year end compared with year end this decrease primarily resulted from the partial charge off of thousand on the one large loan placed in nonaccrual loans in late nonperforming assets were approximately million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits decreased slightly compared with  from million to million 
many of our now accounts with low transaction volume were reclassified during to money market accounts which resulted in a change in the deposit mix 
the reclassification is an accounting transaction and does not impact customer account balances or their fdic coverage 
as a result of the low rate environment  balances in our commercial customers money market accounts were reduced by the end of the year 
as of december   the corporation had a total of million in certificates of deposit of  or more 
this was a decrease from the million total in we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation borrowed million as advances from the federal home loan bank and repaid million of short term advances 
during  million of advances is expected to be repaid 
total long term advances with the federal home loan bank were million at december  details on the federal home bank advances are presented in note to the financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is managed to assume that the corporation can meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing funds to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from deposits  interest and fee income  loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
the consolidated statement of cash flows details the corporation s cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  operating activities provided cash flows of million  while investing and financing activities used million resulting in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents balances of million 
net cash provided by operations continues to provide cash for the payment of dividends 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation s deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less public funds and time deposits of  or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits were of total deposits on december   compared with in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity  such as cash which is received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments which can be easily converted to cash without significant loss 
the corporation s investment securities maturing within one year or less were million on december   which represented of the investment debt securities portfolio 
also  the corporation has million of us government agency securities callable at the option of the issuer and approximately million of annual cash flow in principal reductions from payments of mortgage backed securities 
due to the drop in the short term rate by the federal reserve since september  most all of our callable securities were called in we have reinvested these proceeds from called investment securities in new loans  new investment securities  and for repayment of our short term and long term debt obligations 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a non cash loss on the impairment of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock of million 
we are not aware of any other known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and its scheduled future cash payments under those commitments as of december  the majority of the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations were long term debt

off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which arise in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

capital resources and dividends our average equity to average assets ratio was in and in the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued rules regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an total risk based ratio  of which must consist primarily of tangible common shareholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a leverage ratio 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
to continue to conduct its business as currently conducted  the corporation and the bank will need to maintain capital well above the minimum levels

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s primary market risk is exposure to interest rate movements 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by the bank 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio that staggers maturities and provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity 
the table below provides information about the corporation s financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for each rate sensitive asset and liability listed  the table presents principal balances and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity or the earliest possible repricing opportunity dates 
one of the indicators for our interest rate sensitivity position is the measurement of the difference between its rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which is referred to as the gap 
a gap analysis displays the earliest possible repricing opportunity for each asset and liability category based upon contractual maturities and repricing 
at year end  our sensitivity ratio  or one year cumulative rate sensitive assets relative to cumulative rate sensitive liabilities  was compared with for this change in the sensitivity ratio was a result of the corporation s management of its exposure to interest rate risk 
we are more asset sensitive at the one year gap position compared with our asset sensitivity in the previous year 
these changes in assets occurred in increase in investment securities that will mature or have the potential of being called within one year  and increase in variable rate loans 
this asset sensitive position will increase the corporation s earning potential in a rising interest rate environment 
all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same pace  therefore  the sensitivity ratio is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
we monitor our asset and liability mix in an effort to ensure that the effects of interest rate movements in either direction are not significant over time
