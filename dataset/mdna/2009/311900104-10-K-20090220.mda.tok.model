item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
certain tabular information will not foot due to rounding 
business overview fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies 
we operate stores primarily located in north america 
on december   we operated  company owned or leased store locations 
most of our customers are in the manufacturing and construction markets 
the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro 
the construction market includes general  electrical  plumbing  sheet metal  and road contractors 
other users of our products include farmers  truckers  railroads  mining companies  federal  state  and local governmental entities  schools  and certain retail trades 
geographically  our customers are primarily located in north america 
financial overview during and  the weakness of the global industrial environment negatively impacted our business 
during most of and all of  the strength of the global industrial environment positively impacted our performance 
the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years group reflects stores opened in and earlier and opened greater than five 
table of contents years group reflects stores opened in and earlier 
these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets 
the stores opened greater than two years group reflects stores opened in and earlier represent a consistent same store view of our business 
the net sales growth rate for each of the groups was as follows store age opened greater than years opened greater than years opened greater than years net sales net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows net sales percentage change the   and net sales growth rate percentages reflect a weakening economy since late versus a strengthening economy from summer to late in the north american market 
the increase in net sales in   and came primarily from unit sales growth in existing stores opened more than two years  growth in our newer product lines  and new store openings 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales and approximately  or to net sales 
the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years  and  as stated earlier  the sales of older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 
monthly daily sales growth our business had daily sales growth rates compared to the comparable month in the preceding year as follows month january february march april may june july august september october november december note daily sales are defined as the sales for a period divided by the number of business days in a period 
the strong growth in generally represents a continuation of the strong environments experienced in and the growth in generally represents a weakening environment which began in late the final three months of continued in the same variable fashion as the previous nine months but showed consistent 
table of contents improvement from the third quarter daily sales growth rate of 
generally speaking  this improvement in late remained in the first nine months of and weakened in the october to december time frame 
the third and fourth quarters of were influenced by variations in the number of business days versus this was most pronounced in september which had business days versus in september this had a dampening effect on september s daily average sales growth as some of our customer s purchases are based more on monthly budgets rather than daily consumption 
the slow down in the final three months of the year resulted from the general economic weakness in the global marketplace 
we believe the improvement in the final months of  and the first nine months of  and our performance in the final months of relative to the marketplace in which we operate  were driven  in part  by our pathway to profit initiative described later 
sales by product line the following table indicates  by product line  the year of introduction and the percentage of net sales 
type introduced fasteners tools cutting tools hydraulics pneumatics material handling janitorial supplies electrical supplies welding supplies safety supplies metals direct ship other fastener product line represents fasteners and miscellaneous supplies 
threaded fasteners accounted for approximately of the fastener product line sales in   and and approximately of consolidated net sales in   and direct ship represents a cross section of products from the ten product lines 
the items included here represent certain items with historically low margins which are shipped direct from our suppliers to our customers 
impact of fuel prices rising fuel prices negatively impacted and  however  we did feel some relief in the final months of during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately million  million  million  and million per month  respectively 
during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately million  million  million  and million per month  respectively 
the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs  the freight initiative discussed below  increases in product sales  and the increase in the number of vehicles necessary to support additional sales personnel and to support additional store locations 
these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semi tractors  straight trucks  and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately between distribution and store use 
in  we introduced our new freight model as a means to continue to improve our operating performance 
the freight model represents a focused effort to haul a higher percentage of our products utilizing the fastenal trucking network which operates at a substantial savings to external service providers because of our ability to leverage our existing routes and to charge freight more consistently in our various operating units 

table of contents this initiative positively impacted the latter two thirds of  all of  all of  and all of despite the changes in average per gallon fuel costs shown in the following table quarter quarter st nd rd th st nd rd th diesel fuel gasoline the average price of a gallon of diesel fuel and a gallon of gasoline decreased by and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of given the nature of our distribution business  fluctuations in fuel prices can have a meaningful impact on our results 
this impact is also covered later in our discussion about gross margin and operating and administrative expenses 
gross profit margins gross profit as a percent of net sales was as follows gross profit margins for increased over and the improvement was driven by several factors a focused effort to challenge our sales force to increase the gross margin on business with a lower than acceptable margin  a focused effort to stay ahead of inflationary increases in product cost  improvements in our direct sourcing operations  continued focus on our freight initiative discussed earlier  and continued focus on our product availability 
this product availability focus centers on our master stocking hubs in indianapolis  indiana and modesto  california  and our efficient ability to move product from store to store 
due to the benefit of item above  the rising fuel costs discussed earlier had only a nominal negative impact on our gross margin early in the first quarter of and this reversed to a positive gross margin impact from late in the first quarter into the second  third  and fourth quarters 
gross profit margins for increased over the improvement was driven by our freight initiative discussed earlier and by improvements in our direct sourcing operations 
these improvements were partially offset by the rising diesel fuel cost discussed earlier 
operating and administrative expenses operating and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were as follows operating and administrative expenses in grew over while this rate of growth was greater than our sales growth of  it represents the slowest rate of growth we have achieved in recent history 
the growth was primarily driven by payroll and related costs  which expanded due to headcount growth and increased incentive due to our gross margin improvement  transportation costs  which expanded due to rising fuel costs  and our legal settlement described earlier in this form k 
as the economy dramatically weakened in october  we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth in subsequent quarters if our sales growth were to continue to weaken 
we were pleased with our ability to reign in expenses during the fourth quarter of given the increase in personnel and store locations compared to the fourth quarter of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of grew over the fourth quarter of 
table of contents operating and administrative expenses grew at a rate faster than the net sales growth rate in this growth was primarily due to increases in occupancy and transportation expenses  our stock option expense  and  to a lesser extent  the initiatives most notably the csp conversions mentioned elsewhere in this form k 
the operating and administrative expenses for include  of additional compensation expense related to the adoption of new stock option accounting rules in early during  this expense was  we granted options to purchase  shares in and an additional  shares in april these options vest over a five to eight year period 
the two option grants  when combined  will result in compensation expense of approximately per month for the next four years  and dropping slightly in the remaining period 
no other stock options were outstanding during or operating and administrative expenses grew at a rate faster than the net sales growth rate in this was primarily due to the initiatives most notably the csp conversions mentioned elsewhere in this form k and their impact on employee numbers throughout the organization during  the impact of rising fuel costs for the first eight months of the year  and increases in occupancy costs 
in addition  the loss of a business day for the year  which occurred in the third quarter  negatively impacted our ability to leverage operating and administrative expenses 
payroll related costs payroll and related costs represented approximately   and of operating and administrative expenses in   and  respectively 
our net payroll cost for increased approximately over our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of increased approximately over the fourth quarter of the disparity between the full time equivalent headcount growth in the fourth quarter of and the expense growth is driven by contractions in the incentive commissions and bonuses earned during the final quarter of our sales personnel including our branch managers  district managers  and regional leaders are rewarded for growth in sales  gross profit dollars  and pre tax earnings 
the contraction in the growth rates of these amounts during the fourth quarter  when compared to the growth rates in previous quarters of  drove the contraction in the growth of incentive commissions and bonuses 
in  payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales due to increased incentive plan payouts resulting primarily from increased gross profit dollars for the year 
in  payroll and related costs increased at a rate which was less than the rate of increase in net sales 
in  payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales growth primarily due to the impact of the additional employees from our csp conversions  and from our master hub initiative 
effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively 
this tight management was significant  given our store expansion discussed elsewhere and given our acceleration in the addition of outside sales personnel at existing stores discussed elsewhere 
the following sets forth the average number of employees numbers are presented on a full time equivalent basis for each of   and store personnel distribution and manufacturing personnel administrative and sales support personnel total change the rate of increase in store personnel in was faster than the sales growth rate due to the additional personnel added as part of our pathway to profit initiative discussed elsewhere 
the rate of increase in distribution and manufacturing and administrative and sales support personnel in and was slower than the sales growth rate due to the tight management of headcount growth since early when we first introduced our pathway to profit initiative discussed elsewhere in this report 

table of contents we were pleased with our organization s ability to manage payroll and related costs in   and  while also contributing an annual profit sharing amount of approximately   and  respectively  to our employees k plan accounts or registered retirement savings plan rrsp in the case of our canadian employees 
occupancy costs occupancy costs represented approximately   and of operating expenses in   and  respectively 
in  we were able to leverage our occupancy costs for the first time since earlier in the decade 
occupancy expenses grew approximately from to and from to this improving trend was driven by the completion of our standard stocking model formerly referred to as csp store conversion during and due to the decrease in the rate of store openings pursuant to our pathway to profit initiative 
occupancy costs in   and increased due to a   and increase in the number of store locations in   and  respectively  the upgrade of store locations in connection with the store upgrade initiative formerly referred to as csp  and the relocation of existing stores 
during   and  we relocated approximately   and of our stores  respectively 
transportation costs transportation costs represented approximately   and of operating expenses in   and  respectively 
one component of operating and administrative expenses that experienced meaningful de leverage in was transportation cost 
our transportation costs grew approximately from to and from to this increase was primarily driven by the increase in fuel costs discussed earlier and by the increase in the number of vehicles needed to support an expanded sales force 
gain loss on sale of property  plant  and equipment the loss on sale of property and equipment for and came primarily from the sale of used vehicles 
the number was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our dallas  texas distribution center 
net earnings net earnings  net earnings per share eps  growth rates in net earnings  and growth rates in eps  were as follows dollar amounts net earnings basic eps diluted eps percentage change net earnings basic eps diluted eps during the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses 
during the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned impact of payroll and related costs and the improvements in gross profit margins 
during the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the impact of the improvements in gross profit margins 
the eps growth rate was greater than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in all three years 

table of contents working capital two components of working capital  accounts receivable and inventories  are highlighted below 
the annual dollar increase and the annual rate of growth were as follows dollar growth accounts receivable inventories annual growth rate accounts receivable inventories these two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital 
these initiatives include the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management this facility became operational early in and the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory  new expanded inventory  inventory necessary for upcoming store openings  or inventory necessary for our master stocking hubs 
the accounts receivable increase of from december  to december  resulted from daily sales growth of and in november and december  respectively 
the inventory increase from december  to december  of was less than our annual sales growth of  however  it was higher than we expected 
a portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends  therefore  the drop in sales growth activity during the last two to three months of the year resulted in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product 
we reduced our ordering patterns on products with a longer lead time midway through the quarter to match current sales trends 
as we indicated in earlier communications  our short term goals center on our ability to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ar i to better than a ratio on december  and we had a ratio of and  respectively 
pathway to profit during april we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business 
for most of the last decade  we have used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business opening approximately new stores each year 
under our pathway to profit initiative  we are adding outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns 
we intend to fund this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of to per year we opened approximately   and new stores in   and  respectively 
our goal is four fold to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model  to grow the sales of our average store from thousand per month spring to thousand per month five years or  to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow  and to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average store size increases 

table of contents in implementing the pathway to profit  we have increased our year over year store count and full time equivalent fte head count at the end of each of the respective periods as follows december september june march december store count growth store personnel fte distribution and manufacturing personnel fte administrative and sales support personnel fte total fte headcount growth store size and profitability the store groups listed in the table below  excluding our strategic account stores  represented approximately and of our sales in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
strategic account stores  which numbered and in the fourth quarter of and  respectively  are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market 
our remaining sales approximately related to either our strategic account stores  our in plant locations  our direct fastenal cold heading business  or our direct import business 
our average store  excluding the business not sold through a store  had sales of  per month in the fourth quarter of this average was  per month in the fourth quarter of the average age  number of stores and pre tax margin data by store size for the fourth quarter of and  respectively  were as follows three months ended december  sales per month average age years number of stores percentage of stores pre tax margin percentage to   to   to   to  over  strategic accounts total three months ended december  sales per month average age years number of stores percentage of stores pre tax margin percentage to   to   to   to  over  strategic accounts total as we indicated in april  our goal during the five year period from to is to increase the sales of our average store to approximately  per month by this will shift the store mix emphasis from the first three categories to   to  and  to  to the last three categories  to   to  and over  and we believe this will allow us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity 

table of contents note dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars  not thousands 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows dollars of net earnings the and increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above 
the percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december store distribution center total new stores open with the standard store model  which consists of a core stocking level of approximately thousand per location 
this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows dollars of net earnings property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows dollars of net earnings the increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures 
this was primarily due to the expansion of our indianapolis  indiana master distribution center  the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis  indiana and the relocation of our dallas  texas distribution center 
the decrease in investing activities is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures and the impact of approximately  due to sales of marketable securities in the amount was also impacted by the purchase of a building and the equipment for our new distribution center in modesto  california

we have expanded the number of owned store locations over the last several years and expect to purchase additional locations in the future 
as of december   we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 
we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations  from available cash and cash equivalents  and  to a lesser degree  from our borrowing capacity

effects of inflation price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in   and critical accounting policies our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible 
the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers 
inventory reserve this reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage 
the reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends 
the analysis includes inventory levels  sales information  physical inventory counts  cycle count adjustments  and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
health insurance reserve this reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims 
the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
general insurance reserve this reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation  property and casualty losses  and other self insured losses 
the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
tax strategies our effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail 
these reserves are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

under this interpretation  if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  we recognize the benefit 
we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
we regularly monitor our tax positions and fin no 
tax liabilities 
we 
table of contents reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit  or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit  when i there is a completion of a tax audit  ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance  or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 
significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities  positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 
geographic information information regarding our revenues and long lived assets by geographic area is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this form k under the heading certain risks and uncertainties and item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at december  commodity steel pricing we buy and sell various types of steel products which consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners 
during the last decade  there has been nominal movement in overall product pricing  with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the far east markets that occurred in the late s 
this trend reversed to inflation in late and early as well as the later part of and all of fluctuations in pricing of certain commodities like steel can affect our cost structure and pricing 
we are exposed to the impact of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 
commodity fuel prices we have market risk for changes in gasoline and diesel fuel  however  this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight cost to our customers and the efficiency of our trucking distribution network
