table of contents overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that applies proprietary technologies to research  develop and in the case of our dyloject tm product injectable diclofenac  commercialize new products and improved formulations of existing drugs that target current unmet and underserved medical needs primarily in the acute care pain management market 
our product and product candidates are designed to offer enhanced pain relief  fewer adverse side effects and faster relief of acute pain compared to other currently available treatments 
we have three late stage product candidates in clinical development in the united states us dyloject diclofenac sodium injectable  ereska tm intranasal ketamine  formerly referred to as pmi and rylomine tm intranasal morphine 
on october   we received marketing authorization approval in the united kingdom uk for dyloject  our proprietary injectable formulation of diclofenac sodium mg ml 
commercial launch of the product occurred in december of upon first inclusion in local hospital formularies 
we began recording product revenues related to sales of dyloject in the uk in the first quarter of we have devoted substantially all of our resources since we began our operations in february to the development  and during with respect to dyloject the commercialization  of proprietary pharmaceutical products for the treatment of pain 
since our inception  we have incurred an accumulated net loss attributable to our common stockholders of approximately million through december   excluding approximately million of a deemed dividend  although million of this amount was related to a non cash charge we incurred for the issuance of common stock in connection with the acquisition of a license 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  including acquisition of technology rights  general and administrative expenses  and most recently  sales and marketing expenses related to the commercialization of dyloject in the uk research and development activities include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for our research  development and manufacturing employees  costs associated with nonclinical and clinical trials  process development and improvement  regulatory and filing fees  and clinical and commercial scale manufacturing 
selling  general and administrative costs include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for employees  temporary and consulting expenses  and costs associated with our pre and post launch selling and marketing activities in the uk on january   we entered into a license and commercialization agreement with therabel pharma nv therabel under which therabel was granted an exclusive license under certain of our technology to commercialize dyloject and will assume all dyloject commercialization  regulatory  and manufacturing responsibilities and expenses in the uk along with those for future market approvals in the european union eu and certain other countries outside of the us in february  we received an upfront payment of million from therabel  and will receive up to approximately an additional million in payments for the sale of our existing inventory of dyloject to therabel 
additionally  the agreement also provides for the potential of up to million in sales and regulatory milestone payments 
the agreement shall continue in full force and effect on a country by country basis as long as any product licensed under the agreement is being developed or commercialized for use in any disease  disorder  or condition in humans 
either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice upon the occurrence of certain events  including material breach or bankruptcy  subject to certain cure provisions and restrictions 
in addition  therabel may terminate the agreement following a specified period of prior written notice to us 
on september   we completed a merger with intrac  inc intrac  a nevada corporation  for the purpose of migrating the intrac corporate entity to delaware  at which time javelin pharmaceuticals  inc javelin continued the business conducted by intrac 
javelin was incorporated in july in the state of delaware by intrac 
on december   we completed a reverse merger transaction with innovative drug delivery systems  inc idds  whereby intrac merger sub  inc  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of intrac merged with and into idds  with idds as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of intrac 
in consideration for their shares of idds  the former stockholders of idds received approximately of the outstanding common stock of intrac 
following the merger  the executive officers and directors of idds became the executive officers and directors of intrac 
for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition with idds as the acquiror and intrac as the acquired party 
therefore  when we refer to our business and financial information relating to periods prior to the merger  we are referring to the business and financial information of idds 
the 
table of contents merger did not have any significant effects on our assets or liabilities or on our results of operations subsequent to the date of the merger 
since our inception  we have incurred approximately million of research and development costs 
the major research projects undertaken by us include the development of dyloject  ereska and rylomine 
total research and development costs incurred through december  for each of these products was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have incurred approximately million of research and development costs since inception that do not relate to our major research projects  and we incurred a charge of approximately million related to the merger of idds with pain management  inc and the related acquisition of a licensing agreement in for various reasons  many of which are outside our control  including timing and results of our clinical trials  requirements imposed by regulatory agencies  obtaining regulatory approval and our dependence on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred to commercialize our product candidates  nor is it possible to estimate when  if ever  any of our product candidates will be approved by regulatory agencies for commercial sale 
in addition  we may experience adverse results in the development of our product candidates  which could result in significant delays in obtaining approval to sell our product candidates  additional costs to be incurred to obtain regulatory approval or failure to obtain regulatory approval 
if any of our product candidates were to experience setbacks  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
even if we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates  failure of physicians and patients to accept our products as a safe  cost effective alternative compared to existing products would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
we have limited capital resources  significant net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expect these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future 
although we believe that our existing cash resources  in addition to those cash resources that we may receive pursuant to the therabel agreement discussed above  will be sufficient to support the current operating plan at least through december  we will need additional financing to support our operating plan thereafter or we will need to modify our operating plan accordingly 
we may raise additional funds through the private and or public sale of our equity and or debt securities 
we may also seek to raise capital through collaborative arrangements with corporate sources or other sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if at all available  can be obtained on terms reasonable to us 
if sufficient funds are not available  we will need to postpone or discontinue future planned operations and projects 
results of operations revenues 
product revenue 
in  we recorded product revenue of approximately million  which consists entirely of sales of dyloject in its first year of launch in the uk product revenues from dyloject in will not be significant for us  as we outlicensed our rights to the product in the uk and uk to therabel on january  however  we expect to record royalty revenues from therabel s sales of dyloject in the uk  the amounts of which will be dependent on therabel s ability to successfully market the product  obtain market acceptance  and file additional marketing applications for dyloject in the eu there can be no assurance that this will happen 
government grants and contracts 
prior to  all of our revenues since our inception were derived from government grants and contracts 
in october  we received a grant of million from the us department of defense dod for the development of ereska 
in may  the dod extended the award by million funding for the development of ereska 
we did not record any contract revenue for the years ended december  and  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  related to the dod contract 
the dod contract was billed monthly as costs were incurred 
costs and expenses costs of product revenues 
in  our cost of product revenues was approximately million  
table of contents resulting in gross margins of for the year 
the high cost of product revenues was due to the low yields and high per unit costs for production  shipping  labeling  packaging and sampling costs related to our current contract manufacturer and early supply chain deployment for a new product launch 
additionally  we incurred significant costs for new product sampling and testing prior to labeling and packaging related to dyloject 
these costs were immediately expensed to cost of goods sold in the period they occurred 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials and supplies used to develop and manufacture our product candidates 
other research and development expenses include compensation paid to consultants and outside service providers to run the clinical trials 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant research and development expenses in the future as our three product candidates proceed with pivotal clinical trials and progress through the later stages of product development towards commercialization 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and nature of clinical trial expenditures and regulatory filings 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses resulted from the advancement of our dyloject and ereska product candidate development programs 
research and development salaries  temporary labor  and benefits increased by approximately million as compared to the same period of the prior year 
expenses associated with clinical trials  including lab fees  increased by approximately million 
other consulting expenses related to our clinical and manufacturing activities increased by million compared to the same period of the prior year 
dyloject product development costs increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in december  dyloject successfully met primary efficacy endpoints with robust statistical significance in the second of two large pivotal us phase efficacy studies in postsurgical patients with moderate to severe pain 
in september  we completed enrollment in this study  which had begun in july this us study enrolled patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain following elective orthopedic surgery 
this was a arm design that employed dyloject and ketorolac doses  or placebo  in postoperative orthopedic surgical patients 
in september  we enrolled the first patient in a planned phase  single arm  open label observational safety study for dyloject 
the study is intended to supplement our summary of an integrated patient safety data base  as part of our new drug application nda for a planned submission to the fda in the single arm  open label design of this safety study allows more rapid enrollment and data monitoring than our two double blinded  pivotal phase efficacy studies 
ereska product development costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in june  we announced dosing of the first patient in our first pivotal phase clinical study of ereska for acute moderate to severe pain 
the trial enrolled approximately patients and is designed to confirm the analgesic efficacy of ereska in treating postoperative pain following orthopedic surgery 
the phase trial was completely enrolled as of november prior randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  phase clinical studies of ereska have demonstrated rapid  statistically significant relief of moderate to severe postoperative and breakthrough pain 
in february  we completed accrual of subjects in the last of four planned phase human pharmacokinetic pk studies needed to support our intended filing of an nda for ereska 
this group of four pk studies enrolled a total of subjects  of whom received ereska intranasally  received intravenous ketamine  and received oral ketamine 
some subjects received ketamine by more than one route of administration 
no serious adverse events occurred in any of the four trials 
rylomine product development costs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses resulted from the advancement of each of our three product candidate development programs 
research and development salaries  temporary labor  and benefits increased by approximately million as compared to the same period of the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of full time personnel 
table of contents and recording stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
expenses associated with clinical trials  including lab fees  increased by approximately million 
expenses associated with manufacturing and process development increased by million compared to the same period of the prior year 
milestone expenses were  for the year ended december  there were no milestone expenses for the year ended december  dyloject product development costs increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in july  we began the second of two pivotal us phase clinical studies for dyloject 
in december  dyloject successfully met primary and secondary analgesic efficacy endpoints in the first of two pivotal us phase studies 
in this us multi center study  postoperative lower abdominal surgery patients with moderate to severe pain were randomized to receive certain dosage levels of dyloject  ketorolac or placebo iv every six hours 
additionally  in january  we announced results of a new phase study of dyloject demonstrating minimal effects in vitro upon platelet function at a clinically effective dose 
in contrast  aspirin and ketorolac each impaired platelet aggregation significantly in this in vitro model 
ereska product development costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of three phase trials needed to complete the clinical portion of our nda filing for ereska 
rylomine product development costs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in june  rylomine successfully met its primary clinical endpoint  in this first of two pivotal phase studies  as patients with moderate to severe pain after elective orthopedic surgery had significantly better summary of pain intensity differences scores over hours than the corresponding placebo groups 
this study involved randomized patients with moderate to severe post surgical pain 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  stock based compensation and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  sales and marketing and human resource functions 
other costs include medical information services  monitoring  sales and marketing costs related to the launch of dyloject in the uk  including our contracted sales force  medical education and market research 
additionally  it includes facility costs and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease significantly in  primarily due to the outlicensing of dyloject in the uk to therabel in january  thereby eliminating our sales and marketing costs associated with dyloject in the u 
k and previously planned costs for the commercialization of the product in additional eu countries 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over resulted primarily from increased sales and marketing costs related to the launch of dyloject in the uk 
additional increases were due to facility costs  headcount and personnel costs as we expand and improve our administrative infrastructure  as well as general administrative and professional fees to support the launch 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million compared to  primarily due to costs related to a full year s expense for our contract sales force in the uk  as well as increased promotional  market research  and market education costs in related to the approval and commercial launch of dyloject in the uk additionally in  we recorded approximately million of amortization expense of our intangible assets related to commercial milestones to sales and marketing expenses 
further increases of million over were the result of salary  stock based compensation and bonus expense for our selling  general and administrative employees 
these increases were due primarily to compensation related to the addition of full time personnel  but were offset by lower overall bonus expenses 
legal  accounting  consulting and other third party service fees for increased by approximately million compared to  primarily related to increased legal fees for patents and consulting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended

for the year ended december  we had lower average invested balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities than in for the year ended december  we had higher average invested balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities than in impairment of auction rate securities 
due to adverse developments in the global credit and capital markets during  certain auctions for auction rate securities have failed as a result of liquidity issues and there is little to no current market activity for these instruments 
we performed a fair value analysis of the securities with the help of an independent third party valuation specialist  and determined the fair values of our auction rate securities were below carrying value  and recorded a charge to the results of operations to reflect the impairment in the amount of  litigation settlement 
in february  we settled litigation with west pharmaceutical services  inc west regarding west s assignment of certain license agreements to archimedes pharma limited archimedes as part of the sale of west s drug delivery business to archimedes 
under the terms of the settlement  on march  west paid us approximately  to resolve all claims and we exchanged mutual releases

we may raise additional funds through the private and or public sale of our equity and or debt securities 
we may need to raise additional funds to meet long term planned goals 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if at all available  can be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain such additional financing  future operations will need to be scaled back or discontinued

dod and nih revenue is recognized as subsidized project costs for each period are incurred 
contract and grant revenue is derived from internal headcount expense and external contractual expense  both of which are highly dependent on the timing  order and relationship of individual reimbursable subprojects 
our grant submissions may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of studies and clinical trials 
as of december   we had utilized all available contract and grant funding 
with the exception of revenues derived from government grants and contracts  and product revenues in from sales of dyloject in the uk  we have generated no operating revenues since our inception 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  and title and the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer 
our product revenue consists of sales of dyloject in the uk  which began in the first quarter of during  we sold product directly to hospitals upon approval from their formulary process at a price which has been approved by the uk national health services 
due to the nature of our pricing as approved by the uk national health services and the national healthcare process  our sales do not have any provisions for chargebacks  rebates  discounts or other adjustments to gross revenue recorded 
our return policy allows for returns based on subjective criteria of the buyer for a limited period of time after the product is delivered 
because we started recording sales in the first quarter of  we do not have a significant amount of history to draw upon in determining the level of returns that we might experience based on our return policy 
as such  we believe it is appropriate not to record revenue on those shipments occurring in the reporting period that could be returned in the following reporting period  and will recognize revenues on those shipments when the right of return restrictions lapse in the subsequent period 
marketable securities 
as of december   our marketable securities consist of student loan auction rate securities issued by a state agency and an auction rate security of a closed end mutual fund 
the closed end mutual fund primarily invests in common stocks  including dividend paying common stocks such as those issued by utilities  real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies under the internal revenue code 
the fund also invests in fixed income securities such as us government securities  preferred stocks and bonds 
due to adverse developments in the global credit and capital markets during  certain auctions have failed as a result of liquidity issues and there is little to no current market activity for these instruments 
as a result level and level pricing inputs are unavailable to support the fair value of these securities 
therefore  we have classified these securities as level at december  in the fourth quarter of  with the help of a third party valuation specialist  management determined that the fair value of these auction rate securities is impaired on an other than temporary basis 
this judgment was determined based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of each security 
this included a review of each security s collateral  ratings and insurance in order to assess default risk  credit spread risk and downgrade risk 
additionally  a risk assessment was prepared for each security based on the details of each security  as well as the influence of various credit risks and overall credit environment 
as a result of this analysis  we determined the fair value was below carrying value  and recorded a charge to the results of operations to reflect the impairment in the amount of  if the auction rate markets continue to deteriorate for these securities  additional impairments could be necessary 

table of contents inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
at december  and  our inventory consisted entirely of dyloject 
we make the decision to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products at the point we believe future economic benefit will be realized  generally upon regulatory approval 
our inventory is currently manufactured by a third party manufacturer in the us 
we do not capitalize inventory produced by the manufacturer until a batch is completed and released 
a batch is released after testing and acceptance of the batch as commercially viable 
at that point  we assume ownership and title to the inventory  and incur a liability 
we do not have economic responsibility for product that is not commercially viable 
our inventory is initially considered work in process  as it is considered brite stock until it is labeled and packaged 
inventory is considered finished goods upon successful labeling and packaging of the product 
inventory is relieved to cost of goods sold upon sale at actual cost of production 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets 
long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
included in the assessment of intangibles  significant weight was given to the patent life of the intangible 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
research and development costs 
since our inception  we have incurred approximately million of research and development costs 
the major research projects undertaken by us include the development of dyloject  ereska and rylomine 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred for which there is no alternative future use 
for various reasons  many of which are outside our control  including timing and results of our clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval and dependence on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred to commercialize our products  nor is it possible to estimate when  if ever  any of our products will be approved by regulatory agencies for commercial sale 
in addition  we may experience adverse results in the development of our products  which could result in significant delays in obtaining approval to sell our products  additional costs to be incurred to obtain regulatory approval or failure to obtain regulatory approval 
in the event any of our product candidates were to experience setbacks  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
even if we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our products  failure of physicians and patients to accept our products as a safe  cost effective alternative compared to existing products would have a material adverse effect on our business 
share based payments 
we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share based payment awards 
in connection with valuing stock options and warrants  we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of domestic net operating loss carryforwards which expire on various dates through these loss carryforwards are available to reduce future federal and state taxable income  if any 
these loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities 
we have incurred operating losses since inception and 
table of contents have established valuation allowances equal to the total deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty with respect to achieving profitable operations in the future 
should the uncertainty regarding our ability to achieve profitable operations change in the future  we would reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance  the effect of which could be material to our financial statements 
contingencies and litigation 
there has been  and we expect there may be  significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices  regulatory issues  pricing  and patents and other intellectual property rights 
certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements certain warrants issued in conjunction with our common stock financing are equity linked derivatives and accordingly represent an off balance sheet arrangement 
these warrants meet the scope exception in paragraph a of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas  but instead included as a component of equity 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated statement of stockholders equity for more information 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates 
such election  which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  is typically irrevocable once elected 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas effective january  and decided not to elect the fair value option for our existing financial assets and liabilities 
therefore  adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
amends and expands the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not currently expect this pronouncement to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is not permitted 
fsp fas also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives for intangible assets and should be applied to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to the effective date 
the impact of fsp fas will depend on the size and nature of acquisitions  if any  on or after january  in december  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
this issue is effective for us beginning january   and will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
while management has not yet completed its analysis  it does not anticipate that the implementation of eitf will be material to the consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in september the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurement 
sfas no 
also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which permits a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
with regard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january   except for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis for which delayed application is permitted until our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk related to interest rates and foreign currency we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relation to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of december   our cash included approximately million of money market securities  and million in auction rate marketable securities 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our operations are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
in  we had sales and marketing operations in the uk and  to a lesser extent  germany 
additionally  our product revenues were from the uk as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily british pound and euro 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the licensing of dyloject to therabel in january  we will have minimal transactions in foreign currency in therefore  the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
