our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
our company we are one of the world s largest and oldest lessors of intermodal containers and chassis 
intermodal containers are large  standardized steel boxes used to transport freight by ship  rail or truck 
because of the handling efficiencies they provide  intermodal containers are the primary means by which many goods and materials are shipped internationally 
chassis are used for the transportation of containers domestically 
we operate our business in one industry  intermodal transportation equipment  and have two business segments equipment leasing we own  lease and ultimately dispose of containers and chassis from our lease fleet  as well as manage leasing activities for containers owned by third parties 
equipment trading we purchase containers from shipping line customers  and other sellers of containers  and sell these containers to container traders and users of containers for storage  one way shipment or other uses 
operations our consolidated operations include the acquisition  leasing  re leasing and subsequent sale of multiple types of intermodal containers and chassis 
as of december   our total fleet consisted of  containers and chassis  including  containers under management for third parties  representing  twenty foot equivalent units teu 
we have an extensive global presence  offering leasing services through offices in countries and third party container depot facilities in countries as of december  our customers are among the world s largest shipping lines and include  among others  apl nol  cma cgm  nyk line  mediterranean shipping company and maersk line 
for the year ended december   our twenty largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenue  our five largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenues  and our largest customer accounted for of our leasing revenues 
we lease three principal types of equipment dry freight containers  which are used for general cargo such as manufactured component parts  consumer staples  electronics and apparel  refrigerated containers  which are used for perishable items such as fresh and frozen foods  and special containers  which are used for heavy and oversized cargo such as marble slabs  building products and machinery 
we also lease chassis  which are used for the transportation of containers domestically via rail and roads  and tank containers  which are used to transport bulk liquid products such as chemicals 
we also finance port equipment  which includes container cranes  reach stackers and other related equipment 
we believe that these additional equipment types represent natural extensions for our business 
as of december   dry  refrigerated and special containers represented approximately  and of our total fleet on a unit basis  respectively 
our chassis equipment  which was first purchased in the fourth quarter of  represented of our fleet on a unit basis as of december  our equipment trading fleet represents approximately of our total fleet 
for the fiscal year  dry  refrigerated and special containers represented approximately  and of our leasing revenues  respectively 
our chassis represented approximately of our leasing revenues during

long term leases  typically with initial contractual terms of three to eight years  provide us with stable cash flow and low transaction costs by requiring customers to maintain specific units on hire for the duration of the lease 
finance leases  which are typically structured as full payout leases  provide for a predictable recurring revenue stream with the lowest daily cost to the customer because customers are generally required to retain the equipment for the duration of its useful life 
service leases command a premium per diem rate in exchange for providing customers with a greater level of operational flexibility by allowing the pick up and drop off of units during the lease term 
we also have expired long term leases whose fixed terms have ended but for which the related units remain on hire and for which we continue to receive rental payments pursuant to the terms of the initial contract 
some leases have contractual terms that have features reflective of both long term and service leases 
we classify such leases as either long term or service leases  depending upon which features are more predominant 
as of december   approximately of our containers and chassis were on hire to customers  with approximately of our equipment on long term leases  approximately on finance leases  
table of contents approximately on service leases and approximately on long term leases whose fixed terms have expired 
in addition  approximately of our fleet was available for lease and approximately was available for sale 
the following table provides a summary of our lease portfolio  based on units in the total fleet as of the dates indicated below december  sept  june  march  december  december  lease portfolio long term leases finance leases service leases expired long term leases units on hire total leased used units available for lease new units not yet leased available for sale total fleet operating performance our profitability is primarily determined by the extent to which our leasing and other revenues exceed our ownership  operating and administrative expenses 
our profitability is also impacted by the gain or loss that we realize on the sale of our used equipment and the net sales margins on our equipment trading activities 
our profitability for the year ended december  was supported by the growth of our container fleet  increased utilization in all of our major product lines  exceptional gains on the sale of our used containers  and strong sales margins from our equipment trading activity 
additionally  we concluded several container portfolio sales for which we realized gains 
our leasing revenue is primarily driven by our owned fleet size  utilization and average rental rates 
our leasing revenue is also impacted by the mix of leases in our portfolio 
during  our owned container fleet increased on a teu basis to million owned teu 
as of december   our revenue earning assets leasing equipment  net investment in finance leases  and equipment held for sale totaled approximately billion  an increase of approximately million  or  over december  our revenue earning asset growth has been higher on a dollar basis than our fleet growth has been on a teu basis due to our large purchases of refrigerated containers  special containers and tank containers  which are more expensive than dry containers on a per teu basis 
in addition  the growth of our fleet has decreased the average age and increased the average net book value of the units in our owned fleet 
in  excluding equipment trading units purchased for resale  we purchased approximately  teu of new equipment for approximately million including a purchase lease back transaction with one of our largest customers in the fourth quarter of in this transaction  we purchased approximately  teu of in service equipment for approximately million and leased the equipment back to the customer on long term lease 
leasing demand for containers and the utilization of our fleet for most of was supported by continued worldwide containerized trade growth and reduced direct container purchases by our shipping line customers due to the high cost of new containers and the increased scarcity of capital 
looking forward  we expect that our purchases of new leasing equipment will decrease significantly in global containerized trade growth turned negative in the fourth quarter of  and our customers are projecting that trade volumes will be exceptionally weak in  especially for dry containers 
as a result  we expect new dry container purchases for shipping lines and leasing companies to be unusually low in however  we expect to continue to invest in new refrigerated and special containers as conditions warrant and 
table of contents we will seek further opportunities for purchase lease back transactions for containers currently in service with our shipping line customers 
in we sold approximately  teu of our older containers  excluding containers purchased for resale 
over the last three years  our disposal of older containers has averaged approximately  teu per year  which represents an average of approximately of our equipment leasing fleet at the beginning of each year 
this annual disposal rate is close to our theoretical steady state disposal rate given the year expected useful life of our containers 
however  based on the age profile of our existing fleet  scheduled lease expirations and the prospects for decreased leasing demand due to reduced trade growth  we expect our rate of disposals will increase in and remain elevated before decreasing several years thereafter 
a disproportionately large share of our containers were produced before since we invested in a relatively small number of containers from through we expect that we will sell most of the pre units over the next several years 
during years of above average disposals  our teu growth rate may be constrained if we are unable to generate a sufficient number of attractive lease transactions for an expanded level of new container purchases 
the following table sets forth our average equipment fleet utilization for the periods indicated below year ended quarter ended quarter ended quarter ended quarter ended average utilization december  december  september  june  march  utilization is computed by dividing our total units on lease by the total units in our fleet which includes leased units  new and used units available for lease and units available for sale 
the following tables set forth our ending fleet utilization for the dates indicated below ending utilization december  september  june  march  ending utilization excluding new units not yet leased december  september  june  march  utilization of our container fleet was relatively high throughout our average utilization decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   while utilization of our containers excluding off hire new units was fairly steady and quite strong throughout in the range of to 
utilization for our dry containers was supported during the first three quarters of by strong cargo growth  limited direct purchasing of new containers by our shipping line customers  a low volume of drop offs  enhanced logistical protections in our lease contracts  high prices for new containers and the strong used container sale market 
our utilization was also supported by the large percentage of our dry containers on long term lease and finance lease 
however  in the fourth quarter of  our utilization began to decrease  particularly for dry containers 
in the fourth quarter  global trade growth turned significantly negative causing our customers to significantly increase their rate of dry container drop offs and significantly reduced their rate of container pick ups 
our dry container utilization typically decreases in the fourth quarter due to the end of the summer peak season  but the decrease in the fourth quarter of was larger than usual 
we expect dry container off hires to remain high and dry container pick ups low  and expect utilization to continue to decrease as long as containerized trade growth remains unusually weak 

table of contents leasing demand for our refrigerated containers was relatively strong  though seasonal  in the utilization of our refrigerated containers does not heavily influence our overall utilization since they represent only approximately of the units in our fleet 
however  these container types are significantly more expensive than dry containers  generate higher per diem lease rates and currently represent approximately of our leasing revenue 
we achieved solid on hire and utilization growth early in the year during the winter peak season and late in the year at the start of the winter peak season 
demand during the typically slow summer season for refrigerated containers was light 
while we expect that demand for refrigerated containers will be negatively impacted by the global recession in  the impact on refrigerated containers has not yet been as severe as it has been for dry containers 
leasing demand and utilization for our special containers was strong throughout  while leasing demand for chassis was weak during most of the year due to the combination of chassis operating efficiency gains through a greater use of chassis pools and a slowdown in the growth of the asia to north america trade 
we expect the market conditions for chassis to remain weak in average lease rates for our dry container product line in stayed relatively flat compared to the average lease rates in we experienced an increase in dry container lease rates during the third and fourth quarters of  relative to the average levels during the same periods in new dry container prices rose during the first nine months of to a peak of  for a dry container  and then declined in the last three months of to under  due to decreasing steel prices in china 
while we do not expect to purchase large numbers of new dry containers during the first two quarters of  it is likely that our per diem rates will be negatively impacted by lower steel and new containers prices  a build up of idle shipping line and leasing company containers in asia  and aggressive leasing company competition due to the sharp economic contraction and the decrease in trade volumes the market has been experiencing since november average lease rates for refrigerated containers in decreased by compared to  and declined slightly from the third to fourth quarters of market leasing rates for new refrigerated containers are still below our portfolio average rates 
average lease rates for special containers increased during compared to  reflecting increased prices for special containers and strong leasing demand 
during the third quarter of  we concluded the sale of several small container portfolios 
the containers included in these portfolio sales were generally younger containers on long term leases with our shipping lines customers  and we will continue to be involved with and receive fees for collections and other management services 
these portfolios sales were mainly undertaken to expand our network of third party container investors  diversify our funding sources and manage our customer concentrations 
we received total proceeds of million for the portfolio sales and recorded gains of approximately million 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million gain on the sale of our used containers compared to a million gain for the year ended december  the improvement compared to last year mainly resulted from higher selling prices for containers sold in  as well as an increase in sales volume 
for most of  selling prices for used containers were supported by high prices for new containers and high utilization of leasing company and shipping line containers 
high utilization of containers constrains the supply of used containers available for sale 
the average container sale age for tal increased to years in from years in and years in older units generally have a lower net book value and result in higher disposal gains since used container sale prices are not highly affected by the age of the container 
market conditions for used equipment sales in look substantially worse than they were in due to the recent decrease in new container prices and the rapid increase in the number of idle containers worldwide 
our used container selling prices and disposal gains could decrease significantly in if current market conditions persist 
during  we recognized a net sales margin of million on the sale of equipment purchased for resale compared to million of net sales margin for in  we sold higher volumes and achieved 
table of contents higher per unit selling margins 
unit sale margins in were helped by a steady increase in used container sale prices during the year 
it typically takes us two to three months to sell containers purchased for resale  and when used container sale prices are increasing  our selling margin is boosted by the increase in market prices during our holding period 
in addition  the strong sale market for used containers and the upward trend in used container selling prices allowed us to be aggressive in the volume of containers purchased for resale 
we expect the volume of containers purchased for resale to decrease in our ownership expenses  principally depreciation and interest expense increased by million  or for the year ended december   slightly less than the increase in the dollar value of our revenue earning assets over the same time 
our depreciation expense increased  substantially less than our revenue earning asset growth 
growth in depreciation expense has been less than our asset growth due to the increasing average sale age of our containers and the resulting increase in the portion of our containers that have become fully depreciated 
interest expense increased in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  interest expense increased more rapidly than our revenue earning assets due to higher average daily debt balances in versus resulting from large equipment payments in the latter half of and the first half of during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million of our series term notes and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of million  net of the write off of deferred financing costs of million 
our provision for doubtful accounts was million for the year ended december   up from million in the year ended december  the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts in primarily relates to a partial reserve of million against a finance lease for one of our customers 
we also recorded a million provision on the remaining leases in our finance lease portfolio 
most of our shipping line customers have reported significant decreases in profitability in the second half of  and many are expecting to incur losses in at least the first few quarters of at least eight small shipping lines ceased operation in  and we had exposure to two of these lines 
in general  we remain concerned that we may continue to see an increase in the number and size of customer defaults due to the deteriorating financial performances of our shipping line customers combined with the constrained capital markets that could make it difficult for our customers to finance any operating losses they may incur as well as their vessel orders and other expansion commitments 
we have not yet experienced a general deterioration of our customers lease payment performance  though we continue to actively review our portfolio to make sure we identify potential problem accounts as early as possible and we continue to be more selective in pursuing new business opportunities 
dividends we paid the following quarterly dividends during the years ended december  and on our issued and outstanding common stock record date payment date aggregate payment per share payment november  december  million august  september  million may  june  million march  april  million november  december  million august  august  million may  may  million february  march  million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of our leasing equipment  principal payments on finance lease receivables and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our cash in flows and borrowings are used to finance capital expenditures  meet debt service requirements  and pay dividends 
we continue to have sizable cash in flows 
for  cash provided by operating activities  together with the proceeds from the sale of our leasing equipment and principal payments on our finance leases  was approximately million 
in addition  as of december  we had approximately million of unrestricted cash 
as of december   major committed cash outflows in the next months include million of committed but unpaid capital expenditures and million of scheduled payments on our existing debt facilities 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities and existing cash  proceeds from the sale of our leasing equipment and principal payments on our finance lease receivables will be sufficient to meet our committed obligations over the next months 
however  our ability to make future capital expenditures and implement our current growth plans will also be dependent on our ability to increase our lending commitments  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we continue to seek additional sources of financing to fund our growth plans  though disruptions in the capital markets have become more severe  and this may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to secure additional financing commitments 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient additional financing we deem suitable  we will not be able to invest in our fleet at our target level and our future growth rate and profitability will decrease

we economically hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our long term borrowings by entering into interest rate swap contracts 
debt covenants we are subject to certain financial covenants under our debt facilities 
at december   we were in compliance with all such covenants

non gaap measures we rely primarily on our results measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in evaluating our business 
ebit  cash interest  tnw  and indebtedness are non gaap financial measures used to determine our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt agreements and should not be used as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
however  we believe that the inclusion of this non gaap information provides additional information to investors regarding our debt covenant compliance 
minimum ebit to cash interest expense for the purpose of this covenant  ebit is calculated based on the cumulative sum of our earnings for the last four quarters excluding income taxes  interest expense  amortization write off of deferred financing charges  unrealized gain or loss on interest rate swaps and non cash compensation 
cash interest expense is calculated based on interest expense adjusted to exclude interest income  amortization of deferred financing costs  and the difference between current and prior period interest expense accruals

failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the related credit agreements and could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the creditors 
asset backed securitization term notes our asset backed securitization program was the primary funding source used to finance our existing container fleet and new container purchases from the program s inception in april of through the conversion of the term note series to a term loan in april the term note series issued in april were used to finance the majority of the containers in our fleet at that time  and the term notes series was primarily used to finance our new container purchases between april and april the term note series was initially structured to have a limit of million 
on august   we increased the facility from million to million 
on november   we increased the facility from million to million 
it was our original intention to issue term notes to refinance the containers funded through the facility 
however  the market for asset backed term notes has been significantly disrupted  which has limited our ability to refinance the notes 
the facility automatically converted to a nine year amortizing term loan with a basis point increase to the interest margin as of april  during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million of our series term notes and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of million  net of the write off of deferred financing costs of million 
the borrowing capacity under the abs program is determined by applying the advance rate of against the net book values of designated eligible containers plus accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days plus restricted cash 
the net book value for purposes of calculating our borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to a range of to of original equipment cost depending on equipment type 
under the abs program  the borrower is required to maintain restricted cash balances on deposit in a designated bank account equal to five months of interest expense 
asset backed credit facility on march   we entered into a million asset backed credit facility 
the facility initially had a month revolving credit period  commencing on the date of the facility  followed by a nine year term period in which the outstanding balance amortizes in equal monthly installments 
on june   the borrowing capacity was increased to million 
on september   the borrowing capacity was further increased to million and the revolving period was extended to june   on which date the facility will convert to a term facility and amortize in equal monthly installments through june the interest rate margin will increase by basis points when converted to a term facility

revolving credit facility on august   we entered into a revolving credit agreement which refinanced a predecessor facility  which was terminated in accordance with its terms 
the initial commitment under the revolving credit facility was million  but in accordance with the terms of the facility stepped down to million on january   and million on march  the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is august  we are required to maintain unencumbered assets equivalent to of the maximum commitment 
finance lease facility on july   we entered into a million credit facility to support the growth of our finance lease business the finance lease facility 
the finance lease facility had a two year revolving period which preceded a ten year term in which the outstanding balance  as of the term conversion date  amortizes in monthly installments 
the finance lease facility is secured by the finance lease receivables associated with certain containers 
the finance lease facility has a final maturity of july the borrowing capacity under the finance lease facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the lesser of the original equipment cost or the net present value of the minimum lease payments discounted using the facility rate at the time of borrowing 
term loan facility on november   we entered into a three year term loan  which is secured by approximately  teu of previously managed dry and special containers that we purchased on october  the final maturity date of the loan is november  our initial borrowing under this facility of million was made on november  we made an additional borrowing under this facility of million on january  pursuant to a lender commitment dated december  the borrowing capacity under the term loan facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the net book values of designated eligible containers plus accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days 
the net book value for purposes of the borrowing base calculation is the equipment acquisition cost depreciated at an annual rate of 
port equipment facility on december   we entered into a euro denominated credit facility to support a port equipment financing transaction the port equipment facility 
the port equipment facility has an eight year term and amortizes in equal monthly installments 
capital lease obligations we have entered into a series of capital leases with various financial institutions to finance the purchase of chassis 
the lease agreements have been structured as ten year terminal rental adjustment clause trac leases with purchase options at the end of the lease terms equal to the trac amount as defined in each lease 
for income tax purposes  these leases are treated as operating leases 
in august and december  we entered into sale leaseback transactions for approximately  and  of containers for net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
the leases were accounted for as capital leases with interest expense recognized on a level yield basis over seven years  at which point there are early purchase options 
as the estimated fair value of the assets sold exceeded their carrying value  in the august transaction  the excess of the carrying value over the proceeds resulted in a loss of million  which was deferred and will be recognized over the estimated life of the leased assets

contractual obligations we are party to various operating leases and are obligated to make payments related to our long term borrowings 
we are also obligated under various commercial commitments  including obligations to our equipment manufacturers 
our equipment purchase obligations are in the form of conventional accounts payable  and are satisfied from cash flows from operating and or long term financing activities

off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize our critical accounting policies 
additional 
table of contents accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition operating leases with customers we enter into long term leases and service leases with ocean carriers  principally as lessor in operating leases  for marine cargo equipment 
long term leases provide our customers with specified equipment for a specified term 
our leasing revenues are based upon the number of equipment units leased  the applicable per diem rate and the length of the lease 
long term leases typically range for a period of three to eight years 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
advanced billings are deferred and recognized in the period earned 
service leases do not specify the exact number of equipment units to be leased or the term that each unit will remain on hire but allow the lessee to pick up and drop off units at various locations specified in the lease agreement 
under a service lease  rental revenue is based on the number of equipment units on hire for a given period 
revenue for customers where collection is not reasonably assured is deferred and recognized when the amounts are received 
in accordance with eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we recognize billings to customers for damages and certain other operating costs as leasing revenue as it is earned based on the terms of the contractual agreements with the customer 
as principal  we are responsible for fulfillment of the services  supplier selection and service specifications  and we have ultimate responsibility to pay the supplier for the services whether or not we collect the amount billed to the lessee 
finance leases with customers we enter into finance leases as lessor for some of the equipment in our fleet 
the net investment in finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
unearned income is recognized on a level yield basis over the lease term and is recorded as leasing revenue 
finance leases are usually long term in nature  typically ranging for a period of five to ten years and typically include a bargain purchase option that enables the lessee to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
equipment trading revenue and expense equipment trading revenue represents the proceeds from the sale of equipment purchased for resale and is recognized as units are sold and delivered to the customer 
the related expenses represent the cost of equipment sold as well as other selling costs that are recognized as incurred and are reflected as equipment trading expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
management fee income we manage equipment which is owned by third parties and we earn management fees based on the income earned by the leasing and sales of such equipment 
management fees are recognized as services are provided 
we collect amounts billed and pay operating costs as agent on behalf of the third parties that own such equipment 
these billings and operating costs are not included in revenue and expense  instead  the net amounts owed to these equipment owners are reflected as accrued expenses in our financial statements until paid as required by our contracts 
other revenues other revenues include fee income for third party positioning of equipment 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses are directly related to our equipment under and available for lease 
these expenses primarily consist of our costs to repair and maintain the equipment  to reposition the equipment  to store the equipment when it is not on lease  to inspect newly manufactured equipment and a provision for 
table of contents equipment lost or not expected to be returned 
these costs are recognized when incurred 
in limited situations  certain positioning costs may be capitalized 
leasing equipment in general  we purchase new equipment from equipment manufacturers for the purpose of leasing such equipment to our customers 
occasionally  we may also purchase used equipment with the intention of leasing such equipment 
used units are typically purchased with an existing lease in place or were previously owned by one of our third party owner investors 
leasing equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life 
we will continue to review our depreciation policies on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in our depreciation policies  useful lives of our equipment or the assigned residual values is warranted 
if indicators of impairment are present  a determination is made as to whether the carrying value of our fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
leasing equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recovered 
key indicators of impairment on leasing equipment include  among other factors  a sustained decrease in operating profitability  a sustained decrease in utilization  or indications of technological obsolescence 
when testing for impairment  leasing equipment is generally grouped by equipment type  and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities 
some of the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine future undiscounted cash flows and the measurement for impairment are the remaining useful life  expected utilization  expected future lease rates  and expected disposal prices of the equipment 
we consider the assumptions on expected utilization and the remaining useful life to have the greatest impact on our estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
these estimates are principally based on historical experience and management s judgment of market conditions 
estimated useful lives and residual values have been principally determined based on our historical disposal experience 
the estimated useful lives and residual values for our leasing equipment from the date of manufacture are currently as follows useful lives years residual values dry container units to refrigerated container units  to  special container units to  tank container units chassis costs incurred to place new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
we charge to expense inspection costs on new equipment and repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets at the time the costs are incurred  and include these costs in direct operating expenses 
an allowance is provided through direct operating expenses based on the net book value of a percentage of the units on lease to certain customers that are considered to be non performing which we believe we will not ultimately recover 
the percentage is developed based on our historical experience 
equipment held for sale when leasing equipment is returned off lease  we make a determination of whether to repair and re lease the equipment or sell the equipment 
at the time we determine that equipment will be sold  we reclassify the appropriate amounts previously recorded as leasing equipment to equipment held for sale 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 equipment held for sale is 
table of contents carried at the lower of its estimated fair value  based on current transactions  less costs to sell  or carrying value  depreciation on such assets is halted and disposals generally occur within days 
subsequent changes to the asset s fair value  either increases or decreases  are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the equipment held for sale  however  any such adjustments may not exceed the equipment s carrying value at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
initial write downs of assets held for sale are recorded as an impairment charge and are included in net gain loss on sale of leasing equipment 
realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of equipment held for sale are recorded as a gain loss on sale of leasing equipment  and cash flows associated with the disposal of equipment held for sale are classified as cash flows from investing activities 
equipment held for resale trading activity on an opportunistic basis  we purchase used equipment with markings or specifications different from our own equipment for purposes of reselling it within a short time frame for a net profit 
equipment purchased for resale is reported as equipment held for sale due to the short timeframe  generally less than one year  between the time the equipment is purchased and the time the equipment is sold 
due to this short expected holding period  cash flows associated with equipment held for resale are classified as operating cash flows 
equipment trading revenue represents the proceeds from the sale of this equipment  while equipment trading expense includes the cost of equipment sold and any costs to sell such equipment  including administrative costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is updated on a regular basis and is based upon a review of the collectibility of our receivables 
this review considers the risk profile of the customer  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions 
an account is considered past due when a payment has not been received in accordance with the contractual terms 
accounts are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collection of the full principal balance is in doubt 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in our receivables  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our existing receivables 
however  actual losses could exceed the amounts provided for in certain periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between our financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we adopted fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective january  goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded million of goodwill 
management determined that the company has two reporting units  equipment leasing and equipment trading  and allocated million and million  respectively  to each reporting unit 
the annual impairment test is conducted by comparing the company s carrying amount  to the fair value of the company using a market capitalization approach 
market capitalization of the entity is compared to the carrying value of the entity since virtually all of the goodwill is allocated to  and nearly all of the market capitalization is attributable to  
table of contents the equipment leasing reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the entity exceeds its market capitalization  then a second step would be performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
any excess fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
our annual review of goodwill  conducted in the fourth quarter of  indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
sfas is effective beginning in the first quarter of we will adopt sfas on january  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas r and sfas are effective beginning in the first quarter of early adoption is not permitted 
implementation of sfas r is prospective 
we will adopt sfas r and sfas on january  and believe that the adoption of these accounting standards will not have an impact on our current consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
 which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the statement s objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and elected not to fair value our existing financial assets and liabilities  and as a result  there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under sfas no 
 there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the new standard makes the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improves disclosures about those measures 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january   and there was no material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative diclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 

table of contents interest rate risk we enter into interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rates on a portion of our debt 
we assess and manage the external and internal risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with our overall operating goals 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk and legal risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of our policy 
the primary external risk of our interest rate swap contracts is counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
all derivative agreements are with major money center financial institutions rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies  with our counterparties rated a or better 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
both current exposures and potential exposures are calculated for each derivative contract to monitor counterparty credit exposure 
as of december   we had in place interest rate swap contracts to fix the floating interest rates on a portion of the borrowings under our debt facilities as summarized below weighted average fixed leg total notional amount at interest rate at weighted average december  december  remaining term  million years changes in the fair value on these interest rate swap contracts will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps 
since approximately of our debt is hedged using interest rate swaps  our interest expense is not significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
however  our earnings are impacted by changes in interest rate swap valuations which cause gains or losses to be recorded 
during the year ended december   unrealized losses on interest rate swaps totaled million  compared to unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of million for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have significant foreign based operations  the us dollar is the operating currency for the large majority of our leases and company obligations  and most of our revenues and expenses in and were denominated in us dollars 
however we pay our non us staff in local currencies  and our direct operating expenses and disposal transactions for our older containers are often structured in foreign currencies 
we recorded million of unrealized foreign currency exchange losses in the year ended december  and million of unrealized foreign currency exchange gains in the year ended december   which resulted primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates related to our euro and pound sterling transactions and related assets 
in april  we entered into a foreign currency rate swap agreement to exchange euros for us dollars based on expected payments under its euro denominated finance lease receivables 
the foreign currency rate swap agreement expires in april the fair value of this derivative contract was approximately million at december   and is reported as an asset in fair value of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet
