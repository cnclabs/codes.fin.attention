the comparable store sales performance was affected by numerous challenges including a difficult macro economic environment  declining consumer confidence resulting in lower than anticipated customer traffic and particularly cautious consumer spending and merchandise offerings that failed  at times  to meet customer expectations  resulting in substantial markdowns and lower realized average unit retails 
the company s current strategy is to target a general overall trend to return to comparable store sales growth  although it recognizes that it continues to be affected by many of these factors

the second major phase currently anticipates an initial roll out and utilization in mid fiscal and subsequently in early fiscal the third major phase contemplates ongoing enhancements and optimization of the new erp across all three brands  as well as the deployment of additional functionality across various other functions within the company 
the company expects that the costs associated with the implementation of the erp system will be funded from the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances 
given the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances and the capacity included in its bank credit facility  the company does not believe that it would need to seek other sources of financing to conduct its operations or pursue its expansion plans even if cash flow from operations should prove to be less than anticipated or if there should arise a need for additional letter of credit capacity due to establishing new and expanded sources of supply  or if the company were to increase the number of new stores planned to be opened in future periods

amounts due under non cancelable purchase commitments consists of amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase inventory that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including commercial letters of credit outstanding 
until formal resolutions are reached between the company and the relevant taxing authorities  the company is unable to estimate a final determination related to its uncertain tax positions and therefore is not including these amounts in the above table 
on november   chico s fas  inc entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility the credit facility with suntrust bank  as administrative agent the agent and lender and suntrust robinson humphrey  inc as lead arranger 
the credit facility replaces the company s previous million credit facility with bank of america

the credit facility also contains a feature that provides the company the ability  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  to increase the commitments available under the credit facility from million up to million through additional syndication 
the proceeds of any borrowings under the credit facility may be used to fund future permitted acquisitions  to provide for working capital and to be used for other general corporate purposes 
at january  and february   the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships of the type which certain other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer product returns  inventories  income taxes  insurance reserves  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventory valuation and shrinkage the company identifies potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with the company s overall growth rate 
excess quantities are identified through evaluation of inventory ageing  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in current business trends 
the company provides lower of cost or market reserves for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
the company estimates its expected shrinkage of inventories between physical inventory counts by applying historical chain wide average shrinkage experience rates 
the historical rates are updated on a regular basis to reflect the most recent physical inventory shrinkage experience 
revenue recognition although the company s recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the company 
retail sales by company stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons 
direct to consumer retail sales are recorded when shipments are made to customers and are net of estimated customer returns 
under the company s current program  gift certificate and gift card sales do not have expiration dates 
the company accounts for gift certificates and gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift certificate or gift card is sold 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for gift certificates and gift cards upon redemption 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue on unredeemed gift certificates and gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift certificate or gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift certificates or gift cards to relevant jurisdictions commonly referred to as gift card breakage 
the company recognizes gift card breakage under the redemptive recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on the company s historical gift card breakage rate 
the company determines the gift card breakage rate based on its historical redemption patterns 
once the breakage rate is determined  it is recognized over a month period based on historical redemption patterns of gift certificates and gift cards 
the company s policy is to honor customer returns in most instances 
returns after days of the original purchase  or returns without the original receipt  qualify for store credit only 
the company will  in certain circumstances  offer full customer refunds either after days or without a receipt 
the company estimates its reserve for customer returns based on the average refund experience in relation to sales for the related period 
evaluation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of the company s reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
the company evaluates its other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 

table of contents self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  medical and general liability claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using historical experience 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately accrue for estimated losses related to claims  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from recorded self insurance liabilities 
operating leases the company accounts for store rent expense in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases 
accordingly  rent expense under store operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
landlord incentives  rent free periods  rent escalation clauses and other rental expenses are also amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  which includes the construction period and which is generally days prior to the store opening date when the company generally begins improvements in preparation of intended use 
tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit within deferred liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease  which includes the construction period and one renewal when there is a significant economic penalty associated with non renewal 
income taxes effective february   the company adopted the provisions of fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement element for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
due to the substantial amounts involved and judgment necessary  the company deems this policy could be critical to its financial statements 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations adjust over time 
the company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
consequently  changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized related to income tax uncertainties and may affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the impact of the company s adoption of fin accounting for contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to various proceedings  lawsuits  disputes and claims actions arising from its normal business activities 
many of these actions raise complex  factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 
accounting for contingencies arising from these actions requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual  if any  related to such contingencies 
management may also consult with outside legal counsel to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of such actions could be different than management s estimate  and adjustments may be required 
stock based compensation expense effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal for share based awards includes a compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgments 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on 
table of contents the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current and prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk of the company s financial instruments as of january  has not significantly changed since february  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and its marketable securities 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to its revolving line of credit with its bank  however  as of january   the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its line of credit and  given its current liquidity position  does not expect to utilize its line of credit in the foreseeable future except for its continuing use of the letter of credit facility portion thereof 
the company s investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company s investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer

although the variable rate municipal debt securities have long term nominal maturity dates ranging from to  the interest rates are reset either daily  every days or every days 
despite the long term nature of the underlying securities of the variable rate demand notes  the company has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities based on various put features supplemented by standby purchase agreements or by the ability to draw down against irrevocable letters of credit issued by various financial institutions thereby creating a short term instrument 
the municipal bond portion of the portfolio have average maturity dates approximating days

conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million
