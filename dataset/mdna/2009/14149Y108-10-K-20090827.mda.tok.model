reportable segments fiscal and changes to reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june   the company reported financial information in three reportable segments healthcare supply chain services  clinical and medical products  and all other 
as discussed below under changes to reportable segments for fiscal  effective july   the company changed its 
table of contents reportable segments to three segments pharmaceutical  medical and carefusion 
effective upon the spin off  the company will change its reportable segments to two segments pharmaceutical and medical 
the following business discussion is based on the three reportable segments as they were structured for the fiscal year ended june  healthcare supply chain services pharmaceutical supply chain business

the pharmaceutical supply chain business also referred to as the pharmaceutical distribution business is one of the country s leading full service wholesale distributors to retail customers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers  hospitals and alternate care providers including mail order pharmacies located throughout the united states 
as a full service wholesale distributor  the pharmaceutical supply chain business complements its distribution activities by offering a broad range of support services to assist its customers in maintaining and helping to improve the efficiency and quality of their services

the company s proprietary software systems feature customized databases specially designed to help its pharmaceutical supply chain customers order more efficiently  contain costs and monitor their purchases 
in addition  the pharmaceutical supply chain business provides services to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers  including distribution services  inventory management services  data reporting services  new product launch support and contract and chargeback administration services 
the pharmaceutical supply chain business also operates a pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution program that provides repackaged pharmaceutical products to its customers 
nuclear pharmacy services business and other pharmaceutical supply chain businesses 
through its nuclear pharmacy services business  the healthcare supply chain services segment also operates centralized nuclear pharmacies that prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics 
the healthcare supply chain services segment also provides third party logistics support services  distributes therapeutic plasma to hospitals  clinics and other providers located in the united states and manufactures and markets generic pharmaceutical products for sale to hospitals  clinics and pharmacies in the united kingdom

com and supply chain management 
the medical supply chain business also assembles and distributes sterile and non sterile procedure kits under the presource brand name 

table of contents pharmaceutical supply chain business model 
the healthcare supply chain services segment s pharmaceutical supply chain business maintains prime vendor relationships with its customers that streamline the purchasing process for its customers by reducing the number of vendors 
using a prime vendor offers customers logistical savings and fosters partnerships between customer and distributor that result in greater efficiency and lower costs 
five primary factors influence the pharmaceutical supply chain business gross margin for pharmaceutical products customer discounts  manufacturer cash discounts  distribution service agreement fees  manufacturer rebates and incentives  and pharmaceutical price appreciation 
in general  the company sells branded pharmaceutical products to its customers at a contract price that is based on the manufacturer s published price or another designated price at the time of sale in either case  the manufacturer s designated price 
the contract price generally is determined by applying a discount to the manufacturer s designated price 
the term customer discounts refers to the difference in dollars between the sales price to customers for pharmaceutical products net of discounts  rebates and incentives given to customers and the manufacturer s designated price for those pharmaceutical products sold in a particular period 
the term manufacturer cash discounts refers to the aggregate amount in dollars of cash incentives the company receives from manufacturers for prompt payment of invoices 
manufacturer cash discounts are typically a fixed percentage of the purchase price from the manufacturer 
the term distribution service agreement fees refers to aggregate fees paid by manufacturers for services provided by the company related to the distribution of the manufacturers products 
the company s fee for service arrangements are reflected in written distribution service agreements  and may provide for a fee or a fee plus pharmaceutical price appreciation as described below 
in certain instances  the company must achieve certain performance criteria to receive the maximum fees under the agreement 
the fee is typically a fixed percentage of either the company s purchases from the manufacturer or the company s sales of the manufacturer s products to its customers 
the term pharmaceutical price appreciation refers to the impact on gross margin in dollars of pharmaceutical price appreciation for pharmaceutical products sold during a particular period 
the impact happens when the company purchases inventory and the manufacturer subsequently increases its published price 
by virtue of the company s contract price to customers being based upon the manufacturer s designated price at the time of the sale  the company then sells that inventory on hand at a higher price 
the company continues to generate a portion of its gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees 
for these manufacturers  a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases  as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to the company  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the term manufacturer rebates and incentives refers to discounts the company receives from manufacturers as a result of competition among manufacturers  including manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals  in pricing their products 
manufacturer rebates and incentives are based on either the company s purchases from the manufacturer or the company s sales of the manufacturer s products to its customers 
the company generally earns the greatest margin dollars on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product in the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary 
therefore  the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business generates gross margin primarily to the extent that the selling price to its customers  net of customer discounts  exceeds in the aggregate  the cost of products sold  net of manufacturer cash discounts  distribution service agreement fees  pharmaceutical price appreciation and manufacturer rebates and incentives 

table of contents with respect to its customers  the pharmaceutical supply chain business differentiates between bulk and non bulk customers  because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by non bulk customers 
bulk customers consist of customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses 
all other customers are classified as non bulk customers for example  retail stores  hospitals and alternate care sites 
bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as non bulk customers

these risks are not the only risks that the company faces 
the company s business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to it or that the company currently considers not to be material to its operations 
competitive pressures could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company operates in markets that are highly competitive 
its pharmaceutical supply chain business competes with two national  full line wholesale distributors  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  and a number of regional wholesale distributors  self warehousing retail pharmacy chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors  generic pharmaceutical telemarketing distributors and third party logistics companies  among others 
the company s medical products distribution business encounters competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of their businesses 
as a result  the company s businesses face continued pricing pressure from their customers 
in some cases  the company is able to offset revenue reductions caused by these pricing pressures by lowering its costs through effective product sourcing and cost controls 
if the company is unable to effectively mitigate future pricing pressures  its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  in recent years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation 
if this consolidation trend continues among the company s customers and vendors  it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power  which may adversely impact the company s gross margin 

table of contents substantial defaults or a material reduction in purchases of the company s products by large customers could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in recent years  a significant portion of the company s revenue growth has been derived from a limited number of large customers 
the company s largest customers  cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenue for fiscal the aggregate of the company s five largest customers  including cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal in addition  cvs and walgreens accounted for and  respectively  of the company s gross trade receivable balance at june  as a result  the company s sales and credit concentration is significant 
any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from these or other large customers could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  certain of the company s businesses have entered into agreements with gpos 
approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal was derived from gpo members through the contractual arrangements established with novation and premier 
generally  compliance by gpo members with gpo vendor selections is voluntary 
still  the loss of an agreement with a gpo could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition because the company could lose customers or may need to reduce prices as a result 
the company may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes 
the company anticipates that the current administration  congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access 
public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future 
the uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation may have an adverse effect on the company s customers purchasing decisions regarding its products and services 
at this time  the company cannot predict which  if any  healthcare reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on the company 
changes in the us healthcare environment could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s products and services are primarily intended to function within the current structure of the healthcare industry in the united states 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs 
these changes include increased use of managed care  cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels  consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply distributors and medical product manufacturers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  the consolidation of healthcare providers and pharmacy chains  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
the company expects the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes  such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services  legislation or regulatory requirements relating to matters including privacy of patient information  or changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals  medical devices  healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of the company s products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for such products and services 
changes in the healthcare industry s or in any of the company s suppliers pricing  reimbursement  selling  inventory  distribution or supply policies or practices  or regulatory and quality requirements  or changes in the company s customer mix  could also significantly reduce the company s revenue  increase the company s costs or otherwise significantly affect its results of operations 
generic pharmaceuticals 
the use of generic pharmaceuticals has increased over the past several years  and healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the use of generic pharmaceuticals will continue to increase over 
table of contents the next few years as a result of efforts to lower the overall cost of healthcare and the expiration of certain pharmaceutical patents 
a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing of or reimbursements for generic pharmaceuticals could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
prescription drug pedigree tracking 
various government agencies  including state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies  have increased efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply chain in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit  diverted  adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the supply chain 
to date  states have adopted some form of pedigree tracking requirements  of which currently require prescription drug pedigrees in certain situations 
these laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business  and could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
see item business regulatory matters above for more information regarding prescription drug pedigree tracking 
deficit reduction act of the dra changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from of the published price for generic pharmaceuticals to of the amp and requires manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals 
recently enacted legislation has delayed the implementation of these changes until october  the company expects the use of an amp benchmark to result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to its customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals  which may indirectly impact the prices that the company can charge its customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in the company s gross margin 
there can be no assurance that the changes in the reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra will not have an adverse effect on the company s business 
see item business regulatory matters above for more information regarding the dra 
the company s pharmaceutical supply chain business is subject to appreciation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices which subjects the company to risks and uncertainties 
the company continues to generate a portion of its gross margin from the sale of some manufacturers products from pharmaceutical price appreciation without receiving distribution service agreement fees 
for these manufacturers  a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases  as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to the company  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the pharmaceutical supply chain business distributes generic pharmaceuticals  which are generally subject to price deflation 
an increase in the rate and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical price deflation could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the company s tax positions could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company is a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions 
as such  the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal  state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions 
from time to time  various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the company s tax positions 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 
in addition  us federal  state and local  as well as international  tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
there can be no assurance that the company s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the company would be successful in any such challenge 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of notices of proposed adjustment 

table of contents risks generally associated with the company s information systems could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company relies on information systems in its business to obtain  rapidly process  analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers  receive  process and ship orders on a timely basis  manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  process payments to suppliers  and facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted  damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time  including due to the actions of third parties 
failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements  including dea operating and security standards  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated 
the company is subject to various local  state  federal  foreign and transnational laws and regulations  which include the operating and security standards of multiple federal  state and local agencies  the dea  the fda  the nrc  hhs  various state boards of pharmacy  state health departments and other comparable agencies 
certain of the company s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and or licenses with  and comply with operating and security standards of these agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution  manufacturing and sale 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits  licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits  licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of the company s businesses 
for example  in  the dea suspended the licenses to distribute controlled substances held by three of the company s distribution centers until the company reached a settlement to reinstate the licenses 
any noncompliance by the company with applicable laws and regulations or failure to maintain  renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the manufacture  distribution and marketing of certain of the company s products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda 
failure to comply with the requirements of the fda could result in warning letters  product recalls or seizures  monetary sanctions  injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products  civil or criminal sanctions  refusal by the government to grant approvals  restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of a consent decree for condemnation and permanent injunction between the company and the fda to resolve seizure litigation over alaris se pumps 
any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in the company and its products which could adversely affect the company s sales 
in addition  third parties may file claims against the company relating to these issues 
the company is also subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
many of these laws and regulations are vague or indefinite and may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the company to make changes in its operations 
if the company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could suffer civil and criminal penalties  including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
see item business regulatory matters above for more information regarding healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations 

table of contents disruptions in the financial market may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to the company 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments or refinance its obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on its operating and financial performance  which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors beyond its control 
the credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility that is difficult to predict 
disruptions in the financial markets  including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions  reduced lending activity  decreased liquidity and higher costs in the commercial paper market and reduced markets for securitizations  may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit that the company has already arranged  and the availability  terms and cost of credit in the future 
there can be no assurances that government initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to the company 
declining economic conditions could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the united states and other parts of the world could adversely impact the company s customers and vendors in a number of ways  which could adversely affect the company 
recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce  modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase the company s products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change terms of sales 
for example  certain hospitals delayed capital equipment purchase decisions during the second half of fiscal  which affected the financial results of the clinical and medical products segment during the period 
the company expects this delay will have an adverse impact on the financial results of carefusion through the middle of calendar year if customers cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to the company 
likewise  for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms 
any inability of current and or potential customers to pay the company for its products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company is involved in legal proceedings that could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company is involved in a number of legal proceedings  certain of which are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur 
it is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies 
generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products 
during the pendency of these legal challenges  a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product s patent 
to the extent the company distributes such generic products that are launched by the generic manufacturer at risk  the brand name company could assert infringement claims against the company 
while the company obtains indemnity rights from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products  there can be no assurances that these indemnity rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect the company 
in addition  certain of the company s products and services expose it to product and professional liability risks 
the availability of product liability insurance for large companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is generally more limited than insurance available to smaller companies and companies in other industries 
insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to large pharmaceutical and medical device 
table of contents companies generally limit the amount of available policy limits  require larger self insured retentions and include exclusions for certain products 
large self insured retentions may also apply to certain professional liability risks 
there can be no assurance that a successful product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the company s applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and  as such  these claims could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
circumstances associated with the company s acquisition and divestiture strategy could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
historically  an important element of the company s growth strategy has been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses that expand or complement the company s existing businesses 
acquisitions involve risks  including the risk that the company overpays for a business or is unable to realize in a timely manner  or at all  the synergies and other expected benefits from acquiring a business 
integrating acquired businesses also involves a number of special risks  including the following the possibility that management s attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations  unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and realizing potential revenue synergies and cost savings  problems assimilating and retaining the management or employees of the acquired company or the company s employees following an acquisition  accounting issues that could arise in connection with  or as a result of  the acquisition of the acquired company  including issues related to internal control over financial reporting  regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company or business  challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses  and potential adverse effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise 
if the company is unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner  its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
with respect to divestitures  the company continues to evaluate the performance and strategic fit of its businesses and may decide to sell a business or product line based on such an evaluation 
any divestitures may result in significant write offs  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner 
divestitures could involve additional risks  including the following difficulties in the separation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture  the disruption of the company s business  and the potential loss of key employees 
the company may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in divesting a business or product line 

table of contents the company s future results of operations are subject to the availability and fluctuations in the costs of purchased components  compounds  raw materials and energy 
the company depends on various components  compounds  raw materials and energy including radioisotopes  oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for its operations 
it is possible that any of the company s supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s manufacturing businesses use petroleum based materials as raw materials in many of their products 
prices of oil and gas also affect the company s distribution and transportation costs 
oil and gas prices are volatile and have increased in recent years  resulting in higher costs to the company to produce and distribute its products 
due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of the company s customers and third party payors  the company may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices 
if costs increase in the future and the company is unable fully to offset these increases through other cost reductions or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s global operations are subject to a number of economic  political and regulatory risks 
the company conducts its operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states  including countries in north america  south america  europe  the middle east  africa and asia 
global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as the company s in many ways 
the company s global operations are affected by local economic environments  including inflation  recession  currency volatility  and global competition 
political changes  some of which may be disruptive  can interfere with the company s supply chain and customers and all of its activities in a particular location 
while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some of these other risks may be insurable  such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful 
additionally  the company s global operations are also subject to risks arising from violations of us laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions  and various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations  including those which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and or with certain individuals identified by the us government 
if the company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could suffer civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with the spin off of carefusion 
the company s planned spin off of carefusion is subject to a number of risks  including the following risk of non consummation 
the company expects the distribution of or more of carefusion shares of common stock to occur after the close of trading on august  however  the spin off remains subject to conditions  including i the private letter ruling that the company received from the irs not being revoked or modified in any material respect  ii the receipt of opinions from counsel to the company to the effect that the contribution and distribution will qualify as a transaction that is described in sections a and a d of the code  iii no rating agency action that is likely to result in either the company or carefusion being downgraded below investment grade  and iv the making of a cash distribution from carefusion to the company prior to the distribution 
there can be no assurance that any or all of these conditions will be met and that the spin off will be completed in the manner and timeframe currently contemplated  or at all 

table of contents risks of not obtaining benefits from the spin off 
the company and carefusion may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the spin off  or may not achieve them in a timely fashion 
risks relating to less diversification 
if the spin off is completed  the company s operational and financial profile will change as a result of the separation of carefusion from the company s other businesses 
as a result  the company s diversification of revenue sources will diminish  and it is possible that the company s results of operations  cash flows  working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility 
the spin off could also be a factor causing or contributing to a determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower the credit rating of the company 
although the spin off will not trigger an acceleration of any of the company s indebtedness  a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies may eliminate or significantly diminish the company s ability to gain access to the commercial paper market  resulting in the need for the company to use alternative sources of credit at rates that may be higher than would otherwise be available to the company 
risks relating to taxes 
in connection with the spin off  the company received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that  among other things  the contribution by the company of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is tax free for us federal income tax purposes under sections and a d of the code 
in addition  it is a condition to the distribution that the company receive opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the spin off will qualify as a transaction that is described in sections a and a d of the code 
the ruling relies on  and the opinions will rely on  certain facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings from the company and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters 
if any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied  the company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities 
notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel  the irs could determine on audit that the spin off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling  or for other reasons  including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the company or carefusion after the spin off 
if the spin off is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes  the company and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 
the company s minority investment in carefusion is subject to certain risks and uncertainties and the company may not be able to capture the full benefits from this investment 
after the spin off  the company expects to retain no more than of the outstanding shares of carefusion common stock 
as with any investment in a publicly traded company  the company s investment in carefusion will be subject to certain risks and uncertainties relating to carefusion s business and ownership of carefusion common stock  which risks are disclosed in detail in carefusion s filings with the sec 
in addition  in connection with the spin off  the company agreed to vote all of the shares of carefusion common stock that it retains in proportion to the votes cast by carefusion s other stockholders  and in connection with that agreement  the company granted carefusion a proxy to vote the shares of carefusion common stock held by the company accordingly 
as a result  after the spin off  the company may be required to vote its shares of carefusion common stock in a manner that is contrary to the manner in which the company would otherwise have voted such shares 
in addition  even though the company will be carefusion s largest shareholder immediately after the spin off  the company will not have any representation on carefusion s board of directors 
pursuant to the private letter ruling received from the irs in connection with the spin off  the company will be required to dispose of its retained shares of carefusion common stock as soon as practicable after the 
table of contents spin off and consistent with the company s reasons for retaining such shares  but in no event later than five years after the spin off 
as a result  the company may be required to sell some or all of its retained shares of carefusion common stock at a time when it might not otherwise choose to do so 
furthermore  any such disposition by the company of its shares of carefusion common stock in the public market  or the perception that such dispositions could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for carefusion common stock and adversely affect the value or the terms and conditions of such disposition 
the company currently intends to dispose of its shares of carefusion common stock in an orderly fashion  but it is not obligated to do so

segment results of operations reportable segments during the first quarter of fiscal  the company reorganized its businesses into three reportable segments healthcare supply chain services  clinical and medical products and all other in order to reduce costs and align resources with the needs of each segment 
the healthcare supply chain services segment focuses on delivering best in class distribution and logistics services to its customers 
the segment generates approximately of the company s total segment revenue and approximately of the company s total segment profit as defined below in the segment results of operations section 
the clinical and medical products segment focuses largely on developing innovative products for hospitals and other providers of care 
the segment contributed approximately of the company s total segment profit 
the all other segment franchises and operates apothecary style retail pharmacies and provides pharmacy services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities 
all prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to this new financial reporting presentation 
the company evaluates the performance of the individual segments based upon  among other things  segment profit 
segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold  less segment sg a expenses 
segment sg a expense includes equity compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions  including corporate management  corporate finance  financial shared services  human resources  information technology  legal and legislative affairs and an integrated hospital sales organization 
information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the segment level

healthcare supply chain services segment performance fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  healthcare supply chain services revenue growth of billion or during fiscal was primarily due to additional volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation the combined impact of these two factors was billion 
the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was for the trailing twelve months ended june  revenue was also positively impacted by the addition of new customers million 
revenue growth was negatively impacted by the loss of customers million 
lost customer revenue from the dea license suspensions and the company s controlled substance anti diversion efforts also adversely affected revenue from non bulk customers 
the company resumed controlled substance distributions from distribution centers that were impacted by the license suspensions during the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents healthcare supply chain services segment profit increased million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
segment profit was positively impacted by an increase in gross margin of million and negatively impacted by a million increase in sg a 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation combined impact of million and increased manufacturer cash discounts million 
the increased distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts were primarily the result of increased sales volume 
gross margin was negatively impacted by increased customer discounts million as a result of sales growth  including faster growth of sales to bulk customers which tend to have larger customer discounts and customer repricings 
the company expects a certain level of continued pricing pressure due to the competitive market in which it operates 
sg a expenses for the twelve months ended june  increased slightly compared to prior year primarily due to increase in bad debt expense million based on the general economic conditions impacting certain customers and bankruptcy filings by four regional chain customers partially offset by disciplined cost controls 
the increase in segment profit during fiscal was also partially due to the impact of acquisitions million 
the company s results could be adversely affected if sales of pharmaceutical products decline  competitive pricing pressure intensifies  the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches decreases  generic price deflation increases  or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products decreases 
alternatively  the company s results could benefit if sales of pharmaceutical products increase  competitive pricing pressure subsides  the frequency of new generic pharmaceutical launches increases  generic price deflation decreases  or pharmaceutical price appreciation on branded products increases 
the company expects certain factors to negatively impact fiscal including the timing of generic launches and price deflation  the repricing of certain customer contracts and strategic positioning moves such as repositioning medicine shoppe and transitioning a significant vendor relationship to a distribution service agreement 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  healthcare supply chain services revenue growth of billion or during fiscal was primarily due to additional volume from existing customers and pharmaceutical price appreciation the combined impact of these two factors was billion 
the pharmaceutical price appreciation index was for the trailing twelve months ended june  revenue was also positively impacted by the addition of new customers million and the impact of foreign exchange million 
revenue growth was negatively impacted by the loss of customers billion and slower pharmaceutical market growth 
the dea license suspensions and the company s controlled substance anti diversion efforts resulted in non bulk customer losses and adversely affected the company s ability to acquire new non bulk customers 
healthcare supply chain services segment profit decreased million or during fiscal compared to the prior year as a result of a decrease of million in gross margin 
the decline in gross margin was primarily due to increased customer discounts million which resulted from the repricing of several large customer contracts and faster growth of sales to bulk customers which tend to have larger customer discounts 
also contributing to the decline in gross margin was a decline in sales to non bulk customers 
compared to fiscal  revenue growth in fiscal was lower and weighted more toward growth in revenue from bulk customers 
lost customer revenue from the dea license suspensions and the company s controlled substance anti diversion efforts also adversely affected gross margin during fiscal gross margin was also negatively impacted by decreased generic margin million primarily due to the impact of generic launches in the prior year which did not occur in the current year 
the company generally earns the greatest margin dollars on generic pharmaceuticals during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product to the marketplace because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally deflationary 
offsetting the negative impact on gross margins described above were higher distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation of million year over year due to increased sales volume and benefit from pharmaceutical price appreciation 
gross margin was also positively impacted during fiscal by increased 
table of contents manufacturer cash discounts million due to increased sales volume 
the growth of distribution service agreement fees  pharmaceutical price appreciation and manufacturer cash discounts was less than the growth in fiscal due to slower revenue growth 
increases in sg a expenses decreased segment profit by million during fiscal partially as a result of the impact of foreign exchange million 
bulk and non bulk customers 
the healthcare supply chain services segment differentiates between bulk and non bulk customers with respect to the distribution of pharmaceutical  radiopharmaceutical and over the counter healthcare products because bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than that generated by non bulk customers 
hereinafter all references to bulk and non bulk customers are confined to the product categories above 
bulk customers consist of retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses 
all other customers are classified as non bulk customers for example  retail stores  pharmacies  hospitals and alternate care sites 
bulk customers include the warehouse operations of retail chains whose retail stores are classified as non bulk customers 
a single retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a non bulk customer with respect to its retail stores 
bulk customers have the ability to process large quantities of products in central locations and self distribute these products to their individual retail stores or customers 
substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of product shipped in the same form as the product is received from the manufacturer  but a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping 
non bulk customers  on the other hand  require more complex servicing by the company 
these services  all of which are performed by the company  include receiving inventory in large or full case quantities and breaking it down into smaller quantities  warehousing the product for a longer period of time  picking individual products specific to a customer s order and delivering that smaller order to a customer location 
the company tracks revenue by bulk and non bulk customers in its financial systems 
an internal analysis has been prepared to estimate segment profit from bulk and non bulk customers by allocating segment expenses total of segment cost of products sold and segment sg a expenses separately for bulk and non bulk customers 
the following table shows the allocation of segment expenses  segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non bulk customers for fiscal  and prior period amounts differ from those previously disclosed as they have been updated to remove martindale which has been reclassified to discontinued operations in millions non bulk customers revenue from non bulk customers segment expenses allocated to non bulk customers segment profit from non bulk customers segment profit from non bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from non bulk customers bulk customers revenue from bulk customers segment expenses allocated to bulk customers segment profit from bulk customers segment profit from bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers amounts shown are estimates based upon the internal analysis described above 
the preparation of this internal analysis required the use of complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions  past experience and judgment that the company believes are reasonable 
the core pharmaceutical distribution operation distribution services both bulk and non bulk customers 
therefore  expenses associated with this operation were allocated between bulk and non bulk customers as 
table of contents described below 
the brokerage operation brokerage only services bulk customers  therefore  expenses associated with brokerage are allocated to bulk customers 
the remaining operations ie  excluding distribution service non bulk customers  therefore  expenses associated with these operations were allocated to non bulk customers 
the following describes the allocation of the major components of cost of products sold for distribution between bulk and non bulk customers cost of products sold for pharmaceutical products is determined by specifically tracking the manufacturer s designated price of products  at the time the products are sold  by bulk and non bulk customers 
the manufacturer s designated price is then reduced by other components impacting cost of products sold  including distribution service agreement fees  pharmaceutical price appreciation  manufacturer cash discounts and manufacturer rebates and incentives 
in addition  other inventory charges and credits are added or subtracted  as appropriate  to arrive at cost of products sold 
the company used the following methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the remaining components of cost of products sold between bulk and non bulk customers distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation are tracked by manufacturer 
therefore  the company allocated the distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation associated with each manufacturer among their products in proportion to sales of each product between bulk and non bulk customers 
manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold and were allocated in proportion to the manufacturer s published price of the product sold to bulk and non bulk customers 
manufacturers rebates and incentives are based on the individual agreements entered into with manufacturers related to specific products 
rebates and incentives were grouped by contract terms and then allocated in proportion to sales to bulk and non bulk customers 
other inventory charges and credits include charges for outdated and returned inventory items and fluctuation in inventory reserves 
the company estimated the portion of these inventory charges and credits attributable to each product and then allocated them to bulk and non bulk customers in proportion to the sales of these products 
the company used methods that it believes provide a reasonable correlation to allocate the sg a expenses for distribution between bulk and non bulk customers as follows warehouse expense includes labor related expenses associated with receiving  shipping and handling the inventory as well as warehouse storage costs including insurance  taxes  supplies and other facility costs 
warehouse expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoice line items filled for each bulk or non bulk customer because the company believes that there is a correlation between the number of different products ordered as reflected in invoice lines and the level of effort associated with receiving  shipping and handling that order bulk customers typically order substantially larger quantities of products and therefore generate substantially fewer invoice lines which results in substantially less warehouse expense being allocated to bulk customers  delivery expense includes transportation costs associated with physically moving the product from the warehouse to the customer s designated location 
delivery expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non bulk customer on the assumption that each invoice generates a delivery  sales expense includes personnel related costs associated with sales and customer service activities such activities are the same for both bulk and non bulk customers 
sales expense was allocated in proportion to the number of invoices generated for each bulk or non bulk customer because customer invoices are a reasonable estimate of the amount of customer service calls and sales effort  and 
table of contents general and administrative expenses were allocated in proportion to the units of products sold to bulk or non bulk customers 
these expenses were allocated on the assumption that general and administrative expenses increase or decrease in direct relation to the volume of sales 
the internal analysis indicated segment expenses as a percentage of revenue were higher for bulk customers than for non bulk customers because of lower pricing on sales for bulk customers and higher segment cost of products sold partially offset by lower segment sg a expenses 
bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than non bulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and the lower costs related to the services provided by the company 
in addition  sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to non bulk customers because bulk customers orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products 
the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by lower manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation and lower manufacturer cash discounts 
manufacturer distribution service agreement fees and manufacturer cash discounts are recognized as a reduction to segment cost of products sold and are lower as a percentage of revenue due to the mix of products sold 
pharmaceutical price appreciation increases customer pricing which  in turn  results in higher segment gross margin for sales of inventory that was on hand at the time of the manufacturer s price increase 
since products sold to bulk customers are generally held in inventory for a shorter time than products sold to non bulk customers  there is less opportunity to realize the benefit of pharmaceutical price appreciation 
consequently  segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is higher than for non bulk customers and segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue is substantially lower for bulk customers than for non bulk customers 
deliveries to bulk customers require substantially less services by the company than deliveries to non bulk customers 
as such  segment sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from non bulk customers 
however  the lower sg a expenses do not offset the higher cost of products sold and as a result  segment profit as a percentage of revenue is significantly lower for bulk customers than for non bulk customers 
the company defines bulk and non bulk customers based on the way in which the company operates its business and the services it performs for its customers 
the company is not aware of an industry standard regarding the definition of bulk customers and based solely on a review of the annual reports on form k of other national pharmaceutical wholesalers  the company notes that other companies in comparable businesses may  or may not  use a different definition of bulk customers 
during fiscal revenue from non bulk customers increased billion due to increased volume from existing customers 
segment profit from non bulk customers increased million during fiscal due to increased manufacturer cash discounts and an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation partially offset by an increase in customer discounts 
during fiscal revenue from bulk customers increased billion due to increased volume from existing customers and new customers 
segment profit from bulk customers decreased million during fiscal due to increased customer discounts partially offset by an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased manufacturer cash discounts related to sales volume growth 
during fiscal revenue from non bulk customers decreased million compared to the prior year due to the loss of customers  including the impact from the dea license suspensions and the company s controlled substance anti diversion efforts  partially offset by additional volume from existing customers 
segment profit from non bulk customers decreased million during fiscal compared to the prior year due to an increase in customer discounts and the impact of generic launches in the prior year which did not occur in the current year  coupled with greater generic deflation 
the decrease during fiscal was partially offset by an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation 
during fiscal revenue from bulk customers increased billion compared to the prior year due to new contracts signed with existing customers which resulted in increased volume from existing customers 

table of contents segment profit from bulk customers decreased million during fiscal compared to the prior year due to increased customer discounts as a result of customer repricings partially offset by increased manufacturer cash discounts related to sales volume growth 
the decrease during fiscal was also partially offset by an increase in distribution service agreement fees and pharmaceutical price appreciation 
clinical and medical products segment performance fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  during fiscal  clinical and medical products revenue and segment profit declined compared to the prior year 
the declines were primarily driven by the deferral in hospital customers capital spending and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the enturia acquisition 
additionally  segment profit was negatively impacted by product recalls and reserves and the alaris corrective action plan submitted to the fda  and a hold on shipping certain infusion products 
the company expects the deferral in hospital capital spending referenced above to have an adverse impact on carefusion results through the middle of calendar year the hold on shipping certain infusion products referenced above was lifted in july clinical and medical products segment revenue decreased million or during fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange million and decreased volume to existing customers primarily as a result of the ship hold million partially offset by the impact of acquisitions million 
clinical and medical products segment profit decreased million or during fiscal compared to the prior year period 
in addition to the factors described above  gross margin decreased segment profit by million primarily as a result of the revenue decline  the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange million and an increase in raw material cost million partly offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions million 
in addition  negatively impacting segment profit during fiscal were million in charges for product recalls and reserves and the corrective action plan submitted to the fda 
product recalls and reserves were also million for the fiscal sg a expenses remained relatively flat compared to the prior year primarily due to cost control initiatives offset by the impact of acquisitions million

revenue was also positively impacted by new products million  foreign exchange million  new customers million and increased volume from existing customers million 
clinical and medical products segment profit increased million or during fiscal gross margin increased segment profit by million primarily due to acquisitions million 
gross margin was also favorably impacted by a favorable mix of higher margin products combined impact of million  the impact of foreign exchange million and the correction of a prior year error million  as described below 
the year over year impact of alaris product corrective actions and recalls negatively impacted gross margin in fiscal by million 
increases in sg a expenses negatively impacted segment profit by million primarily due to acquisitions million and to a lesser degree the impact of foreign exchange million and increased investment in product quality and research and development costs million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company discovered it had failed to recognize a portion of profit on sales pertaining to prior years 
the error resulted from system interface and reconciliation discrepancies over a period of several years 
as a result  the company recorded income of approximately million in fiscal  of which million pertained to fiscal and million pertained to fiscal in connection with this matter  the company implemented an action plan that has addressed the issues related to the error

table of contents recent financial accounting standards see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 
critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company also provides financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from days to years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation 
these financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets 
extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company s management 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes portfolio and specific reserves  the company reviews accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength  credit standing  historical write off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable  assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
if the frequency or severity of customer defaults change due to changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts may require adjustment 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at june  and  respectively 
this allowance represented and of customer receivables at june  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue was  and at june   and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively  for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and sales type leases to the reserve at june  would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million 
reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic  business and market trends 
in addition  reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present 
the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed 
at this time  the company is not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 
see schedule ii included in this form k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 

table of contents inventories a substantial portion of inventories approximately and at june  and  respectively are stated at the lower of cost  using the lifo method  or market 
these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within the company s healthcare supply chain services segment distribution facilities and are primarily merchandise inventories 
the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year is dependent on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory 
prices for branded pharmaceuticals are primarily inflationary  which results in an increase in cost of products sold  whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals are deflationary  which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 
under the lifo method  it is assumed that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold 
as such  the company uses lifo to better match current costs and revenue 
therefore  reductions in the overall inventory levels resulting from declining branded pharmaceutical inventory levels generally will result in a decrease in future cost of products sold  as the remaining inventory will be held at a lower cost due to the inflationary environment 
conversely  reductions in the overall inventory levels created by declining generic pharmaceutical inventory levels would generally increase future cost of products sold  as the remaining inventory will be held at a higher cost due to the deflationary environment 
the company believes that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities 
as such  the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
in fiscal and  the company did not record any lifo reserve reductions 
the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
if the company had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities  inventories would not have changed in fiscal or fiscal in fact  primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories  inventories at lifo were million and million higher than the average cost value as of june  and  respectively 
however  the company s policy is not to record inventories in excess of its current market value 
inventories recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than the company s assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required  however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
business combinations assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which requires management to use significant judgment in determining fair value 
in addition  current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles  excluding goodwill 
the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
in conjunction with the review of a transaction  the status of the acquired company s research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of ipr d 
in connection with certain acquisitions  the company is required to estimate the fair value of acquired ipr d which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project 
management also assesses the current status of development  nature and timing of efforts to complete such development  uncertainties and other factors when 
table of contents estimating the fair value 
costs are not assigned to ipr d unless future development is probable 
once the fair value is determined  an asset is established  and in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  is immediately written off as a special item in the company s consolidated statements of earnings 
during fiscal  the company did not record any charges related to the write off of ipr d costs 
during fiscal  the company reversed million of a previously recorded write off of ipr d costs associated with viasys as a result of the finalization of the viasys purchase price allocation process and recorded charges of million and million related to the write off of ipr d costs associated with enturia and other minor acquisitions  respectively 
during fiscal  the company recorded charges of million and million related to the write off of ipr d costs associated with the acquisitions of viasys and care fusion  respectively see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
these statements provide guidance on the accounting and reporting for business combinations and minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
these statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  upon adoption in fiscal  these statements are expected to have a significant impact on the company s accounting and disclosure practices for future business combinations 
goodwill and other intangibles the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in conducting the impairment test  the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  further analysis is performed to assess impairment 
the company s determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and  if available  a review of the price earnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature  scope and size of the applicable reporting unit 
the methods and assumptions used to test impairment have been revised for any segment realignments for the periods presented 
the discount rates used for impairment testing are based on the risk free rate plus an adjustment for risk factors 
the ebitda multiples used for impairment testing are judgmentally selected based on factors such as the nature  scope and size of the applicable reporting unit 
the use of alternative estimates  peer groups or changes in the industry  or adjusting the discount rate  ebitda multiples or price earnings ratios used could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment 
any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to the company s results of operations 
the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal  and  which resulted in no impairment charges 
decreasing the price earnings ratio of competitors used for impairment testing by one point or increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing by would not have indicated impairment for any of the company s reporting units for fiscal or see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles 
special items the company records restructuring charges  acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items 
a restructuring activity is a program whereby the company fundamentally changes its 
table of contents operations such as closing facilities  moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product 
restructuring activities may also involve substantial re alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions 
restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred 
acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies 
upon acquisition  certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and other integration charges are recorded as special items as incurred 
the company recognizes income from the favorable outcome of legal settlements  judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters as special items on the consolidated financial statements when the associated cash or assets are received 
generally  expenses due to the unfavorable outcome of legal settlements  judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters litigation settlement losses are charged to the segment to which the matter relates and  as a result  are classified as sg a expenses on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in certain circumstances  significant litigation settlement losses are classified in special items on the consolidated statements of earnings 
factors considered in determining whether a particular litigation settlement loss should be classified in special items include the size of the settlement  the nature of the matter ie  significant matters that are infrequent  non recurring or unusual in nature are classified as special items  the age of the matter and the pervasiveness of the matter to the entire organization 
the company also classifies legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously disclosed sec investigation and related audit committee internal review and related matters as special items 
the majority of the special items related to acquisition integration and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employee related costs  exit costs including lease termination costs  asset impairments  ipr d costs  and other integration costs 
employee related costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility 
in addition  other facility exit costs include certain costs related to the spin off such as costs to evaluate and execute the transaction  costs to start up certain stand alone functions and information technology systems and other one time transaction related costs 
asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities 
ipr d costs include the write off of research and development projects in process at the time of acquisition  which had not yet reached technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use 
other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
vendor reserves the company maintains reserves to cover areas of exposure with its vendors 
in determining appropriate vendor reserves  the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims 
the company has established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review 
the company researches and resolves various types of contested transactions based on discussions with vendors  company policy and findings of research performed 
though the transaction types are relatively consistent  the company has periodically refined its estimate methodology over the past few years by updating the reserve estimate percentages based upon historical experiences 
changes to the estimate percentages have resulted in a financial impact to the company s cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 
vendor reserves were million and million at june  and  respectively 
approximately and of the vendor reserve at june  and  respectively  pertained to the healthcare supply chain services segment 
fluctuations in the reserve balance are caused by the variations of 
table of contents outstanding claims from period to period  timing of settlements and specific vendor issues  such as bankruptcies significant events would be described above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
though vendor transactions remain relatively consistent from period to period  unforeseen events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of a large vendor or a settlement of numerous outstanding claims could cause the reserve to fluctuate  and thus  have a financial impact on the period s financial results 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company s original estimate and may require adjustment 
the company believes  however  that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
self insurance accruals the company is self insured for employee medical and dental insurance programs 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis and current payment trends 
the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period 
this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented 
if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month  the impact on earnings would be million 
if the amount of claims  medical or dental costs increase beyond what was estimated  the reserve might not be sufficient and additional expense could be required 
the company believes  however  that the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
medical and dental insurance expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  the company has certain deductibles or is self insured for various risks including general liability  product liability  pharmacist professional liability  auto liability  property and workers compensation 
claims in excess of certain limits  however  are insured with commercial insurers 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to liability  property and workers compensation at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs  claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
for certain types of exposures the company develops the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim which is based on specific information related to each claim 
for claims incurred but not reported the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices 
the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters is dependent on future contingent events that cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from these estimates 
although the company believes that liability estimates are appropriate based on information available at june   it is possible  based on generally accepted actuarial analysis  that under adverse conditions the ultimate liability could exceed recorded expected liabilities as of june  by as much as million 
the insurance expense for general liability  product liability  pharmacist professional liability  auto liability  property and workers compensation was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company s income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the company 
table of contents had net deferred income tax assets of million and million at june  and  respectively 
the company also had net deferred income tax liabilities of billion and billion at june  and  respectively 
net deferred income tax assets included net federal  state and local  and international loss and credit carryforwards at june  and of million and million  respectively 
the company established a net valuation allowance of million and million at june  and  respectively  against certain deferred tax assets  which primarily relates to federal and state loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  the company anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard also provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognizing  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
if any of the company s assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase decrease in the company s effective tax rate by on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase decrease by million for the fiscal year ended june  loss contingencies the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible loss 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur  assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates 
equity based compensation the company accounts for equity based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  applying the modified prospective method 
this statement requires all equity based payments to employees  including grants of options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair values of options granted after the company adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model and all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a black scholes model 
the company s estimate of an option s fair value is dependent on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events 
these estimates which are entered within the option valuation model include  but are not limited to  stock price volatility  the expected option life  expected dividend yield and 
table of contents option forfeiture rates 
effective with all options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company estimates its future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on the company s common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant years 
the company analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates 
the company calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors 
once employee stock option values are determined  current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed  even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results 
sfas no 
r requires  however  the company to compare its estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding equity based compensation 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks 
these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange  interest rate  and commodity related changes 
the company maintains a comprehensive hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures 
it employs operational  economic  and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the company s use of derivative instruments 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity by nature of the company s global operations  it is exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation 
these exposures are transactional and translational in nature 
since the company manufactures and sells its products throughout the world  its foreign currency risk is diversified 
principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar  european euro  mexican peso  thai baht  british pound  and australian dollar 
transactional exposure the company s transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent or its subsidiaries 
as part of its risk management program  at the end of each fiscal year the company performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year 
the fiscal and fiscal analyses utilize a currency portfolio model  encompassing both implied volatility and historical correlation to estimate the net potential gain or loss 
these analyses included the estimated impact of its hedging program  which mitigates the company s transactional exposure 
at june  and  the company had hedged approximately and  respectively  of its transactional exposures 
the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to the company s transactional exposure in millions net estimated transactional exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss translational exposure the company also has exposure related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign divisions into us dollars  the functional currency of the parent 
it performs a similar analysis as described above related to this 
table of contents translational exposure 
the company does not typically hedge any of its translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in the company s analysis at june  and the following table summarizes the company s translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the us dollar in millions net estimated translational exposure sensitivity gain loss interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the company s policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management 
the company utilizes interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate movements 
as part of its risk management program  the company annually performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year 
this analysis assumes a hypothetical change in interest rates 
at june  and  the potential increase or decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was million and million  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity the company purchases certain commodities for use in its manufacturing processes  which include latex  heating oil  diesel fuel and polystyrene  among others 
the company typically purchases these commodities at market prices  and as a result  is affected by price fluctuations 
as part of its risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analysis on its forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year 
the company did not hedge any of these exposures at june  as of june   the company has hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the table below summarizes the company s analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical fluctuation in commodity prices as of june  and in millions estimated commodity exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss the company also has exposure to certain energy related commodities  including natural gas and electricity through its normal course of business 
these exposures result primarily from operating the company s distribution  manufacturing  and corporate facilities 
in certain deregulated markets  the company from time to time enters into long term purchase contracts to supply these items at a specific price
