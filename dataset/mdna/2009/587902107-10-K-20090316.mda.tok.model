the contraction is now assumed to last approximately through  but the actual depth and duration of the current downturn remains unknown 
for fixed maturity securities  yield and income generation remain the key drivers to our investment strategy and our overall philosophy is to invest with a long term horizon in high quality obligations 
we remain cautious with a bias toward higher quality securities that are well suited to withstand a soft economic cycle 
reliance on independent investment research to avoid potential difficulties will continue to be a key driver behind our investment decisions 
the continued elevation of fixed income spreads relative to historical levels may provide attractive investment opportunities  particularly in the corporate bond sector 
with all these risks present  we are cautious in the equities markets and will manage through this period by investing in companies with strong balance sheets and reasonable valuations
