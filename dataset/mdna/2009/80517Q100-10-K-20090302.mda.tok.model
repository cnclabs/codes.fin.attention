item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing pharmaceutical products that target unmet medical needs in both niche and broader specialty markets 
we are currently developing one product krystexxa pegloticase  formerly referred to as puricase  as a therapy for patients with treatment failure gout  or tfg  to control hyperuricemia and to manage the signs and symptoms of gout 
tfg is gout in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with conventional urate lowering therapy at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom conventional urate lowering therapy is contraindicated 
krystexxa is a biologic pegylated uricase enzyme being developed for tfg to control hyperuricemia and to manage signs and symptoms of gout  including the improvement of tophi  improvement in chronic pain  improved physical functioning and decreased frequency of flares 
in october  we completed the in life portion of our two replicate phase clinical trials of krystexxa and we are currently conducting an open label extension  or ole  study in patients who completed the phase clinical trials 
in october  we submitted a biologics licensing application  or bla  to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for krystexxa and in december  we were notified that the bla was accepted by the fda for priority review 
the fda notified us of the acceptance of the trade name krystexxa as the proprietary name for pegloticase in january also in january  we submitted to the fda  amendments to the krystexxa bla to further clarify the bla and to respond to fda review related questions 
the fda determined that the amendments to the bla constituted major amendments  and so the fda elected under applicable procedures to extend its review period by three months  establishing a revised target prescription drug user fee act action date  or pdufa date  for our bla submission of august  the fda also notified us that it intends to reschedule the arthritis advisory committee meeting that had been scheduled for march  to a later date 
our strategic plan is to advance the development and regulatory review of krystexxa and seek fda approval of the bla filing for the product 
we continue to evaluate potential worldwide collaborations or strategic transactions with third parties involving krystexxa in the united states and internationally in order to optimize shareholder value 
if we are unsuccessful in consummating a collaboration or broader strategic transaction  we would then independently pursue the commercialization of krystexxa in the united states 
currently  we sell and distribute branded and generic versions of oxandrolone  a drug used to promote weight gain following involuntary weight loss 
we distribute the branded version of oxandrolone in the united states under the name oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone through an agreement with watson pharma  inc  or watson 
we launched our authorized generic version of oxandrolone in december in response to the approval and launch of generic competition to oxandrin and currently have five competitors in the oxandrolone market 
our generic competitors are sandoz pharmaceuticals  upsher smith laboratories  par pharmaceuticals  roxane laboratories and kali laboratories 
we distribute the oxandrin brand product directly through wholesalers 
the introduction of oxandrin generics has led to significant decreases in demand for oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone product 
we believe that revenues from oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone product will continue to decrease 
we currently operate within one specialty pharmaceutical segment which includes sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone  and the research and development activities of krystexxa 
discontinued operations in august  we sold rosemont pharmaceuticals  ltd  or rosemont  our former united kingdom subsidiary that marketed more than oral liquid pharmaceuticals in the united kingdom  europe and part of asia  to ingleby limited  a close brothers private equity company  close brothers 
under the terms of the sale  close brothers paid us an aggregate purchase price of million for the issued share capital of rosemont s parent company and certain other related assets 
net proceeds from the transaction after selling costs and taxes were million 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million on the disposition of rosemont in in july  we sold bio technology general israel ltd  or btg  a biologics manufacturing business which primarily operated in israel  to ferring pharmaceuticals 
under the terms of the sale  ferring pharmaceuticals paid us an aggregate purchase price of million in cash and assumed specified liabilities related to the btg business 
we recorded a loss of  on the disposition of the btg business in revenue  operating income and income from discontinued operations  which consisted of the rosemont and btg businesses  for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december   we incurred a million tax assessment as a result of a tax audit for the through tax years that related to corporate income tax returns filed in israel by btg 
discontinued operations for includes tax refunds related to btg that we received from the israel taxing authorities and foreign currency exchange gains on these refunds 
the tax refund was due to an overpayment of estimated taxes in israel for the short tax year 
discontinued operations for include the results of the rosemont business up until its sale in august we did not have any revenues or operating income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and in  revenues from discontinued operations were million and operating income from discontinued operations was million 
the revenues and operating income were attributable to the rosemont business  which we sold in august loss from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  as a result of the tax audit assessment for btg 
income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  due to btg related israel tax refunds and foreign currency exchange gains on these refunds 
income from discontinued operations was million in  primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of the rosemont business  net of income taxes 
these results of discontinued operations are not included in the discussion below under results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies include management estimates that are most critical to our reported financial results product revenue recognition 
product sales relating to oxandrin are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale 
during  we began shipping our authorized generic version of oxandrolone product to our distributor and have accounted for the shipments on a consignment basis until the product is sold into the retail market 
we have deferred the recognition of revenue related to these shipments until we confirm that the product has been sold into the retail market and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 which we refer to together as sab  and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
sab states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
sfas no 
states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
our net product revenues represent total product revenues less allowances for returns  medicaid rebates  other government rebates  discounts  and distribution fees 
allowances for returns 
in general  we provide credit for product returns that are returned six months prior to or up to twelve months after the product expiration date 
our product sales in the united states primarily relate to the following products product expiration in years oxandrin and oxandrolone mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg delatestryl in  we determined  based on our review of stability data  that the oxandrin mg dosage form demonstrated stability over a three year shelf life and thus we modified the product s label to indicate a three year expiration date 
product with three year expiration dating was first sold to our customers in may in  we determined  based on our review of stability data that the oxandrin and oxandrolone mg dosage form demonstrated stability over a four year shelf life and thus we modified the product s label to indicate a four year expiration date 
oxandrolone product with four year expiration dating was first sold to our customers in august we first sold oxandrin product with four year expiration dating to our customers in september we completed the sale of delatestryl to indevus in january we continue to evaluate product returns on sales of delatestryl that occurred prior to the sale date to indevus 
upon sale  we estimate an allowance for future returns 
we provide additional reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known and knowable at the time of shipment 
in order to reasonably estimate future returns  we analyze both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates by lot productions  the level of product manufactured by us  the level of product in the distribution channel  expected shelf life of the product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand  and general economic and industry wide indicators 
certain specifics regarding these analyses are as follows actual return rates we track actual returns by product and analyze historical return trends 
we use these historical trends as part of our overall process of estimating future returns 
the level of product manufactured the level of product produced has an impact on the valuation of that product 
for production that exceeds anticipated future demand  a valuation adjustment will be required 
generally  this valuation adjustment occurs as an offset to gross inventory 
currently  we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the distribution channel 
level of product in the distribution channel we review wholesaler inventory and third party prescription data to ensure that the level of product in the distribution channel is at a reasonable level 
currently  the level of product in the distribution channel appears reasonable compared to industry norms for the mg dosage form of oxandrin and oxandrolone and the mg dosage form of oxandrolone 
the mg dosage form of oxandrin has higher levels of inventory in the distribution channel as compared to historical trends 
estimated shelf life product returns generally occur due to product expiration 
therefore  it is important for us to ensure that product sold into the distribution channel has excess dating that will allow the product to be sold through the distribution channel without nearing its expiration date 
currently we have mandated that product with less than twelve months of expiry dating will not be sold into the distribution channel 
we have taken the appropriate measures to enforce this policy  including setting up certain controls with our third party distributor 
in addition  we entered into a distributor service agreement with two of our largest wholesalers which limits the level of product at the wholesaler 
the terms of this agreement are consistent with the industry s movement toward a fee for service approach which we believe has resulted in better distribution channel inventory management  higher levels of distribution channel transparency  and more consistent buying and selling patterns 
because a majority of our sales flow through three large wholesalers  we expect that these industry changes will have a direct impact on our future sales to wholesalers  inventory management  product returns and estimation capabilities 
current and projected demand we analyze prescription demand data provided by industry standard third party sources 
this data is used to estimate the level of product in the distribution channel and to determine future sales trends 
product launches and new product introductions for future product launches  we will analyze projected product demand and production levels in order to estimate return and inventory reserve allowances 
new product introductions  including generics  will be monitored for market erosion and adjustments to return estimates will be made accordingly 
we also utilize the guidance provided in sfas no 
and sab in establishing our return estimates 
sfas no 
discusses potential factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including the susceptibility of the product to significant external factors  such as technological obsolescence or changes in demand  relatively long periods in which a particular product may be returned  absence of historical experience with similar types of sales of similar products  or inability to apply such experience because of changing circumstances  for example  changes in the selling enterprise s marketing policies or relationships with its customers  and absence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 
sab provides additional factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate including significant increases in or excess levels of inventory in a distribution channel  lack of visibility into or the inability to determine or observe the levels of inventory in a distribution channel and the current level of sales to end users  expected introductions of new products that may result in the technological obsolescence of and larger than expected returns of current products  the significance of a particular distributor to the registrant s or a reporting segment s business  sales and marketing  the newness of a product  the introduction of competitors products with superior technology or greater expected market acceptance  and other factors that affect market demand and changing trends in that demand for the registrant s products 
the aggregate net product return allowance reserve was million as of december   and million as of december  a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowance for product returns is as follows description balance at beginning of period expense provisions actual deductions other deductions balance at end of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales in thousands allowance for sales returns allowances for medicaid and other government rebates 
our contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply system commit us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the aggregate net rebate accrual balances were million as of december  and million as of december  a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowances for medicaid and other government rebates is as follows description balance at beginning of period expense provisions actual deductions other deductions balance at end of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales in thousands allowance for rebates inventory valuation 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on actual cost 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and the market value 
we determine these reserves based on estimates 
we continually analyze the impact of generic competition on our inventory reserves considering the oxandrin inventory currently on hand  inclusive of raw materials and finished goods  and the current demand forecasts 
the aggregate net inventory valuation reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
share based compensation 
we grant stock options to employees and non employee directors  which we refer to as directors  with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of our common stock on the date that the options are granted 
options granted have a term of ten years from the grant date 
options granted to employees vest over a four year period and options granted to directors vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period from the date of grant 
options to directors are granted on an annual basis and represent compensation for service performance on our board 
compensation cost for stock options is charged against income on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of all stock option awards as of the grant date by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost 
for the year ended december   we issued  shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and received proceeds of million 
for the years ended december   and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of stock option compensation expense has been charged against income 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unamortized stock option compensation which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
in addition  as future grants are made  we expect to incur additional compensation costs 
we grant restricted stock awards to some of our employees and to our directors 
restricted stock awards are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense  on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which ranges from one to four years in duration 
restricted stock awards to directors are granted on an annual basis and represent compensation for services performed on our board 
restricted stock awards to directors vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period from the grant date 
compensation cost for restricted stock awards is based on the grant date fair value of the award  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
for the year ended december   we issued  shares of restricted stock at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share amounting to million in total aggregate fair market value 
for the years ended december   and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred restricted stock compensation cost has been charged against income 
at december   approximately  shares remained unvested and there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock 
we issue restricted stock awards that contain performance conditions to senior management personnel 
these awards have the potential to vest over one to three years from the date of grant upon the achievement of specific strategic objectives associated with the achievement of krystexxa related developmental and sales milestones and other manufacturing  commercial operations and business development objectives 
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value of the award  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the date the award is approved multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
compensation expense is recorded over the implicit or explicit requisite service period based on management s best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest 
previously recognized compensation expense is fully reversed if performance targets are not satisfied 
during  we issued a restricted stock award to our former president and chief executive officer  the vesting of which was contingent upon the price of our common stock achieving a certain pre established stock price target 
we used a monte carlo simulation model to calculate both the grant date fair value and the derived requisite service period of the award 
based on the simulation  the grant date fair value of the award was per share and compensation cost was being charged against income ratably over a two year derived requisite service period 
for restricted stock awards that contain market conditions  compensation cost is charged against income regardless of whether the market condition is ever achieved and is reversed only if the derived requisite service period is not met by the recipient of the award 
as a result of the resignation of employment of our former president and chief executive officer in november  the derived requisite service period for this award was not met  and therefore  we reversed approximately million of compensation expense that was previously charged against income 
during the year ended december   we recorded income of approximately million related to restricted stock awards that contained performance or market conditions as a result of the reversal of the market based restricted stock award noted above 
during the years ended december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of compensation cost was charged against income related to restricted stock awards that contain performance or market conditions 
we have not granted any awards that contain both performance and market conditions 
at december   approximately  potential shares of restricted stock with performance conditions remain unvested 
restricted stock awards that contain performance conditions encompass performance targets set for senior management personnel through and could result in approximately million of additional compensation expense if the performance targets are met or expected to be attained 
during the year ended december  we cancelled approximately  potentially restricted shares that continued performance or market conditions due to objectives that were not attained 
research and development 
during the first quarter of  we adopted emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the eitf affirmed as a consensus  the tentative conclusion that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
consistent with the consensus  we have deferred approximately million of these costs as of december  and have amortized approximately million of these costs into expense for the year ended december  based on services performed 
the net deferred balance of million as of december  is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
all other research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred  including million and million of fees incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively  to reserve manufacturing capacity at our third party suppliers manufacturing facilities  for future potential orders of krystexxa 
income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we refer to as fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the consolidated balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted fin effective january  as a result of the implementation of fin in  we recorded a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including million of accrued interest and penalties  which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
this increase in liability resulted in a corresponding increase to accumulated deficit 
the total amount of federal  state  local and foreign liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december   including accrued penalties and interest 
the net increase of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits subsequent to adoption resulted in a corresponding decrease to the income tax benefit within our consolidated statements of operations as well as an increase to the deferred tax asset for which no tax benefit will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
disclosures about fair values of financial instruments  sfas no 
 defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the fair values of our financial instruments reflect the amounts that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
sfas no 
requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the statement of financial position  for which it is practicable to estimate fair value 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  notes receivable  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value of financial instruments 
other than temporary impairment losses on investments 
we regularly monitor our available for sale portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary  or ott  decreases in the fair value of investments 
management makes this determination through the consideration of various factors such as management s intent and ability to retain an investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
ott impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the investment 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million of realized investment losses due to ott declines in fair value  respectively 
results of operations our revenues for  and were derived primarily from oxandrin and oxandrolone 
our product revenues and expenses have in the past displayed  and may in the future continue to display  significant variations 
these variations may result from a variety of factors  including the timing and amount of product sales  changing demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  returns of expired product  changes in government or private payor reimbursement policies for our products  increased competition from new or existing products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and amount of expenses relating to manufacturing activities  and the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights 
our future revenues depend on our success in completing development and commercialization of krystexxa 
the commercial success of krystexxa will depend on many factors  including receiving  and the timing of  marketing approvals from the fda and similar foreign regulatory authorities  receiving fda and other foreign regulatory approvals of the third party manufacturing facilities used to produce the active pharmaceutical and other ingredients used in krystexxa  as well as for facilities used by our third party fill and finish provider  successful completion of our ole study and any other clinical trials we may undertake  producing batches of the active pharmaceutical and other ingredients used in krystexxa in commercial quantities through a validated process  maintaining and  as appropriate  entering into additional  commercial manufacturing arrangements for krystexxa  launching commercial sales of the product  whether alone or in collaboration with others  acceptance of krystexxa by physicians  patients  healthcare payors and others in the medical community  and our ability to raise substantial additional capital 
the following table summarizes net product sales of our commercialized products and their percentage of total net product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands oxandrin oxandrolone delatestryl in december  we launched our authorized generic of oxandrin  which is distributed through watson 
in january  we completed the sale of delatestryl to indevus 
our financial results have been dependent on sales of oxandrin since its launch in december generic competition for oxandrin began in december and the introduction of generic products has caused a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which has adversely affected us financially and has required us to scale back some of our business activities related to the product 
as a result  we anticipate that oxandrin will be a much less significant product for our future operating results 
during  and  we incurred substantial expenses relating to the clinical development of krystexxa 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses in  as we anticipate revenues from oxandrin and oxandrolone will remain flat or decrease  coupled with continued substantial expenses relating to the development and  if approved  the commercialization of krystexxa 
our expenses relating to the development and commercialization of krystexxa will depend on many factors  including the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in  from million in this decrease resulted primarily from lower product sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone 
we expect that sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone will continue to decline in future periods due to the continued impact of generic competition 
we recorded oxandrin negative net product sales of million for the year ended december   compared with million of net product sales for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower gross sales as a result of increased generic competition and an increase in our allowance for product returns due to higher actual historical rates of return for the product 
revenues from oxandrolone decreased million  to million in  from million in due to increased generic competition 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold remained unchanged at million in both and our cost of goods sold did not vary significantly from period to period 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was mainly due to a million increase in manufacturing related expenses for the completion of the first commercial batches of krystexxa and from the process validation and technology transfer to our secondary source supplier of krystexxa api 
the increase in expenses was also due to million in higher consulting  medical writing and data management services associated with the preparation of our bla filing for krystexxa  million in higher compensation expenses due to increased headcount and service based restricted stock awards  million from toxicology expenses and other clinical research studies for krystexxa and a million license milestone payment resulting from the filing of our bla in october partially offsetting these increases was an million decrease in clinical trial expenses as our phase clinical trials for krystexxa were completed in late if and when our bla for krystexxa is approved by the fda  we will no longer record manufacturing related costs for krystexxa as research and development expenses and will instead capitalize those costs as inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in legal expenses as a result of our patent infringement litigation with upsher smith laboratories  or upsher smith  and the settlement of a lawsuit with a former executive relating to his entitlement to severance payments and benefits upon termination of his employment 
additionally  marketing expenses for the preparation of the commercial launch of krystexxa increased by approximately million 
also contributing to the increase was approximately million in accrued severance expenses related to the separation agreement with our former president and chief executive officer 
partially offsetting the increases was the reversal of approximately million in stock based compensation expense that was previously charged against income related to a restricted stock award that contained a market condition for which the derived service period was not met  as a result of the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer 
also contributing to the offset was a decrease of approximately million in audit fees and million in decreased bonuses for senior executives 
investment income investment income decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was due to decreases in dividend and interest income driven by lower cash  cash equivalent and investment balances in addition to lower yields earned on these investments 
the decrease is also attributable to approximately million of realized losses resulting from redemptions and impairment write downs on our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio during income tax benefit the income tax benefit decreased million  to a benefit of million in  from a benefit of million in the income tax benefit reflects the expected tax effect of carrying back a portion of our net operating loss to our tax year to recover the remaining income tax liability that is eligible to be refunded for that tax year and the reversal of a deferred tax benefit related to a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit 
the decrease in the tax benefit from resulted from having significantly less taxes available to be refunded as a result of carrying back net operating losses than were available to be refunded as a result of carrying back net operating losses 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues from continuing operations decreased million  or to million in  from million in this decrease resulted primarily from lower product sales of oxandrin partially offset by revenues from our authorized generic version of oxandrolone  through our distribution agreement with watson 
sales of oxandrin decreased million  or  to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to generic competition to oxandrin  which began in december total prescription volume for oxandrin decreased by in from revenues from oxandrolone  increased by million  to million in  from million in oxandrolone revenues were nominal in  as we launched this product in december cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of oxandrin in as a result of generic competition 
additionally  the results included increased valuation reserves of million related to oxandrin inventory and a million accrued liability related to our future minimum purchase commitments for oxandrin raw material inventory  both resulting from the estimated impact of generic competition 
during  we entered into an agreement with our oxandrolone raw material supplier to reduce our future inventory purchase commitment obligation in lieu of a final contract amendment payment of million  a portion of which was related to inventory 
as a result of this agreement  we recorded a million adjustment  which reduced cost of goods sold in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was the result of phase clinical trials for krystexxa  which were completely enrolled in march and completed in october additionally  significant development work related to krystexxa manufacturing validation was completed in expenses related to krystexxa clinical trials increased by million from to  and krystexxa manufacturing and process development expenses increased by million from to in addition  we incurred approximately million of non refundable fees for the reservation of manufacturing capacity associated with potential future krystexxa orders pursuant to manufacturing agreements with our primary and secondary contract manufacturers 
we also recognized a million increase in stock based compensation expense in  including performance based stock awards where performance objectives were either achieved or determined to be achievable  a million increase in salaries and benefits due to increased headcount  and a million increase in legal and consulting expenses related to preparation of our krystexxa bla and patent protection 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in  from million in of the decrease  approximately million resulted from lower salaries  benefits and other expenses related to our oxandrin sales force terminated in january additionally  from to  sarbanes oxley related fees decreased by million  financial consulting fees decreased by million  audit fees decreased by million  and legal fees decreased by million 
partially offsetting these lower costs was a million increase in stock based compensation expense  including performance based stock awards where performance objectives were either achieved or determined to be achievable 
investment income investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase primarily resulted from dividend and interest income on higher average cash balances  partially offset by the impact of lower effective interest rates during as compared to other income expense other income expense decreased million  to an expense of million in  from income of million in our expense was primarily attributable to million of interest and tax penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits for additionally  our results included a million gain on the sale of delatestryl  a million settlement with the ross products division of abbott laboratories related to commission payment overcharges  million of income from the expected receipt of omrix stock from catalyst investments  lp  or catalyst  in connection with our agreement with catalyst and million related to a settlement of litigation with novo nordisk 
income tax benefit provision for income taxes decreased million  to a benefit of million in  from an expense of  in the income tax benefit reflects the tax effects of the carryback of our net operating loss to the tax year to recover income taxes paid  a change in the estimated book to tax differences in our federal income tax return as filed in september along with the impact of research and development tax credits for   and applied against our taxable income which resulted in a refund of taxes paid of million and a decrease in our annual effective tax rate 
we carried back our federal net operating losses  to the extent allowable  against taxable income and received an additional refund of approximately million during which was reflected in recoverable income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operations  including principally the development of krystexxa 
in recent years we have financed our operations through the divestiture of assets  revenues from the sale of oxandrin and oxandrolone  and income tax refunds 
our revenues from oxandrin have decreased significantly in recent years and they continue to decrease as a result of generic competition 
although we may consider divesting oxandrin and oxandrolone  any proceeds of that divestiture would not provide significant cash  and we do not have further non core assets to divest 
as a result  we currently finance our operations principally from cash on hand  investment income earned from our cash on hand  and realization of tax benefits 
the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products requires substantial funds and we currently have no committed external sources of capital 
as a result  we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital should we commercialize krystexxa 
we continue to evaluate the potential collaboration with third parties involving krystexxa in the united states and internationally and continue to consider other strategic options and opportunities globally to optimize shareholder value 
if we are successful in our pursuit of any of these strategic options and opportunities  our capital requirement may decline  perhaps materially 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
our current operating plan assumes the approval and launch of krystexxa in the third quarter of and includes a ramp up of expenses and spending in the latter part of the third quarter of for the hiring of a sales organization  including a person sales force and district and national sales managers  and an increase in marketing expenses in preparation for the commercial product launch 
our current operating plan does not provide a contingency fund for any unexpected commitments that may occur as a result of the fda s review of our bla for krystexxa 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  related investment income and tax benefits realized will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations at least through february tax benefits as of december   we had a net operating loss for federal income taxes of million 
subject to applicable tax regulations  we are entitled to carry these net operating losses back to recover a portion of our prior federal income taxes paid 
in april  we received million of federal income tax refunds based on our use of this net operating loss carryback 
in  we expect to be able to recover an additional million refund of federal income taxes paid in prior periods 
this recovery in of prior income taxes paid will exhaust our ability to use our net operating loss to recover prior income taxes paid  so we do not expect to receive any further cash from tax benefits after cash flows for the year ended december   we used net cash of million in operating activities 
this consisted of a net loss for the period of million  offset in part by million of federal income tax benefits realized and million received from the issuance of common stock primarily as a result of exercise of stock options 
we received million from investment activities resulting primarily from redemptions of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio  or the portfolio 
the proceeds from the redemptions were re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
for the year ended december   we used net cash of million in operating activities 
this consisted of a net loss for the period of million  offset in part by million of federal income tax benefits realized and million received from the issuance of common stock primarily as a result of exercise of stock options 
we used million in cash from investment activities  resulting primarily from the purchase of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio 
we utilized cash in the amount of million for capital expenditures in  primarily due to leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment associated with the amended sublease agreement that returned approximately  square feet of office space in our corporate headquarters location to us 
in november  we used million in cash to purchase an investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio  which is classified on our consolidated balance sheets as restricted short term and long term investments 
in december  columbia management  or columbia  a unit of bank of america  or boa  closed the portfolio to new investments and redemptions and began an orderly liquidation and dissolution of the portfolio s assets for distribution to the unit holders  thereby restricting our potential to invest in and withdraw from the portfolio 
as of december   approximately million  or  of our original million investment has been redeemed and re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
additional redemptions of million are expected by the end of with the remaining balance to be redeemed after at december   the fair market value of restricted investment securities was million  million of which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of short term investments and million of which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of long term other assets 
at december   the fair market value of our investment in the portfolio was million  million of which was reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as short term investments and million of which was reflected as long term other assets 
funding requirements we expect to devote substantial resources to continue our efforts to advance the development and regulatory review of krystexxa  seek fda approval of the bla filing for krystexxa  and prepare for the commercial launch of the product in the united states 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements 
if the fda does not approve our bla  if we are not successful in commercializing krystexxa  or if the fda materially delays its approval of krystexxa  our cash needs will increase  our business will be materially harmed and we may need to curtail or cease operations 
if the fda does approve our bla  we will be required to make significant expenditures in connection with the commercialization of krystexxa  and we may be required to seek additional funding 
we continue to evaluate potential collaborations with third parties involving krystexxa in the united states and internationally and continue to consider other strategic options and opportunities globally to optimize shareholder value 
if we are successful in our pursuit of any of these strategic options and opportunities  our capital requirements may decline  perhaps materially 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding may not be on terms that are acceptable to us  particularly in light of current macroeconomic conditions 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings  we may incur substantial interest expense and could become subject to financial and other covenants that could restrict our ability to take specified actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
if additional funds are not available on favorable terms  or at all  we may be required to curtail or cease operations 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitment obligations other commitments total purchase commitment obligations represent our contractually obligated minimum purchase requirements based on our current manufacturing and supply and other agreements in place with third parties 
the table does not include potential future purchase commitments for which the amounts and timing of payments cannot be reasonably predicted 
other commitments represent obligations related to potential developmental milestone payments and other commitments that we believe are probable to occur during the krystexxa research and development process up through and including regulatory submission 
developmental and sales based milestone payments that occur upon or subsequent to regulatory approval have not been included in the table due to the uncertainly of achieving regulatory approval 
in the event that krystexxa receives regulatory approval  the resulting milestone payment obligation would be approximately million 
if we successfully commercialize krystexxa and achieve certain sales levels  sales based milestone payments could reach approximately million 
other commitments also includes accrued severance costs of million related to a general release and separation agreement with our former president and chief executive officer 
we have received financial grants in support of research and development from the office of the chief scientist of the state of israel  or ocs  and the israel united states bi national industrial research and development foundation  or bird  of approximately million and million  respectively for the development of krystexxa 
these grants are subject to repayment through royalties on the commercial sales of krystexxa if and when they commence 
the ocs grants were received by our former subsidiary  btg  and upon our divestiture of btg to ferring  we agreed to remain obligated to reimburse btg for its repayments to ocs that relate to the krystexxa financial grants 
our aggregate principle repayment obligation plus interest to ocs and bird if we successfully launch krystexxa and  as per our agreements with btg and diosynth manufacture of our annual worldwide bulk product requirements outside of israel  is approximately million at december  these payments have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulatory approval and commercialization of krystexxa 
in addition  under the israeli law of encouragement of research and development in industry  as amended  as a result of the funding received from ocs  if we do not manufacture of our krystexxa annual worldwide bulk product requirements in israel  we may be subject to total payments ranging from to of the repayment obligation plus interest  based upon the percentage of manufacturing that does not occur in israel 
if krystexxa is approved  we plan to initiate a risk evaluation mitigation strategy  or rems  program to evaluate the long term safety of krystexxa in patients with tfg 
the program would also evaluate the long term effectiveness of krystexxa  determine prescribing patterns and evaluate the quality of life outcomes for patients on krystexxa therapy 
while we currently do not have any material commitments associated with the rems program  we plan to spend approximately million to million on the program over the next five years 
we may have significant obligations and commitments in the future related to the rems program 
we intend to fund the study with potential revenues from krystexxa 
as a result of our adoption of fin on january   we have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  we estimate that million of this liability will be paid within the next twelve months and are unable to estimate the amount or the timing of payments  if any  on the remaining million of this liability 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

the fsp is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december   and shall be applied prospectively 
retrospective application to a prior interim or annual reporting period is not permitted 
the adoption of fsp eitf did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fasb fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp no 
clarifies the application of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  in a market that is not active and provides an example of key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp no 
was effective on october  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we adopted fsp no 
on october  the adoption of fsp no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  or sfas no 
this statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements of non governmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
this statement is effective on november  the effective date is tied to the united states securities and exchange commission s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendment to au section  the meaning of presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which occurred in september the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued sab no 
which expresses the views of the sec staff regarding the use of a simplified method  as discussed in sab no 
and which provides guidance in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payment 
in particular  the staff of the sec indicated in sab no 
that it will accept a company s election to use the simplified method  regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to make more refined estimates of expected term 
at the time sab no 
was issued  the staff of the sec believed that more detailed external information about employee exercise behavior eg  employee exercise patterns by industry and or other categories of companies would  over time  become readily available to companies 
therefore  the staff of the sec stated in sab no 
that it would not expect a company to use the simplified method for share option grants after december  sab no 
discusses that such detailed information about employee exercise behavior may not be widely available by december  accordingly  the staff of the sec will continue to accept  under certain circumstances  the use of the simplified method after december  we employed the simplified method for all stock options granted prior to december  we utilize historical experience as the basis for the expected term for all stock options granted subsequent to december  in september  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the eitf affirmed as a consensus the tentative conclusion that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the eitf reached a final consensus that is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
consistent with the consensus  we have deferred approximately million of these costs as of december  and have amortized approximately million of these costs into expense for the year ended december   based on services performed 
the net deferred balance of million as of december  is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
 which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
does not eliminate any disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  our adoption of sfas no 
did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements since we did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing assets or liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued staff position  or fsp  no 
fsp no 
delayed the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis and at least annually 
the delay is intended to allow the fasb and its constituents  additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas no 
since we do not carry any non financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis  the conclusion of the sfas no 
deferral period will not have an effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  our adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our adoption of sfas no 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we refer to as fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the consolidated balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted fin effective january  as a result of the implementation of fin in  we recorded a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including million of accrued interest and penalties  which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
this increase in liability resulted in a corresponding increase to accumulated deficit 
the total amount of federal  state  local and foreign liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december   including accrued penalties and interest 
the net increase of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits subsequent to adoption resulted in a corresponding decrease to the income tax benefit within our consolidated statements of operations as well as an increase to the deferred tax asset for which no tax benefit will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations
