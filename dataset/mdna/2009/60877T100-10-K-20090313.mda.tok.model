item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results 
there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview momenta is a biotechnology company with a product pipeline of both complex mixture generic and novel drugs 
this pipeline is derived from our proprietary  innovative technology platform for the detailed structural analysis of complex mixture drugs 
we use this platform to study the structure thorough characterization of chemical components  structure process design and control of manufacturing process  and structure activity relating structure to biological and clinical activity of complex mixture drugs 
our complex mixture generics and follow on biologics effort is focused on building a thorough understanding of the structure process activity of complex mixture drugs to develop generic versions of marketed products 
while we use a similar analytical and development approach across all of our product candidates  we tailor that approach for each specific product candidate 
our first objective is to apply our core analytical technology to thoroughly characterize the structure of the marketed product 
by defining the chemical composition of multiple batches of the marketed product  we are able to develop an equivalence window which captures the inherent variability of the innovator s manufacturing process 
using this information we then build an extensive understanding of the structure process relationship to design and control our manufacturing process to reproducibly manufacture an equivalent version of the marketed product 
where necessary  and as required by the fda  we will supplement an application with additional supportive structure activity data eg  immunogenicity  pharmacodynamics 
our goal is to obtain fda approval for and commercialize generic or follow on versions of complex mixture products  thereby providing high quality  safe and affordable medicines to patients in need 
our two most advanced complex generic candidates target marketed products which were originally approved by the fda as new drug applications  or ndas 
therefore  we were able to access the existing generic regulatory pathway and submit an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  for these generic candidates 
m enoxaparin is designed to be a technology enabled generic version of lovenox enoxaparin sodium injection  a low molecular weight heparin  or lmwh  used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
this drug is a complex mixture of polysaccharide chains derived from naturally sourced heparin 
our second major generic product candidate is m  a technology enabled generic version of copaxone glatiramer acetate injection  a drug that is indicated for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapse remitting multiple sclerosis  or rrms 
copaxone consists of a complex mixture of polypeptide chains 
with m  we have extended our core characterization capabilities from the characterization of complex polysaccharide mixtures to include the characterization of complex polypeptide mixtures 
in addition to our two complex generic product candidates  which are both currently under review by fda  we have further extended our analytical and development platform to pursue generic or follow on versions of biologic drugs 
our efforts on m  as well as our ongoing glycoprotein research program  are focused on developing generic or follow on versions of marketed therapeutic proteins  which are derived from natural or cell based manufacturing processes 
by thoroughly characterizing these biologic molecules  we seek to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between their manufacturing processes and final product compositions 
our goal is to replicate our development 
table of contents approach with m enoxaparin and m and pursue the development and commercialization of multiple generic or follow on versions of marketed therapeutics 
our complex mixture novel drug research and development efforts leverage our analytical technology platform and structure process knowledge to develop novel drugs by studying the structure activity of complex mixtures and develop novel drugs 
with our capabilities to thoroughly characterize complex mixtures  we are targeting our efforts to understand the relationship between structure and the biological and therapeutic activity of various complex mixture drugs 
our goal is to capitalize on the structural diversity and multi targeting potential of these complex mixtures to engineer novel drugs that we believe will meet key unmet medical needs in various diseases 
while we believe that our capabilities to engineer improved and novel complex mixture drugs can be applied across several product categories with significant therapeutic potential  such as polysaccharides  polypeptides and glycoproteins  our initial focus has been in the area of complex polysaccharide mixtures 
our lead novel drug candidate  m  has been engineered to possess what we believe will be an improved therapeutic profile compared with other currently marketed products to support the treatment of acs 
we also are seeking to discover and develop novel therapeutics by applying our technology to better understand the function of these polysaccharide mixtures in biological processes  with an initial focus in oncology 
since our inception in may  we have incurred annual net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we recognized net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we develop our product candidates  expand our research and development activities and prepare for the potential commercial launch of our product candidates 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
our revenues for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  have been derived from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and primarily consist of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs for certain programs 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses 
in july  we raised million in a follow on public offering  net of expenses  from the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in september  in connection with the sandoz collaboration  we sold  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in december  we raised million in a public offering  net of expenses  from the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resource expenditures to the research and development of our product candidates 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any revenue from product sales and are uncertain whether or not we will generate any revenue from the sale of products over the next several years 
we have recognized  in the aggregate  million of revenue from our inception through december  this revenue was derived entirely from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration 
we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of research and development payments  profit sharing payments  milestone payments and royalties in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and similar future collaborative or strategic relationships 
we expect that 
table of contents any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  contract research and manufacturing  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs development programs m enoxaparin our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a generic version of lovenox 
lovenox is a widely prescribed lmwh used for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
under our sandoz collaboration  we work with sandoz exclusively to develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin in the us and sandoz is responsible for funding substantially all of the us related m enoxaparin development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs 
the total cost of development and commercialization  and the timing of m enoxaparin product launch  are subject to uncertainties relating to the development  regulatory approval and legal processes 
our collaborative partner  sandoz  submitted andas in its name to the fda for m enoxaparin in syringe and vial forms seeking approval to market m enoxaparin in the united states 
both andas currently include a paragraph iv certification stating that sanofi aventis patents listed in the orange book for lovenox are  among other things  invalid and unenforceable 
the fda is currently reviewing both m enoxaparin andas  including our manufacturing data and technology and characterization methodology 
in november  sandoz received a letter from the fda stating that the syringe anda for m enoxaparin was not approvable in its current form because the anda did not adequately address the potential for immunogenicity of the drug product 
starting in early  we and sandoz conferred with the fda concerning the design of studies to address the fda s concerns in this area 
these interactions led to the fda s general concurrence with our proposed approach and to the submission of an immunogenicity amendment to the m enoxaparin anda in september  although the anda review process is ongoing  the fda has not requested human clinical trials at this time 
however  there can be no assurances that the fda will not require such studies in the future and we cannot predict with a high degree of certainty the timing of any potential approval of the m enoxaparin anda by the fda 
we and sandoz are working together to prepare for the commercialization of m enoxaparin  if and when approved  by advancing manufacturing  supply chain  and sales and marketing objectives 
our sandoz collaboration expanded our collaboration efforts related to m enoxaparin to include the european union 
under the sandoz collaboration  we will share certain development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs as well as a portion of the profits  if any 

table of contents m m is designed to be a technology enabled generic version of copaxone  a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polypeptide chains 
copaxone is indicated for reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapse remitting multiple sclerosis 
multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration 
in north america  copaxone is marketed through teva neuroscience llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  and distributed by sanofi aventis 
teva and sanofi aventis have an additional collaborative arrangement for the marketing of copaxone in europe and other markets  under which copaxone is either co promoted with teva or is marketed solely by sanofi aventis 
under the definitive agreement  we and sandoz jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m we are responsible for funding substantially all of the us related m development costs  with sandoz responsible for legal and commercialization costs 
outside of the us  we and sandoz share equally the development costs  with sandoz responsible for commercialization and legal costs 
in december  our collaborative partner  sandoz  submitted to the fda an anda in its name containing a paragraph iv certification seeking approval to market m in the united states 
in july  the fda notified sandoz that it had accepted the anda for review as of december  in addition  the fda s published database indicates that the first substantially complete anda submitted for glatiramer acetate injection containing a paragraph iv certification was filed on december   making sandoz anda eligible for the grant of a day generic exclusivity period upon approval 
m m is a novel anticoagulant that was rationally designed to capture  in a single therapy  the positive attributes of both unfractionated heparin reversibility  monitorability and broad inhibition of the coagulation cascade and lmwh adequate bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics to allow for convenient subcutaneous administration 
we believe that m has the potential to provide baseline anticoagulant therapy for patients diagnosed with acs who are medically managed and who may or may not require coronary intervention in order to treat their condition  as well as for patients diagnosed with stable angina who require a coronary intervention 
we believe that the properties of m observed to date in both preclinical and clinical investigations continue to support the design hypothesis and may provide physicians with a more flexible treatment option than is currently available 
acs includes several diseases ranging from unstable angina  which is characterized by chest pain at rest  to acute myocardial infarction  or heart attack  which is caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery 
currently  a majority of patients are initially medically managed with an anti clotting agent  such as lmwh or unfractionated heparin  or ufh  in combination with other therapies 
an increasing proportion of acs patients are also proceeding to early intervention with procedures such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting  or cabg 
both angioplasty and cabg require anticoagulant therapy to prevent clot formation during and immediately following the procedure 
m is designed to be a lmwh that could be used in multiple settings  including initial medical management  angioplasty or cabg 
in july  we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda for our m intravenous injection product and in october began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 
in october  we began a phase a clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing m intravenous injection as an anticoagulant in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
we expect enrollment in the phase a clinical trial to conclude in the second quarter of in march  we filed an ind for our m subcutaneous injection product  and in may began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 

table of contents glycoproteins glycoproteins are proteins to which sugar molecules are attached 
examples of glycoprotein drugs are erythropoietin  blood clotting factors and interferon beta 
we are applying our technology to the development of generic or biosimilar glycoprotein drugs 
we believe that this technology can further be used in assisting pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in developing improved and next generation versions of their branded products by analyzing and modifying the sugar structures contained in the branded products  and can also be used to engineer novel complex mixture drugs 
our glycoprotein program is focused on extending our technology for the analysis of complex sugars to glycoproteins 
the goal of the program is to facilitate the development of generic or biosimilar versions of major marketed glycoprotein drugs 
under our sandoz collaboration  we are currently applying our technology to develop a generic or follow on version of a marketed glycoprotein in partnership with sandoz 
we refer to this product candidate as m discovery program we are also applying our analytical capabilities to drug discovery 
our discovery program is focused on the role that complex sugars play in biological systems  including regulating the development and progression of disease 
our initial focus is in the area of cancer  where we are seeking to discover sugar sequences with anti cancer properties for development as therapeutics  and we are advancing an oncology product candidate that is in the advanced discovery phase 
sugars play a part in the conversion of normal cells into cancerous cells  the regulation of tumor growth and tumor invasion and metastasis 
we believe that our technology can provide us with a better understanding of the role of sugars in disease  enabling us to discover novel sugar therapeutics  as well as to discover new disease mechanisms that can be targeted with other small molecule and biologic drugs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  legal  accounting  investor relations  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility and insurance costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services and other general expenses 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue revenue for was million  compared with million for and million for revenue for the year ended december  consists of amounts earned by us under our sandoz collaboration for reimbursement of research and development services  reimbursement of development costs and amortization of the initial payment received and amounts earned by us under our sandoz collaboration for amortization of the equity premium  reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs 
revenue decreased million from to due primarily to a million decrease in reimbursable expenses associated with the development of m enoxaparin 
the manufacturing costs for pre launch inventory for m enoxaparin are incurred directly by sandoz and therefore do not flow through our collaborative revenues 
revenue increased million from to due primarily to million of reimbursable expenditures associated with the first year of the sandoz collaboration  a million increase in 
table of contents reimbursable development expenditures associated with preparing for the potential commercial launch of m enoxaparin in the us  and million of the first year of amortization related to the equity premium 
research and development research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the decrease of million  or  from to principally resulted from decreases of million in process development  manufacturing and third party research costs in support of our development programs  principally our m enoxaparin and m programs  million in stock based compensation expense  million in process research and development expense related to the parivid asset purchase  and million in consultant costs 
these decreases were offset by increases of million in personnel and related costs associated with the growth in our research and development organization  million in laboratory expenses and million in depreciation expense 
the increase of million  or  from to principally resulted from increases of million in manufacturing  process development and third party research costs in support of our m  m enoxaparin and glycoprotein programs  million in clinical trial costs for our m program  million in personnel and related costs associated with the growth in our research and development organization  million in laboratory supplies  and a million in process research and development charge related to the parivid asset purchase 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase in support of our product candidates 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenditures for our principal research and development programs for the years ended december    and  and shows the total external costs incurred by us for each of our major research and development projects 
the table excludes costs incurred by our collaboration partner on such major research and development projects 
the company does not maintain or evaluate  and therefore does not allocate  internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
consequently  the company does not analyze internal research and development costs by project in managing its research and development activities 
research and development expense in thousands project inception to december  development programs status m enoxaparin anda filed m anda filed m phase a other development programs discovery programs research and development internal costs total research and development expense 
table of contents the decrease of million in external expenditures related to our m enoxaparin program from to was primarily due to lower manufacturing activity and a shift to commercial activity being contracted directly with sandoz 
the decrease of million in external expenditures related to our m program from to was primarily related to the timing of drug process work and the investment required to support the anda filing at the end of the decrease of million in external expenditures on our m program from to was primarily attributable to start up costs incurred in for the phase a clinical trial 
the increase of million in external expenditures related to our m enoxaparin program from to was primarily due to increased process development  manufacturing costs and third party research 
the increase in external expenditures on our m program of million from to was primarily related to drug process work and the investment required to support the anda filing at the end of the increase of million in external expenditures on our m program from to was primarily attributable to increased clinical costs as we progressed from preclinical to phase and phase a clinical studies 
the research and development internal costs  which consist of compensation and other expense for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation  remained relatively consistent from to the increase of million from to was due to additional research and development headcount and related costs in support of our development programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  from to due to a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense primarily due to a revision of the expected vesting date on certain performance based restricted stock awards and a decrease of million in professional fees due to a reduction in legal and consulting activities 
general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  from to primarily due to a decrease of million in professional fees due to a reduction in legal activities  offset by an increase of million in personnel and related costs due to increased headcount 
we expect our general and administrative expenses  including internal and external legal and business development costs that support our various product development efforts  to vary from period to period in relation to our research and development activities 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million from to was primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to novartis pharma ag in september interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to additional amounts drawn from our equipment line of credit during and 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and borrowings from our lines of credit and capital lease obligations 
since our inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in july  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in september  we received net proceeds of million from novartis pharma ag s purchase of  shares of our common stock in connection with our sandoz collaboration 
in december  we completed a public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
as of december   we have received a cumulative total of million from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  million from debt financing  million from capital lease obligations  million from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility and additional funds from interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in addition  we also hold million in restricted cash which serves as collateral for a letter of credit related to our facility lease 
during the years ended december   and  our operating activities used million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash for operating activities generally approximates our net loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items include stock based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization of million and accretion of discount on investments of million 
for the year ended december   our net loss adjusted for non cash items was million 
in addition  the net change in our operating assets and liabilities provided million and resulted from a decrease in accounts receivable of million  due to the timing of cash receipts from sandoz  a decrease in unbilled collaboration revenue of million  resulting from decreased manufacturing and research costs for our m enoxaparin program  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  related to declining investment balances and lower interest rates  a decrease in accounts payable of million  due to the payment of manufacturing and research costs for our m enoxaparin program  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  due to the amortization of the million equity premium paid by novartis in connection with the sandoz collaboration  and an increase in accrued expenses of million  due to the timing of vendor payments 
for the year ended december   our net loss adjusted for non cash items was million 
in addition  the net change in our operating assets and liabilities provided million and resulted from increases in accounts receivable of million and unbilled collaboration revenue of million  due to timing of cash receipts from sandoz and an increase in billable activities  a decrease in restricted cash of million due to the cancellation of a letter of credit for a terminated sublease  an increase in accounts payable of million  resulting from increased manufacturing and research costs for our programs  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  due to the amortization of the million equity premium 

table of contents for the year ended december   our net loss adjusted for non cash items was million 
in addition  the net change in our operating assets and liabilities provided million  primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of million relating to the equity premium offset by the restriction of million in conjunction with a letter of credit for a sublease 
remaining increases of approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to general increases in our business activities as a result of greater headcount and increased product development costs 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  and we received million from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  offset by cash provided of million in maturities of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  offset by cash provided of million in maturities of marketable securities 
during the years ended december   and  we used million  million and million  respectively  to purchase laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we received net proceeds of million from our public offering of common stock in december and million from stock option exercises and purchases of common shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
these proceeds were offset by principal payments of million on our line of credit and lease agreement obligations and million on financed leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we borrowed million on an equipment lease agreement entered into in december  recovered million in property and equipment from the assignment of a sublease  received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and purchases of common shares through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by principal payments of million on our line of credit and lease agreement obligations and payments of million on financed leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag  of which million was classified as deferred revenue 
additionally  we borrowed million on an equipment lease agreement  received million in financing from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility  and received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and purchases of common shares through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by principal payments of million on our line of credit and lease agreement obligations and payments of million on financed leasehold improvements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period through through after contractual obligations in thousands total license maintenance obligations short and long term line of credit obligation capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations after  the annual obligations  which extend indefinitely  are approximately million per year 

table of contents we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accrued expenses and certain equity instruments 
prior to our initial public offering  we also evaluated our estimates and judgments regarding the fair valuation assigned to our common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services are deferred and recognized over the performance period 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue is recognized is based on estimates by management and may change over the course of the performance period 
at the inception of a collaboration agreement  we estimate the term of our performance obligation based on our development plans and our estimate of the regulatory review period 
the development plans generally include designing a manufacturing process to make the drug product  scaling up the process  contributing to the preparation of regulatory filings  further scaling up the manufacturing process to commercial scale and related development of intellectual property 
each reporting period we reassess our remaining performance obligations under the applicable collaboration arrangement by considering the time period over which any remaining development and related services to be provided prior to obtaining regulatory approval are expected to be completed 
changes in our estimate could occur due to changes in our development plans or due to changes in regulatory or legal requirements 
we have deferred upfront payments of million and million in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  respectively 
such upfront payments are being recognized over our estimated period of performance obligation  which is approximately five and a half years and six years  respectively  from the applicable collaboration inception date 
the deferral period for the upfront payment associated with our sandoz collaboration was completed during revenue from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities we invest our excess cash in bank deposits  money market accounts  corporate debt securities  commercial paper and us government sponsored enterprise obligations 
we consider all highly liquid 
table of contents investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are carried at fair value  which approximates cost  and primarily consist of money market funds maintained at major us financial institutions 
all marketable securities  which primarily represent marketable debt securities  have been classified as available for sale 
purchased premiums or discounts on debt securities are amortized to interest income through the stated maturities of the debt securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are included in interest income 
during the year ended december   we recorded realized gains on marketable securities of  there were no realized gains or losses on marketable securities during the years ended december  or the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest earned on marketable securities is included in interest income 
intangible assets we have acquired intangible assets that we value and record 
those assets for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that are specifically identified and have alternative future uses are capitalized 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets at acquisition 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk and the cost of capital 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach when impairment indicators arise 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  we would write down the intangible asset to the discounted cash flow value 
where we cannot identify cash flows for an individual asset  our review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
fair value of other financial instruments the carrying amounts of our other financial instruments  which include other accrued expenses  approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
the carrying amount of our line of credit and capital lease obligations approximate their fair values due to their variable interest rates 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents stock based compensation we adopted the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  effective january  under the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation expense in our operations  and accordingly the adoption of sfas r fair value method has had and will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and provided pro forma disclosures of net loss attributable and net loss per share allocable to common stockholders as if we had adopted the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
we determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected term of an option 
in determining our volatility  we have considered implied volatilities of currently traded options to provide an estimate of volatility based upon current trading activity in addition to our historical volatility 
after considering other factors such as our stage of development and the length of time we have been public  we believe a blended volatility rate based upon historical performance  as well as the implied volatilities of currently traded options  best reflects the expected volatility of our stock going forward 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause stock based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
the expected term of awards represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding 
we use a blend of our own historical employee exercise and post vest termination behavior and expected term data from our peer group to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
for purposes of identifying similar entities  we considered characteristics such as industry  stage of life cycle and financial leverage 
we update these assumptions as needed to reflect recent historical data 
additionally  we are required to estimate forfeiture rates to approximate the number of shares that will vest in a period to which the fair value is applied 
we will continually monitor employee exercise behavior and may further adjust the estimated term and forfeiture rates in future periods 
increasing the estimated life would result in an increase in the fair value to be recognized over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures will be adjusted to actual forfeitures upon the vest date of the cancelled options as a cumulative adjustment on a quarterly basis 
the risk free interest rates used in the black scholes merton option pricing model are based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock option 
the value of our restricted stock awards is recognized as compensation cost in our consolidated statements of operations over each award s explicit or implicit service periods 
we estimate an award s implicit service period based on our best estimate of the period over which an award s vesting conditions will be achieved 
we reevaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and will recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation as of the date of an estimate revision over the revised remaining implicit service period 
in june  we revised the implicit service period for certain performance based restricted stock awards due to a change in the expected vesting date 
as a result of this change in estimate  our net loss and net loss per share for the year ended december  was million and per share  respectively  less than had the estimate remained unchanged 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  we recognized total stock based compensation expense under sfas r of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option awards amounted to million  including estimated forfeitures  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of years 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards amounted to million  including estimated forfeitures  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of approximately years 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r  a replacement for sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
 but requires the recognition of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at their acquisition date fair values 
additionally  sfas r supersedes fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date 
sfas r now requires that purchased research and development be recognized as an intangible asset 
we are required to adopt sfas r prospectively for any acquisitions on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have any impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued eitf issue no

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas requires that noncontrolling interests be reported as a separate component of equity  that net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations  that changes in a parent s ownership interest be accounted for as equity transactions  and that  when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value 
sfas will be applied prospectively  except for presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively  as of the beginning of our fiscal year we do not currently have any noncontrolling interests  and therefore the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued staff position  or fsp  no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 or fsp  which delays the effective date of statement no

 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas sfas enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas was effective january  since sfas requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities  adoption of sfas will not affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows given that we do not engage in derivative or hedging activities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  or sfas sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market  government secured  and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative  foreign currency or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
