executive overview the company is a leading independent distributor of financial services products primarily to high net worth individuals and entrepreneurial companies 
founded in  and commencing operations on january   nfp has grown internally and through acquisitions and  as of december   operates a national distribution network with over owned firms 
the company acquired  and firms in  and  respectively 
as a result of new acquisitions and the growth of previously acquired firms  revenue has grown from million in to nearly billion in  a compound annual growth rate of over 
the company s firms earn revenue that consists primarily of commissions and fees earned from the sale of financial products and services to their clients 
the company s firms also incur commissions and fees expense and operating expense in the course of earning revenue 
nfp pays management fees to non employee principals of its firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of each respective firm 
the company refers to revenue earned by the company s firms less the expenses of its firms  including management fees  as gross margin 
the company excludes amortization and depreciation from gross margin 
these amounts are separately disclosed as part of corporate and other expenses 
management uses gross margin as a measure of the performance of the firms that the company has acquired 
through acquisitions and internal growth  gross margin has grown from million in to million in the company s gross margin is offset by expenses that it incurs at the corporate level  including corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses have grown from million in to million in corporate and other expenses include general and administrative expenses  which are the operating expenses of nfp s corporate headquarters and a portion of stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses have grown from million in to million in general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased from in to in included in corporate and other expenses in was the expense incurred due to the buyout of a management agreement in connection with the acquisition of a management company from its former manager for cash  nfp stock and other consideration totaling million in during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an impairment charge of million resulting in a year to date impairment charge of million 
this represented a increase from impairments of million in the prior year to date period 
this fourth quarter amount represented over of the impairment expense for the year 
the increase in the fourth quarter impairment charge was a result of the completion of the company s most recent evaluation for impairment 
to reflect recent market conditions  the risk adjusted discount rate used as part of this evaluation for impairment was increased 
additionally  the company adjusted its projected future cash flow estimates for certain of its firm subsidiaries in the context of their historical performance  and the effect of the recent economic conditions on their future long term projections 
as a result of these changes in conditions and assumptions  the company recognized an additional charge of million in the quarter as compared to the prior year corresponding period 
many external factors affect the company s revenue and profitability  including economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory developments and competition 
because many of these factors are unpredictable and generally beyond the company s control  the company s revenue and earnings will fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the company s revenue and net income  particularly in the second half of and early  benefited from strong sales of financed life insurance products 
management believes that sales of financed life insurance products diminished in the second half of and this trend continued 
table of contents through in  the decline in gross margin reflected the challenging economic environment which worsened in the second half of the company experienced continued declines in its life insurance revenue in which led to the overall decline in revenue and margins and offset gains in gross margin through the first half of the recent disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets generally has created increasingly difficult conditions for companies in the financial services industry 
continued volatility and a recessionary environment may reduce the demand for the company s services or the products the company distributes and could negatively affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance coverages the company offers its customers could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry  which in turn could have the effect of reduced placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduced revenue and profitability for the company 
in addition  the deterioration in the economy that occurred in fourth quarter could adversely impact nfp in in light of the current financial environment  nfp has taken certain steps to streamline operations and conserve available cash 
on november   nfp reduced headcount at its new york based corporate headquarters 
the headcount reductions resulted in severance charges of approximately million in the fourth quarter of a small portion of the terminated positions will be replaced at the company s austin  texas based facility 
the company continues to explore further expense reductions 
additionally  with the exception of certain sub acquisitions  nfp does not anticipate completing acquisitions until market conditions and financial results stabilize nor does it anticipate repurchasing additional shares under its current share repurchase authorization 
on november   nfp s board of directors also suspended nfp s quarterly cash dividend 
acquisitions while acquisitions remain a component of the company s business strategy over the long term  nfp suspended acquisition activity with the exception of certain sub acquisitions in the latter part of in order to conserve cash 
nfp will continue to reassess the market and economic environment 
under nfp s typical acquisition structure  nfp acquires of the equity of businesses that distribute financial services products on terms that are relatively standard across its acquisitions 
to determine the acquisition price  nfp s management first estimates the annual operating cash flow of the business to be acquired based on current levels of revenue and expense 
for this purpose  management generally defines operating cash flow as cash revenue of the business less cash and non cash expenses  other than amortization  depreciation and compensation to the business s owners or individuals who subsequently become principals 
management refers to this estimated annual operating cash flow as target earnings 
typically  the acquisition price is a multiple generally in a range of five to six times of a portion of the target earnings  which management refers to as base earnings 
under certain circumstances  nfp has paid multiples in excess of six times based on the unique attributes of the transaction that justify the higher value 
base earnings averaged of target earnings for all firms owned at december  in determining base earnings  management focuses on the recurring revenue of the business 
recurring revenue refers to revenue from sales previously made such as renewal commissions on insurance products  commissions and administrative fees for ongoing benefit plans and mutual fund trail commissions and fees for assets under management 
nfp enters into a management agreement with principals and or certain entities they own 
under the management agreement  the principals and or such entities are entitled to management fees consisting of all future earnings of the acquired business in excess of the base earnings up to target earnings  and a percentage of any earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 

table of contents nfp retains a cumulative preferred position in the base earnings 
to the extent earnings of a firm in any year are less than base earnings  in the following year nfp is entitled to receive base earnings together with the prior years shortfall before any management fees are paid 
in certain recent transactions involving large institutional sellers  nfp has provided minimum guaranteed compensation to certain former employees of the seller who became principals of the acquired business 
additional purchase consideration is often paid to the former owners based on satisfying specified internal growth thresholds over the three year period following the acquisition 
sub acquisitions a sub acquisition involves the acquisition by one of the company s firms of a business that is generally too small to qualify for a direct acquisition by nfp or where the individual running the business wishes to exit immediately or soon after the acquisition  prefers to partner with an existing principal or does not wish to become a principal 
the acquisition multiple paid for sub acquisitions is typically lower than the multiple paid for a direct acquisition by nfp 
substantially all of the company s acquisitions have been paid for with a combination of cash and nfp common stock  valued at its then fair market value at the time of acquisition 
nfp requires its principals to take at least of the total acquisition price in nfp common stock 
however  in transactions involving institutional sellers  the purchase price typically consists of substantially all cash 
through december   principals have taken on average approximately of the total acquisition price in nfp common stock 
the following table shows acquisition activity including sub acquisitions in the following periods for the years ended december  in thousands  except number of acquisitions closed number of acquisitions closed consideration cash common stock other a a represents capitalized costs of the acquisitions 
although management believes that nfp will continue to have opportunities to complete a similar number of acquisitions once market conditions stabilize  there can be no assurance that nfp will be successful in identifying and completing acquisitions see risk factors the company may be unsuccessful in acquiring suitable acquisition candidates  which could adversely affect the company s growth 
any change in the company s financial condition or in the environment of the markets in which the company operates could impact its ability to source and complete acquisitions 
revenue the company generates revenue primarily from the following sources corporate and executive benefits commissions and fees 
the company s firms earn commissions on the sale of insurance policies written for benefit programs 
the commissions are paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintain its broker of record relationship with the firm 
the company s firms also earn fees for the development and implementation of corporate and executive benefit programs as well as fees for the duration that these programs are administered 
asset based fees 
table of contents are also earned for administrative services or consulting related to certain benefits plans 
incidental to the corporate and executive benefits services provided to their customers  some of the company s firms offer property and casualty insurance brokerage and advisory services 
the company believes that these services complement the corporate and executive benefits services provided to the company s clients 
in connection with these services  the company earns commissions and fees 
life insurance commissions and estate planning fees 
insurance and annuity commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
first year commissions are calculated as a percentage of the first twelve months premium on the policy and earned in the year that the policy is originated 
in many cases  the company s firms receive renewal commissions for a period following the first year 
some of the company s firms receive fees for the settlement of life insurance policies 
these fees are generally based on a percentage of the settlement proceeds 
the company s firms also earn fees for developing estate plans 
revenue from life insurance activities also includes amounts received by the company s life brokerage entities  including its life settlements brokerage entities  that assists non affiliated producers with the placement and sale of life insurance 
financial planning and investment advisory fees and securities commissions 
the company s firms earn commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products  as well as fees for offering financial advice and related services 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
in a few cases  incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the assets under management 
some of the company s firms charge flat fees for the development of a financial plan or a flat fee annually for advising clients on asset allocation 
some of the company s firms also earn additional compensation in the form of incentive and marketing support revenue from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  persistency and profitability of business generated by the company from these three sources 
incentive and marketing support revenue is recognized at the earlier of notification of a payment or when a payment is received  unless there exists historical data or other information which enable management to reasonably estimate the amount earned during the period 
these forms of payments are earned both with respect to sales by the company s owned firms and sales by nfp s affiliated third party distributors 
nfpsi  nfp s registered broker dealer and investment adviser  also earns commissions and fees on the transactions effected through it 
most principals of the company s firms  as well as many of its affiliated third party distributors  conduct securities or investment advisory business through nfpsi 
although nfp s operating history is limited  historically a significant number of its firms earn approximately to of their revenue in the first three quarters of the year and approximately to of their revenue in the fourth quarter 
in  the company earned approximately of its revenue during the fourth quarter and the company believes that a worsening economic environment punctuated by a widespread deterioration in credit and liquidity  investment losses and a reduction in consumer confidence may result in a change in this pattern for 
table of contents expenses the following table sets forth certain expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated for the years ended december  revenue cost of services commissions and fees operating expenses management fees total cost of services excludes items shown separately below gross margin corporate and other expenses general and administrative amortization depreciation impairment of goodwill and intangible assets management agreement buyout gain loss on sale of businesses total corporate and other expenses excludes amortization and depreciation which are shown separately under corporate and other expenses 
excludes management agreement buyout which is shown separately under corporate and other expenses 
cost of services commissions and fees 
commissions and fees are typically paid to third party producers  who are producers that are affiliated with the company s firms 
commissions and fees are also paid to non affiliated producers who utilize the services of one or more of the company s life brokerage entities including the company s life settlements brokerage entities 
commissions and fees are also paid to non affiliated producers who provide referrals and specific product expertise to nfp firms 
when business is generated solely by a principal  no commission expense is incurred because principals are only paid from a share of the cash flow of the acquired firm through management fees 
however  when income is generated by a third party producer  the producer is generally paid a portion of the commission income  which is reflected as commission expense of the acquired firm 
rather than collecting the full commission and remitting a portion to a third party producer  a firm may include the third party producer on the policy application submitted to a carrier 
the carrier will  in these instances  directly pay each named producer their respective share of the commissions and fees earned 
when this occurs the firm will record only the commissions and fees it receives directly as revenue and have no commission expense 
as a result  the nfp firm will have lower revenue and commission expense and a higher gross margin percentage 
gross margin dollars will be the same 
the transactions in which a nfp firm is listed as the sole producer and pays commissions to a third party producer  versus transactions in which the carrier pays each producer directly  will cause nfp s gross margin percentage to fluctuate without affecting gross margin dollars or earnings 
in addition  nfpsi pays commissions to the company s affiliated third party distributors who transact business through nfpsi 
operating expenses 
the company s firms incur operating expenses related to maintaining individual offices  including compensating producing and non producing staff 
firm operating expenses also include the expenses of nfpsi and nfpisi  two subsidiaries that serve the company s acquired firms and through which the company s acquired firms and its third party distributors who are members of its marketing organizations access insurance and financial services products and manufacturers 
with the adoption of sfas r the company 
table of contents now records share based payments related to firm employees and firm activities to operating expenses as a component of cost of services 
previously all share based expense components for year end periods prior to december  were recorded under corporate and other expenses general and administrative expense 
management fees 
nfp pays management fees to the principals of its firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of the firms they manage 
nfp typically pays a portion of the management fees monthly in advance 
once nfp receives cumulative preferred earnings base earnings from a firm  the principals and or entity the principals own will earn management fees equal to earnings above base earnings and up to target earnings 
an additional management fee is paid in respect of earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
for example  if base earnings equal of target earnings  nfp receives of earnings in excess of target earnings and the principals and or the entities they own receive 
a majority of the company s acquisitions have been completed with a ratio of base earnings to target earnings of 
management fees also include an accrual for certain performance based incentive amounts payable under nfp s ongoing incentive plan 
incentive amounts have historically been paid in a combination of cash and nfp common stock 
in addition to the incentive award  nfp pays an additional cash incentive equal to of the incentive award elected to be received in nfp common stock 
this election is made subsequent to the completion of the incentive period 
for firms that began their incentive period prior to january   the principals could elect from to to be paid in nfp common stock 
no accrual is made for these additional cash incentives until the related election is made 
however  for firms beginning their incentive period on or after january  with the exception of highland firms  which completed this initial incentive period in  the principal is required to take a minimum of maximum of the incentive award in nfp common stock 
the company accrues on a current basis for these firms the additional cash incentive of the stock portion of the award based upon the principal s election on the minimum percentage required to be received in nfp stock 
effective december   nfp has elected to pay all incentive awards under this plan in cash 
management fees are reduced by amounts paid by the principals and or certain entities they own under the terms of the management agreement for capital expenditures  including sub acquisitions  in excess of  these amounts may be paid in full or over a mutually agreeable period of time and are recorded as a deferred reduction in management fees 
amounts recorded as a deferred reduction in management fees are amortized as a reduction in management fee expense generally over the useful life of the asset 
the ratio of management fees to gross margin before management fees is dependent on the percentage of total earnings of the company s firms capitalized by the company  the performance of the company s firms relative to base earnings and target earnings  the growth of earnings of the company s firms in the periods after their first three years following acquisition and the earnings of nfpisi  nfpsi and a small number of firms without a principal  from which no management fees are paid 
due to nfp s cumulative preferred position  if a firm produces earnings below target earnings in a given year  nfp s share of the firm s total earnings would be higher for that year 
if a firm produces earnings at or above target earnings  nfp s share of the firm s total earnings would be equal to the percentage of the earnings capitalized by nfp in the initial transaction  less any percentage due to additional management fees earned under ongoing incentive plans 
with the adoption of sfas r  effective january   the company records share based payments related to principals in management fees which are included as a component of cost of services 
previously  all shared based expense components for year end periods prior to december  were recorded under corporate and other expenses general and administrative expense 
the following table summarizes the results of operations of nfp s firms for the periods presented and uses non gaap measures 
gross margin before management fees represents the profitability of the company s business before principals receive participation in the earnings 
gross margin before management fees as a percentage of revenue represents the base profitability of the company divided by the revenue of the company s business 
whether or not a principal participates in the earnings of a firm is dependent on the specific characteristics and performance of that firm 
management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees represents the percentage of earnings that is not retained by the company as profit  but is paid out to principals 

table of contents the company uses gross margin before management fees and gross margin before management fees as a percentage of revenue to evaluate how the company s business is performing before giving consideration to a principal s participation in their firm s earnings 
this measure is the one in which the principal is compensated for their direct operating authority and control and on which the company measures the principal s performance 
management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees is a measure that management uses to evaluate how much of the company s margin and margin growth is being shared with principals 
this management fee percentage is a variable  not a fixed  ratio 
management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees will fluctuate based upon the aggregate mix of earnings performance by individual firms 
it is based on the percentage of the company s earnings that are capitalized at the time of acquisition  the performance relative to nfp s preferred position in the earnings and the growth of the individual firms and in the aggregate for further discussion on the acquisition model and management fee structure  see business acquisition strategy acquisition model 
management fees may be higher during periods of strong growth due to the increase in incentive accruals 
higher incentive accruals will generally be accompanied by higher firm earnings 
where firm earnings decrease  management fees and management fee percentage may be lower as incentive accruals are either reduced or eliminated 
further  since nfp retains a cumulative preferred interest in firm earnings base earnings the relative percentage of management fees decreases as firm earnings decline 
for firms that do not achieve base earnings  principals earn no management fee 
thus  a principal earns more management fees only when firm earnings grow and  conversely  principals earn less should earnings decline 
this structure provides the company with protection against earnings shortfalls through reduced management fee expense 
in this manner the interests of both principals and shareholders remain aligned 
management uses these non gaap measures to evaluate the performance of its firms and the results of the company s model 
this cannot be effectively illustrated using the corresponding gaap measures as management fees would be included in these gaap measures and produce a less meaningful measure for this evaluation 
on a firm specific basis the company uses these measures to help the company determine where to allocate corporate and other resources to assist firm principals to develop additional sources of revenue and improve their earnings performance 
the company may assist these firms in cross selling  providing new products or services  technology improvements  providing capital for sub acquisitions or coordinating internal mergers 
on a macro level the company uses these measurements to help it evaluate broad performance of products and services which  in turn  helps shape the company s acquisition policy 
in recent years the company has emphasized acquiring businesses with a higher level of recurring revenue  such as benefits businesses  and those which expand its platform capabilities 
the company also may use these measures to help it assess the level of economic ownership to retain in new acquisitions or existing firms 
finally  the company uses these measures to monitor the effectiveness of its ongoing incentive plan 

table of contents management fees were of gross margin before management fees in compared with in and in in  as gross margin before management fees as a percentage of revenue has declined  the principals percentage participation in these earnings has also declined 
in  although gross margin before management fees increased  the management fee expense did not keep pace as the company had increased its retained interest in more recent acquisitions and had a greater share of its earnings contributed by nfpsi and nfpisi for which no management fee expense is incurred

corporate and other expenses general and administrative 
at the corporate level  the company incurs general and administrative expense related to the acquisition and administration of its firms 
general and administrative expense includes both cash and stock based compensation  occupancy  professional fees  travel and entertainment  technology  telecommunication  advertising and marketing  internal audit and certain corporate compliance costs 
prior to the adoption of sfas r on january   all stock based compensation was included in general and administrative expense

total stock based compensation was million  million and million in   and respectively 
stock based compensation included in corporate and other expenses general and administrative was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
amortization 
the company incurs amortization expense related to the amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation 
the company incurs depreciation expense related to capital assets  such as investments in technology  office furniture and equipment as well as amortization for its leasehold improvements 
depreciation expense related to the company s firms as well as nfp s corporate office is recorded within this line item 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the company evaluates its amortizing long lived assets and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  long lived assets  such as purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company generally performs its recoverability test on a quarterly basis for 
table of contents each of its acquired firms that has experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated principally by an inability to produce base earnings for a period of time 
management believes this is an appropriate time period to evaluate firm performance 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and by the eventual disposition of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the underlying asset  an impairment may exist 
the company measures impairments on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization by comparing a discounted cash flow to the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event that the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge will be recognized for the difference in the consolidated statements of income 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the company generally performs its impairment test on a quarterly basis 
in connection with its quarterly evaluation  management proactively looks for indicators of impairment 
indicators at the company level include but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  loss of key personnel  a decrease in nfp s market capitalization below its book value  and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  the company performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if an impairment is identified  the company measures and records the amount of impairment loss 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the company compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company determined the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow approach 
under this approach  management used certain assumptions in its discounted cash flow analysis to determine the asset s fair value 
these assumptions include but are not limited to a risk adjusted rate that is commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying cash flows  the useful life of the asset  cash flow trends from prior periods  current period cash flows  and management s expectations of future cash flow expectations based on projections or forecasts derived from its understanding of the relevant business prospects  economic or market trends and regulatory or legislative changes which may occur 
management agreement buyout 
from time to time  nfp may seek to acquire an additional economic interest in one of its existing firms through the acquisition of a principals ownership interest in a management company which has been contracted by nfp to manage and operate one of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the acquisition of this ownership interest will be treated for accounting purposes as the settlement of an executory contract in a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship and expensed as part of corporate and other expenses 
gain loss on sale of businesses 
from time to time  nfp has disposed of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
in these dispositions  nfp may realize a gain or loss on the sale of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
results of operations in  revenue declined million  or  largely due to the decline in life insurance revenue as well as due to the challenging economic and market environment 
the company achieved revenue growth of and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
this growth was driven  in and  primarily by the company s acquisitions and in previous years through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth in the revenue of its acquired firms  augmented by the growth of nfpisi and nfpsi 
in  the company s firms had an internal revenue growth rate decline of 
in and  the company s firms had an internal revenue growth rate of and  respectively 
as a measure of financial performance  nfp calculates the internal growth rate of the revenue of the company s firms 
this calculation compares the change in revenue of a comparable group of firms for the same 
table of contents time period in successive years 
nfp includes firms in this calculation at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by the company unless a firm has internally consolidated with another owned firm or has made a sub acquisition that represents more than of the base earnings of the acquiring firm 
with respect to two owned firms that internally consolidate  the combined firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the internal consolidation until the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by nfp of the most recently acquired firm participating in the internal consolidation 
however  if both firms involved in an internal consolidation are included in the internal growth rate calculation at the time of the internal consolidation  the combined firm continues to be included in the calculation after the internal consolidation 
with respect to the sub acquisitions described above  to the extent the sub acquired firm does not separately report financial statements to nfp  the acquiring firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the sub acquisition until the first fiscal quarter beginning one year following the sub acquisition 
sub acquisitions that represent less than of the base earnings of the acquiring firms are considered to be internal growth 
for further information about sub acquisitions  see business acquisition strategy sub acquisitions 
with respect to dispositions  nfp includes these firms up to the time of disposition and excludes these firms for all periods after the disposition 
the calculation is adjusted for intercompany transactions for all periods after december  management believes that the intercompany adjustments made to the internal revenue growth rate for periods after december  does not significantly impact its comparability with prior year periods 
management also monitors acquired firm revenue  commissions and fees expense and operating expense from new acquisitions as compared with existing firms 
for this purpose  a firm is considered to be a new acquisition for the twelve months following the acquisition 
after the first twelve months  a firm is considered to be an existing firm 
within any reported period  a firm may be considered to be a new acquisition for part of the period and an existing firm for the remainder of the period 
additionally  nfpsi and nfpisi are considered to be existing firms but are not included in the internal growth rate figures cited above 
a sub acquisition involves the acquisition by one of the company s firms of a business that is too small to qualify for a direct acquisition by nfp  where the individual running the business wishes to exit immediately or soon after the acquisition  prefers to partner with an existing principal  or does not wish to become a principal 
the acquisition multiple paid for sub acquisitions is typically lower than the multiple paid for a direct acquisition by nfp 
sub acquisitions that do not separately report their results are considered to be part of the firm making the acquisition  and the results of firms disposed of are included in the calculations 
the results of operations discussions set forth below include analysis of the relevant line items on this basis

summary net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million in compared with million in net income as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in net income was mainly due to an increase in the level of impairments of goodwill and intangible assets from million in to million in in addition  gross margin declined and corporate and other expenses and net interest and other increased  which was partially offset by a decline in income taxes 
revenue commissions and fees 
commissions and fees decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in commissions and fees generated from new acquisitions totaled million for the year ended december  and was offset by a million decline in revenue from existing firms 
as the economic environment worsened in the second half of the year  revenue  particularly in life insurance products  declined from prior year levels 
revenue from benefits and executive benefits offset these declines slightly as they remain higher this year compared to the prior year 

table of contents cost of services commissions and fees 
commissions and fees expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in new acquisitions accounted for an increase of million in commissions and fees expense which was offset by a million decline in commissions and fees expense from existing firms 
as a percentage of revenue  commissions and fees expense was in the year ended december  as compared to in the prior year period 
commissions as a percentage of revenue declined during the year primarily due to a shift in revenue mix in to products such as group benefits that typically have lower commissions as a percentage of revenue 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million in compared with million in approximately million of the increase was due to the operating expenses of new acquisitions and approximately million was a result of increased operating expenses at the company s existing firms

liquidity and capital resources the company historically experiences its highest cash usage during the first quarter of each year as balances due to principals and or certain entities they own for management fees and incentive bonuses earned are finalized and paid out  more acquisitions are completed and revenue and earnings decline from the fourth quarter of the prior year 
while acquisitions remain a component of the company s business strategy over the long term  nfp suspended acquisition activity with the exception of certain sub acquisitions in the latter part of in order to conserve cash 
nfp will continue to reassess the market and economic environment 
the increase in cash usage during the first quarter generally requires increased borrowings under nfp s credit facility 
as the year progresses cash flows typically improve as earnings increase and acquisition activities moderate 
with this increase in cash flow nfp generally reduces the borrowings under its credit facility 
because the company suspended acquisition activity in the latter portion of  the historical pattern of an increase in cash usage during the first quarter may change 
as of december   the company had a working capital deficiency 
this deficiency is the result of nfp s classification of its credit facility as a current liability 
nfp s credit facility is structured as a revolving credit facility and matures on august  nfp may elect to pay down its outstanding balance at any time before august  but repayment is not required before that date 
nfp s classification of this obligation as a current liability has been driven by nfp s practice of drawing against the credit line during the year and subsequently repaying significant amounts of the borrowing 
the debt is current in the sense of nfp s practice of frequent draws and repayments  it is not current in that repayment is not required in the next twelve months 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
however  if the company s earnings deteriorate  it is possible that nfp would fail to comply with the terms of its credit facility  such as the consolidated leverage ratio covenant  and therefore be in default under the credit facility 
see borrowings credit facility below 
upon the occurrence of such event of default  the majority of lenders under the credit facility could cause amounts currently outstanding to be declared immediately due and payable 
such an acceleration could trigger cross acceleration provisions under nfp s indenture governing the notes  see borrowings convertible senior notes below

management considers these lawsuits and claims to be without merit and the company intends to defend them vigorously 
in addition  the sellers of firms that the company acquires typically indemnify the company for loss or liability resulting from acts or omissions occurring prior to the acquisition  whether or not the sellers were aware of these acts or omissions 
several of the existing lawsuits and claims have triggered these indemnity obligations 
in addition to the foregoing lawsuits and claims  during  several of the company s firms received subpoenas and other informational requests from governmental authorities  including the new york attorney general s office  seeking information regarding compensation arrangements  any evidence of bid rigging and related matters 
the company has cooperated and will continue to cooperate fully with all governmental agencies 
in march  nfp received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office seeking information regarding life settlement transactions 
one of nfp s subsidiaries received a subpoena seeking the same information 
the company is cooperating fully with the attorney general s investigation 
the investigation  however  is ongoing and the company is unable to predict the investigation s outcome 
management continues to believe that the resolution of these lawsuits or claims will not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
the company cannot predict at this time the effect that any current or future regulatory activity  investigations or litigation will have on its business 
given the current regulatory environment and the number of its subsidiaries operating in local markets throughout the country  it is possible that the company will become subject to further governmental inquiries and subpoenas and have lawsuits filed against it 
the company s ultimate liability  if any  in connection with these matters and any possible future such matters is uncertain and subject to contingencies that are not yet known

contingent consideration and contingent firm employee payments in order to better determine the economic value of the businesses the company has acquired  the company has incorporated contingent consideration  or earnout  provisions into the structure of its acquisitions since the beginning of these arrangements generally provide for the payment of additional consideration to the sellers upon the firm s satisfaction of certain compounded growth rate thresholds over the three year period generally following the closing of the acquisition 
in a small number of cases  contingent consideration may also be payable after shorter periods 
as of december   acquisitions are within their initial three year contingent consideration measurement period 
for acquisitions effective prior to january   contingent consideration is considered to be additional purchase consideration and is accounted for as part of the purchase price of the company s acquired firms when the outcome of the contingency is determined beyond a reasonable doubt

table of contents critical accounting policies business acquisitions  purchase price allocations and intangible assets since the company s formation and through december   it has completed acquisition transactions  including sub acquisitions 
all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and their related net assets and results of operations were included in nfp s consolidated financial statements commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
certain of the acquisitions have provisions for contingent additional consideration based upon the financial results achieved over a multi year period 
this additional consideration is reflected as an increase in goodwill when results are achieved and the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
the company allocates the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired to book of business  management contracts  institutional customer relationships  trade name and goodwill 
the company amortizes intangibles over a year period for book of business  a year period for management contracts and an year period for institutional customer relationships 
intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization and consist of the following as of december  in thousands book of business management contracts trade name institutional customer relationships goodwill total intangible assets and goodwill amortization expense and impairment loss consisted of the following for the years ended december  in thousands book of business management contracts trade name institutional customer relationships goodwill total amortization and impairment loss impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates its amortizing long lived assets and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  long lived assets  such as purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company generally performs its recoverability test on a quarterly basis for each of its acquired firms that have experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated principally by an inability to produce base earnings for a period of time 
management believes this is an appropriate time period to evaluate firm performance 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the 
table of contents carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and by the eventual disposition of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the underlying asset  an impairment may exist 
the company measures impairments on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization by comparing a discounted cash flow to the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event that the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge will be recognized for the difference in the consolidated statements of income 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded impairment losses of million  million  and million  respectively  related to management contract and book of business  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the company generally performs its impairment test on a quarterly basis 
in connection with its quarterly evaluation  management proactively looks for indicators of impairment 
indicators at the company level include but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  loss of key personnel  a decrease in nfp s market capitalization below its book value  and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
indicators of impairment at the reporting unit level may be due to the failure of the firms the company acquires to perform as expected after the acquisition for various reasons  including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the products and services in which a firm specializes  the loss of key clients after acquisition  general economic factors that impact a firm in a direct way  and the death or disability of significant principals 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  nfp performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if an impairment is identified  nfp measures and records the amount of impairment loss 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill 
in the first step  nfp compared the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit 
nfp determined the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow approach 
under this approach  management used certain assumptions in its discounted cash flow analysis to determine the reporting unit s fair value 
these assumptions include but are not limited to a risk adjusted rate that is estimated to be commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying cash flows  the useful life of the asset  cash flow trends from prior periods  current period cash flows  and management s expectation of future cash flow based on projections or forecasts derived from its understanding of the relevant business prospects  economic or market trends and regulatory or legislative changes which may occur 
the company s cash flow projections for each reporting unit were based on five year financial forecasts 
the five year forecasts were based on quarterly financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing its business 
the forecast generally translates into an assumption that the recessionary environment will continue through  stabilize in and resume normalized long term growth rates in the significant assumptions of these five year forecasts included quarterly revenue growth rates for various product categories  quarterly commission expense as a percentage of revenue and quarterly operating expense growth rates 
the future cash flows were tax affected and discounted to present value using a blended discount rate of 
since nfp retains a cumulative preferred position in its reporting units base earnings  nfp assigned a rate of return to that portion of its gross margin that would be represented by yields seen of preferred equity securities  ranging from to 
for retained cash flows retained by nfp in excess of target earnings  and below base earnings  nfp assigned a rate of return  ranging from to 
terminal values for all reporting units were calculated using a gordon growth methodology using a blended discount rate of with a long term growth rate of 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and nfp is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the 
table of contents carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded impairment losses of million  million  and million  respectively  related to goodwill and trade name  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
subsequent to the end of the third quarter of  nfp s stock price declined below net book value per share 
due to the significant deterioration in nfp s stock price  nfp was required to perform a step goodwill impairment test under sfas during the fourth quarter of nfp determined the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow approach 
the assumptions that nfp used for the risk adjusted rate and cash flow forecast are discussed above 
as of december   nfp determined that aggregate fair value of its reporting units was in excess of the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units 
nfp then reconciled the sum of the estimated fair values of its reporting units to the nfp s market value based on its stock price at december   plus a reasonable control premium  which is estimated as that amount that would be received to sell the company as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants 
nfp then considered the following qualitative items that cannot be accurately quantified and are based on the beliefs of management  but provide additional support for the explanation of the remaining difference between the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units and its market capitalization as of december   nfp s market capitalization has been below its book value for a relatively short period of time 
nfp s historical valuation multiples are significantly higher than the multiples as of december  in its capacity as an intermediary of insurance products  nfp s stock price has been influenced by the poor market performance of the insurance industry generally 
nfp was the subject of speculation among certain members of the analyst community regarding its liquidity position and potential bankruptcy 
nfp will continue to monitor both the expected future cash flows of its reporting units and long term trends of its market capitalization for the purpose of assessing the carrying values of its goodwill and intangible assets 
if the stock price remains below the net book value per share  or other negative business factors exist as outlined in sfas  nfp may be required to perform another step analysis and potentially a step analysis  which could result in an impairment of up to the entire balance of the company s goodwill in the first quarter of if nfp performs a step goodwill impairment analysis as defined by sfas  it will also be required to evaluate its intangible assets for impairment under sfas in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  the company applied a hypothetical basis point  basis point and basis point increase in the risk adjusted rate for both  the blended discount rate and for the terminal value discount rate 
this hypothetical increase would have resulted in an additional potential impairment charge of million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december  a decrease in the risk adjusted rate of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in an impairment charge of million 
as referenced above  the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporates quantitative data and qualitative criteria including new information that can dramatically change the decision about the valuation of an intangible asset in a very short period of time 
the timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings 
table of contents could vary if management s conclusions were different 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial position and results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
revenue recognition insurance and annuity commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder

the company also earns fees for the development and implementation of corporate and executive benefit programs as well as fees for the duration that these programs are administered 
asset based fees are also earned for administrative services or consulting related to certain benefits plans 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenue when the following criteria are met the policy application and other carrier delivery requirements are substantially complete  the premium is paid  and the insured party is contractually committed to the purchase of the insurance policy 
carrier delivery requirements may include additional supporting documentation  signed amendments and premium payments 
subsequent to the initial issuance of the insurance policy  premiums are billed directly by carriers 
commissions earned on renewal premiums are generally recognized upon receipt from the carrier  since that is typically when the company is first notified that such commissions have been earned 
the company carries an allowance for policy cancellations  which approximated million  at december   and  respectively  that is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary 
miscellaneous commission adjustments are generally recorded as they occur 
contingent commissions are recorded as revenue when received which  in many cases  is the company s first notification of amounts earned 
contingent commissions are commissions paid by insurance underwriters and are based on the estimated profit and or overall volume of business placed with the underwriter 
the data necessary for the calculation of contingent commissions cannot be reasonably estimated prior to receipt of the commission 
the company earns commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products 
the company also earns fees for offering financial advice and related services 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
in certain cases  incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the assets under management 
some of the company s firms charge flat fees for the development of a financial plan or a flat fee annually for advising clients on asset allocation 
any investment advisory or related fees collected in advance are deferred and recognized as income on a straight line basis over the period earned 
transaction based fees  including performance fees  are recognized when all contractual obligations have been satisfied 
securities and mutual fund commission income and related expenses are recorded on a trade date basis 
some of the company s firms earn additional compensation in the form of incentive and marketing support payments from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  persistency and profitability of business generated by the company for these three sources 
incentive and marketing support revenue is recognized at the earlier of notification of a payment or when payment is received  unless there exists historical data and other information which enable management to reasonably estimate the amount earned during the period
