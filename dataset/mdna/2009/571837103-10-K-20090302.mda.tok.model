the tier and total regulatory capital ratios were unaffected by this adjustment 
see note shareholders equity in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the continued deterioration in the national real estate markets and the economic recession had a negative impact on the corporation s loan and lease portfolio in in addition to a significant increase in nonperforming assets  the amount of loan impairment increased in due to the depressed state of underlying real estate collateral values 
the corporation s construction and development real estate loans  particularly in arizona  the west coast of florida and certain correspondent banking business channels  exhibited the most dramatic increase in stress and impairment 
the increase in stress and impairment and the accelerated disposition of problem assets resulted in net charge offs and provision for loan and lease losses that were significantly higher in when compared to the corporation s historical experience with net charge offs and provision for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to  million in compared to million in  an increase of  million 
on an after tax basis  the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in compared to amounted to approximately  million or per diluted common share

the economic recession and disruption in the capital markets also resulted in an other than temporary investment security loss  write down of a bank owned life insurance policy  unexpected losses in the corporation s wealth management segment and other credit and market related losses 
those write downs and losses were partially offset by gains from the extinguishment of certain debt obligations  securities gains and reversals of litigation accruals associated with the corporation s membership interests in visa and an additional income tax benefit related to prior years 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded severance expense associated with a corporate wide reduction in force 
for the year ended december   these items resulted in a net pre tax loss of million which on an after tax basis amounted to approximately per diluted common share

table of contents according to the american bankers association economic advisory committee  the united states economy declined at the sharpest rate in nearly three decades during the fourth quarter of in light of the economic recession and expectation that will continue to be a difficult year for the global economy and the real estate markets in particular  the corporation is committed to preserving its strong capital base while contributing to the objective of the cpp by continuing to lend to creditworthy consumers and businesses and continuing to provide assistance to customers who are increasingly challenged by the economy 
in order to preserve its strong capital base  the corporation recently announced that it would undertake a series of significant expense reduction initiatives  reduce the quarterly common stock cash dividend to per share and implement several risk management strategies to reduce its exposure to construction and development loans 
through a freeze on filling open positions  attrition and staff reductions  the corporation will reduce its workforce by approximately positions or approximately of its total workforce 
approximately percent of the workforce reductions were completed in the remaining percent are related to operational efficiencies and are expected to be achieved by the end of executive officer and other senior level salaries will be frozen in and awards and benefits under a variety of other programs for employees will be reduced 
however  the corporation s ability to use performance based compensation elements will be severely limited under the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra regulations 
as a result  the human resources and compensation committee of the board of directors will evaluate what actions to take in response to these regulations  including a potential reversal of the freeze on base salary increases 
the board of directors also reduced the annual cash retainer for directors by  and the corporation is reducing a number of other expenses 
these expense initiatives are expected to reduce the corporation s expenses on an annualized  pre tax basis by approximately million 
with respect to credit quality  management expects the prevailing economic and national real estate market conditions will continue in and could extend into the level of net charge offs and the recorded allowance for loan and lease losses are based on management s best estimate of the losses incurred at the measurement date 
management recognizes there are significant estimates in the process and the ultimate losses could be significantly different from those currently estimated 
management expects the provision for loan and lease losses will continue to be higher than its pre historical experience prior to the recession and crisis in the national real estate markets 
rapidly changing collateral values  general economic conditions and numerous other factors continue to create volatility in the housing markets and have increased the possibility that additional losses may have to be recognized with respect to the corporation s current nonperforming assets 
in addition  further deterioration in the economy and national housing markets would likely result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses reported in future quarters 
due to the uncertainty caused by the recession and the resulting rise in unemployment  the crisis in the national real estate markets and numerous other unknown factors that will ultimately affect the timing and amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and the provision for loan and lease losses  it is difficult to develop reliable expectations about nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses that will be recognized in with regard to other expectations for  management expects the net interest margin will continue to experience compression based on current interest rate volatility occurring in the market together with the numerous other factors that impact net interest income and the net interest margin 
commercial and industrial loans contracted slightly in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of commercial and industrial loan growth is expected to be in the low single digits in commercial real estate loan growth for is expected to be relatively modest and consistent with the linked quarter loan growth the corporation experienced in the fourth quarter of management expects construction and development real estate loans will continue to decline

the uncertainty that currently exists in the markets makes it difficult to make an estimate of wealth management revenue in income from continuing operations in amounted to million or per diluted common share compared to income from continuing operations in of million or per diluted common share  a decrease of million or per diluted common share 
the decrease in income from continuing operations in compared to was primarily attributable to the increases in the provision for loan and lease losses

on an after tax basis  the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in compared to amounted to approximately million or per diluted common share

the increased scrutiny of the sub prime lending market is one of the factors that have impacted general market conditions as well as perceptions of the mortgage origination business 
the corporation considers sub prime loans to be those loans with high loan to value  temporary below market interest rates  which are sometimes referred to as teaser rates  or interest deferral options at the time of origination and credit scores that are less than the corporation believes that loans with these characteristics have contributed to the high levels of foreclosures and losses the industry is currently experiencing 
the corporation does not originate sub prime mortgages or sub prime home equity loans or lines for its own portfolio 
however  in and the corporation experienced losses and may continue to have loss exposure from loans to entities that are associated with sub prime mortgage banking 
the corporation does not originate mortgage loans with variable interest only payment plans  commonly referred to as option arms 
option arms may include low introductory interest plans with significant escalation in the rate when the agreement calls for the rate to reset 
the borrower may also be able to fix the monthly payment amount  potentially resulting in negative amortization of the loan 
the corporation does not originate mortgage loans that permit negative amortization 
a negative amortization provision in a mortgage allows the borrower to defer payment of a portion or all of the monthly interest accrued on the mortgage and to add the deferred interest amount to the mortgage s principal balance subject to a stated maximum permitted amount of negative amortization 
once the maximum permitted amount of negative amortization is reached  the borrowers monthly payment is reset and is usually significantly higher than the monthly payment made during periods of negative amortization

larger balances tend to be maintained when overall interest rates are low and smaller balances tend to be maintained as overall interest rates increase 
the decline in average organic interest deposit bearing activity deposits and average organic time deposit reflects the recent increased level of high priced competition to attract deposits and the corporation s decision to maintain its pricing discipline 
the corporation continued to experience shifts in the bank issued deposit mix 
in their search for higher yields in the low interest rate environment  both new and existing customers have been migrating their deposit balances to higher cost deposit products 
management expects this behavior to continue 
wholesale deposits are deposits generated through distribution channels other than the corporation s own banking branches 
the corporation continues to make use of wholesale funding alternatives  especially brokered and institutional certificates of deposit 
the weighted average maturity of brokered and institutional certificates of deposit issued in was years and the weighted average remaining term of outstanding brokered and institutional certificates of deposit at december  was years 
wholesale deposits outstanding at december  cannot be put back to the corporation by investors other than in the case of death or adjudication of incompetence 
these deposits allow the corporation s bank subsidiaries to gather funds across a wider geographic base and at pricing levels considered attractive  where the underlying depositor may be retail or institutional

management currently believes that it has adequate liquidity to ensure that funds are available to the corporation and each of its banks to satisfy their cash flow requirements 
however  if capital markets deteriorate more than management currently expects  the corporation could experience stress on its liquidity position 
the corporation maintains back up liquidity contingency plans for unanticipated market events

throughout  the corporation made greater use of short term borrowings as well as wholesale funding alternatives as previously discussed 
the increased use of short term borrowings and wholesale funding alternatives was in response to the widening of credit spreads and general lack of demand by investors for longer term bank debt that was prevalent throughout during  the corporation called million in aggregate principal amount of various higher cost junior subordinated deferrable interest

during  the corporation called the million junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and the related m i capital trust a trust preferred securities 
this transaction resulted in a loss of million that is reported in loss on termination of debt in the consolidated statements of income and was primarily due to the contractual call premium paid to retire the debentures and trust preferred securities 
during  million of floating rate federal home loan bank fhlb advances were extinguished and the pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges on the fhlb advances were terminated 
the gain realized from these transactions was primarily due to the acceleration of the fair value adjustments for the interest rate swaps that were recorded in other comprehensive income

there were many factors that affected the corporation s net interest margin in some of these factors included the movement of new and existing deposits into higher cost products  loan growth that exceeded the corporation s ability to generate lower cost bank issued deposits  a volatile interest rate environment  higher credit spreads and liquidity premiums for term financing and elevated levels of nonaccrual and renegotiated loans 
acquisitions for cash  the buyback of common shares and the purchase of bank owned life insurance reduced net interest income and were additional sources of contraction to the net interest margin 
management continues to believe that margin contraction is more likely than margin expansion 
in a very low interest rate environment  earning assets will continue to re price downward 
however  many deposit categories have re priced to their floors 
as a result  the net interest margin fte as a percent of average earning assets could continue to have modest downward pressure in the near term 
net interest income and the net interest margin percentage can vary and continue to be influenced by loan and deposit growth  product spreads  pricing competition in the corporation s markets  prepayment activity  future interest rate changes  levels of nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and various other factors

nonaccrual loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
nonperforming loans and leases consist of nonaccrual  troubled debt restructured loans  which the corporation refers to as renegotiated  and loans and leases that are delinquent days or more and still accruing interest 
nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned oreo 
the corporation employs a credit review and approval process to help ensure that the amount of nonperforming assets on a long term basis is maintained within the overall framework of acceptable levels of credit risk 
in addition to the negative impact on net interest income and credit losses  nonperforming assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts and the expenses of carrying oreo 
the corporation had a significant increase in nonperforming assets in and compared to prior years 
the increase has been primarily attributable to real estate related loans in areas that were previously experiencing substantial population growth and increased demand for housing such as arizona and florida 
the corporation s higher growth markets have been disproportionately affected by the excess real estate inventory and deterioration in the national real estate markets as the economy deteriorated into recession 
the corporation has worked aggressively to isolate  identify and assess its underlying loan and lease portfolio credit quality and has developed and continues to develop strategies to reduce and mitigate its loss exposure 
during  the corporation sold million of nonperforming loans 
in addition  at december   the corporation held million of nonaccrual loans that are intended to be sold 
generally  loans that are days or more past due as to interest or principal are placed on nonaccrual 
exceptions to these rules are generally only for loans fully collateralized by readily marketable securities or other relatively risk free collateral and certain personal loans 
a loan may be placed on nonaccrual when management makes a 
table of contents determination that the facts and circumstances warrant such classification irrespective of the current payment status 
at december   approximately million or of the corporation s total nonperforming loans and leases were days or less past due 
in total  approximately million or of the corporation s total nonperforming loans and leases were less than days past due at december  the amount of cumulative charge offs recorded on the corporation s nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  was approximately million or of the unpaid principal balance of the affected nonaccrual loans and of the unpaid principal balance of its total nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  at december   nonperforming loans and leases amounted to  million or of consolidated loans and leases compared to million or of consolidated loans and leases at december  and million or of consolidated loans and leases at december  nonaccrual loans and leases are the largest component of nonperforming loans and leases and amounted to  million or of consolidated loans and leases at december  compared to million or of consolidated loans and leases at december  and million or at december  at december   renegotiated loans and leases amounted to million

approximately million or of the renegotiated real estate and home equity loans at december  were loans secured by real estate located in arizona 
at december   approximately million or of the renegotiated real estate and home equity loans were construction and development loans 
the corporation recognizes that the current recession and declining real estate values have resulted in many customers being far more leveraged than prudent and in a very difficult financial position 
potentially distressed homeowners are identified in advance  and proactively offered assistance 
in order to avoid foreclosure in the future  the corporation has restructured loan terms for certain qualified borrowers that have demonstrated the ability to make the restructured payments for a specified period of time 
the corporation s foreclosure abatement program includes several options  including stipulation plans  loan modifications  term extensions  short term forbearance options and reduced rates that can be used  as necessary and applicable  to reduce contractual payments 
in addition  the corporation has implemented a day foreclosure moratorium on all owner occupied residential loans for customers who agree to work in good faith to reach a successful repayment agreement 
the moratorium applies to loans in all the corporation s markets and extends through march  the corporation expects nonaccrual loans will initially increase until the loan terms are restructured 
upon restructuring  nonacrrual loans will decline and the balance of renegotiated loans will increase 
the corporation expects the balance of renegotiated loans will continue to increase in future quarters 
the balance of renegotiated loans at the end of consisted primarily of the renegotiated portion of the franklin credit management corp 
franklin loan  which was million at december  that balance was reclassified out of renegotiated loans in the first quarter of in the second half of  franklin experienced declining cash collections  rising delinquencies and higher than expected servicing expenses 
these factors indicated that there was additional impairment associated with franklin 
as a result  charge offs totaling million were taken in the third and fourth quarters of these charge offs represented the remaining subordinated tranches of franklin 
at december   the corporation s exposure to the accruing portion of franklin amounted to million

this housing related stress exists in all of the corporation s markets and includes both core and acquired loans 
more specifically  the corporation s construction and development real estate loans exhibited the most dramatic increase in stress and impairment 
the increase in stress and impairment was most notable in the geographical markets of the west coast of florida and arizona and  the correspondent banking business channel which includes construction and development real estate loans that are geographically dispersed

the corporation s construction and development real estate loans exhibited the most dramatic increase in impairment 
in addition  commercial loans whose performance is dependent on the housing market  such as the franklin loan discussed above  were adversely affected by the deterioration in the national real estate markets 
deteriorating conditions in the us housing market became evident in the first half of  accelerated sharply in the second half of the year and continued the accelerated pace in these deteriorating conditions have been fueled and extended  in part  by rising unemployment due to the recession 
as a result  an increasing number of borrowers have been unable to either refinance or sell their properties and consequently have defaulted or are very close to defaulting on their loans 
in this stressed housing market that is experiencing increasing delinquencies and rapidly declining real estate values  the adequacy of collateral securing the loan becomes a much more important factor in determining expected loan performance 
the corporation continuously re assessed  and continues to re assess the timeliness and propriety of appraisals for collateral dependent loans especially in volatile real estate markets such as arizona 
the corporation uses a variety of sources  such as recent sales of loans and sales of oreo  to validate the collateral values used to determine the amount of loss exposure at the measurement date 
in addition  the corporation has re evaluated and continues to re evaluate the expected timing and amount of expected cash flows required to service debt under various scenarios for both nonperforming loans and performing loans considered to be at a higher risk of going into nonperforming status 
in many cases  rapidly declining real estate values have resulted in the determination that the collateral was insufficient to cover the recorded investment in the loan 
these factors resulted in the corporation s loan and lease portfolio experiencing significantly higher incidences of default and a significant increase in loss severity in 
table of contents net charge offs in were concentrated in three areas which the corporation refers to as business channels 
net charge offs for the arizona business channel amounted to million  net charge offs for the west coast of florida business channel amounted to million and net charge offs for the correspondent banking business channel amounted to million 
the aggregate net charge offs for these three business channels amounted to million or of total net charge offs for the year ended december  included in net charge offs were the net charge offs related to the loans that were sold during the twelve months ended december  as previously discussed  real estate related loans  especially construction and development real estate loans were the primary contributors to the increase in nonperforming loans and leases and net charge offs in real estate related loans made up the majority of the corporation s nonperforming loans and leases at december  historically  the corporation s loss experience with real estate loans has been relatively low due to the sufficiency of the underlying real estate collateral 
in a stressed real estate market such as currently exists  the value of the collateral securing the loans has become one of the most important factors in determining the amount of loss incurred and the appropriate amount of allowance for loan and lease losses to record at the measurement date 
the likelihood of losses that are equal to the entire recorded investment for a real estate loan is remote 
however  in many cases  rapidly declining real estate values have resulted in the determination that the estimated value of the collateral was insufficient to cover all of the recorded investment in the loan which has required significant additional charge offs 
declining collateral values have significantly contributed to the elevated levels of net charge offs and the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses that the corporation experienced in recent quarters 
the amount of cumulative charge offs recorded on the corporation s nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  was approximately million or of the unpaid principal balance of the affected nonaccrual loans and of the unpaid principal balance of its total nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  these charge offs have reduced the carrying value of these nonaccrual loans and leases which reduced the allowance for loan and lease losses required at the measurement date 
consistent with the credit quality trends noted above  the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to  million in by comparison  the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
the provision for loan and lease losses is the amount required to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses at the required level after considering charge offs and recoveries 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  compared to at december  and at december  the following table presents the allocation of the consolidated allowance for loan and lease losses at december   as well as selected comparative years allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses s december  december  december  amount percent of loans and leases to total loans and leases amount percent of loans and leases to total loans and leases amount percent of loans and leases to total loans and leases balance at end of period applicable to commercial  financial agricultural real estate residential mortgage commercial mortgage personal lease financing total 
table of contents december  december  amount percent of loans and leases to total loans and leases amount percent of loans and leases to total loans and leases balance at end of period applicable to commercial  financial agricultural real estate residential mortgage commercial mortgage personal lease financing total management expects prevailing economic and national housing market conditions to continue in  possibly extending into the level of net charge offs and the recorded allowance for loan and lease losses are based on management s best estimate of the losses incurred at the measurement date 
management recognizes there are significant estimates in the process and the ultimate losses could be significantly different from those currently estimated 
management expects the provision for loan and lease losses will continue to be higher than its pre historical experience 
rapidly changing collateral values  general economic conditions and numerous other factors continue to create volatility in the housing markets and have increased the possibility that additional losses may have to be recognized with respect to the corporation s current loan and lease portfolio 
in addition  further deterioration in the economy and national housing markets would likely result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses reported in future quarters 
due to the uncertainty caused by the recession  the crisis in the national real estate markets and numerous other unknown factors that will ultimately affect the timing and amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and the provision for loan and lease losses  it is difficult to develop reliable expectations about nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan and lease losses that will be recognized in the corporation will continue to proactively manage its problem loans and nonperforming assets and be aggressive to isolate  identify and assess its underlying loan and lease portfolio credit quality 
the corporation has developed and continues to develop strategies  such as selective sales of nonperforming loans and restructuring loans to qualified borrowers  to mitigate its loss exposure 
construction and development loans tend to be more complex and may take more time to attain a satisfactory resolution 
depending on the facts and circumstances  acquiring real estate collateral in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans may continue to be the best course of action to take in order to mitigate the corporation s exposure to loss

the corporation invests in these boli policies to provide an efficient form of funding for long term retirement and other employee benefits costs 
therefore  the corporation s boli policies are intended to be long term investments to provide funding for future payment of long term liabilities 
the corporation records these boli policies at each policy s respective cash surrender value  with changes recorded in bank owned life insurance revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
certain boli policies have a stable value agreement through either a large  well rated bank or multi national insurance carrier that provides limited cash surrender value protection from declines in the value of each policy s underlying investments 
during the fourth quarter of  the value of the investments underlying one of the 
table of contents corporation s boli policies declined significantly due to disruptions in the credit markets  widening of credit spreads and illiquidity in the securities market 
these factors caused the decline in the cash surrender value to exceed the protection provided by the stable value agreement

 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas adopts an aggregate view of goodwill and bases the accounting for goodwill on the units of the combined entity into which an acquired entity is integrated which are referred to as reporting units 
a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or one level below an operating segment 
sfas provides guidance for impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized 
other than goodwill  the corporation does not have any other intangible assets that are not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
based on the test performed at the end of the fourth quarter of  the wealth management segment  which consists of the trust  private banking and brokerage reporting units  and the capital markets reporting unit did not have indicators of potential impairment based on the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
based on their estimated fair values  the commercial and community banking segments and the national consumer banking reporting unit had indicators of potential impairment and were subjected to the second step of goodwill impairment testing 
the deterioration in the national real estate markets  the economic recession and the disruption in the capital markets had the greatest adverse affect on these segments and reporting units
