the selig product line was merged into the zep industrial and institutional product offering during fiscal year  and redundant products were eliminated 
we have licenses for two other brands  the armorall professional brand and a line of cleaners under the rubbermaid commercial brand 
we licensed the armorall professional name from the clorox company in to produce and sell a premium line of cleaning products for the transportation end market 
in  we licensed and developed a line of cleaners under the rubbermaid commercial brand name that we currently sell primarily to wal mart and menards 
industry according to market research that we utilize  the united states commercial  industrial  and institutional cleaning chemicals market is an estimated billion market 
we believe we are one of the top four market leaders  which together hold slightly less than of the total market share 
we estimate that our greater than market share trails only that of ecolab inc and johnsondiversey holdings  inc 
the market is highly fragmented and is served by hundreds of regional and niche participants who sell either directly to end users or through distributors 
approximately two thirds of the market is currently served through distributors while one third of the market is currently served through direct sales 
we are a market leader in the direct sales channel and the significant majority of our historical revenues have come from this channel 
in general  the commercial  industrial  and institutional end market enjoys growth consistent with gdp due to favorable end market demographics  increasing government regulations  health and safety concerns  and consumer demand for cleanliness 
in october  we announced our entrance into the industrial distribution channel through the forging of strategic alliances with several world class distributors 
we anticipate that significant revenue growth can be achieved as we execute on our long term strategy of entering and penetrating the billion industrial distribution channel 
these efforts  we anticipate  could produce of our revenues 
additionally  based on internal and industry research  we estimate the total size of the retail cleaning chemicals market is approximately billion 
this market is served through channels including grocery  mass merchandisers  home improvement  drug  and other specialty retailers 
we primarily sell through the home improvement channel  which only serves a portion of the overall retail cleaning chemicals market 

table of contents while consumption of cleaning and maintenance products is somewhat discretionary  in health driven  sophisticated markets such as north america and western europe  health and safety regulations and customer expectations can somewhat buffer demand downturns 
increased legislation regulating food  health  and safety requires increased frequency of use  thus fueling increases in demand 
health and safety regulations are also shrinking the pool of available chemicals 
together  these trends are driving demand and development of improved product formulations and application methods 
we believe end users in our markets are beginning to demand more effective and efficient products 
additionally  many corporate buyers are increasing centralized corporate buying activities and consolidating their respective purchases and suppliers 
these demand factors should offer opportunities for broad product line suppliers like us  with national presence and support  formulation expertise  and distribution capabilities

our compensation model is primarily commission based 
net sales are largely dependent on the hiring  training  and retention of our commissioned sales representatives 
our sales and service organization covers the united states  canada  italy  belgium  luxemburg  the netherlands and certain other smaller markets 
manufacturing we manufacture products at six facilities located in the united states  canada  the netherlands  and italy 
the three united states facilities produce approximately of our manufactured product  the canadian facility produces approximately  and the two european facilities produce approximately 
certain finished goods purchased from contract manufacturers and finished goods suppliers supplement the manufactured product line 
sales of outsourced product  which is product manufactured for us by third party suppliers  currently account for approximately of our net sales 
table of contents volume 
outsourced product is predominately manufactured in the united states 
management does not believe the loss of any one supplier of outsourced product would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
distribution products sold to commercial  industrial  and institutional end markets are shipped from more than strategically located branch warehouses throughout north america and europe  which are supplied directly from our production facilities  and by one large distribution center in atlanta  georgia 
products sold to home improvement retailers are distributed nationwide from another facility located in georgia 
our products are primarily delivered through common and local carriers 
research and development we employ approximately chemists and technical support personnel who develop product systems that provide comprehensive solutions for broad based customer applications and who work in our technical services area supporting both our sales representatives and customers 
efforts to enhance existing formulations by utilizing new raw materials or combinations of raw materials have resulted in both new and improved products 
special emphasis has been placed on the development of environmentally preferable products based on renewable and environmentally preferred raw materials  such as the continued expansion of our greenlink product line  introduction of products for the automotive market under the enviroedge name  and the launch of the provisions food service cleaning product line  which is composed of biodegradable detergents and cleansers ideally suited for the growing food segment 
technical expertise is employed to incorporate proven technologies into new applications 
our research and development expense for the three years ended august   has ranged between approximately million and million 
competition the cleaning and maintenance solutions industry is highly competitive 
overall  competition is fragmented in the commercial  industrial  and institutional end markets  with numerous local and regional operators selling directly to customers  distributors  and a few national competitors 
many of these competitors offer products in some  but not all  of the markets we serve 
competition is based primarily on brand name recognition  price  product quality  and customer service 
competitors in the commercial  industrial  and institutional end market include but are not limited to ecolab inc  johnsondiversey holdings  inc  arch chemicals  inc  rpm international  inc  nch corporation  rochester midland corporation  and state chemical manufacturing company 
many companies compete within the broader retail market for cleaning chemical products including but not limited to church dwight co  inc  procter and gamble  wd company  reckitt benckiser plc  sc johnson sons  inc  sunshine makers  inc  and the clorox company 
we also compete in the home improvement channel with pest control companies such as bayer  ag  spectrum brands  inc  and the scott s company 
furthermore  barriers to entry and expansion in the industry are low  which may lead to additional competitive pressure in the future 
patents  licenses  and trademarks we own or have licenses to use various domestic and foreign patents and trademarks related to our formulations and products  processes  and businesses 
these intellectual property rights  particularly our trademarks and formulations relating to our products  are important factors for our businesses 
while patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position  no single patent or patent application is material to us 

table of contents to protect these proprietary rights  we rely on copyright  patent  trade secret  and trademark laws 
despite these protections  unauthorized parties may attempt to infringe on our intellectual property 
our management is not aware of any such material unauthorized use or of any pending claims where we do not have the right to use any intellectual property material to our business 
raw materials the key raw materials we use in our products are surfactants  polymers and resins  fragrances  water  solvents and other petroleum based materials  and packaging materials 
we purchase most raw materials on the open market and rely on third parties for the sourcing of some finished goods 
accordingly  the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of the above mentioned raw materials or the sourcing of finished goods 
due to the mix of purchases raw materials  components parts  and finished goods  timing of price increases  and other economic and competitive forces within the supply chain  it is not possible to determine the financial impact of future changes in the market price of these raw materials 
we do not engage in significant commodity hedging transactions for raw materials  though we have committed and will continue to commit to purchase certain materials for specified periods of time 
many of the raw materials we use are petroleum based and  therefore  subject to the availability and price of oil or its derivatives 
significant increases in the prices of our products due to increases in the cost of raw materials could have a negative effect on demand for products and on profitability 
while we have generally been able to pass along these increases in cost in the form of higher selling prices for our products over time  some customer conservation may have a negative impact on our sales volume 
there can be no assurance that future disruptions in either supply or price of these materials will not negatively affect future results 
we constantly monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality  service  and price 
our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers 
a reduction in the number of suppliers could cause increased risk associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and finished goods 
seasonality and cyclicality our business exhibits some seasonality  with net sales being affected by weather and the annual budget cycles of major customers 
historically  due to this seasonality and the number of available selling days  the second half of our fiscal year is much stronger in terms of sales  earnings  and cash flow than the first half 
in addition  our net sales are dependent on the retail  wholesale  and industrial markets and demand for these markets is generally associated with gdp  unemployment levels  industrial production  and housing construction in the united states 
economic downturns and the potential decline in key markets and demand for cleaning and maintenance products may have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating income 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  transportation  and disposal of hazardous substances and solid and hazardous wastes  and to the remediation of contaminated sites 
permits and environmental controls are required for certain of our operations to limit air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation by issuing authorities 
we will incur capital and operating costs relating to environmental compliance on an ongoing basis 
environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years  and the cost of responding to future changes may be 
table of contents substantial 
while we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to remediate violations of such laws and regulations  particularly in connection with acquisitions of existing operating facilities  or to comply with changes in  or stricter or different interpretations of  existing laws and regulations 
such costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
employees as of august   we had approximately  employees  including  in the united states  in canada  and in europe 
of our approximately  employees  we estimate that were members of eight unions in the united states and europe 
approximately of zep s total work force is covered by collective bargaining agreements 
collective bargaining agreements representing a de minimis amount less than of the company s work force will expire within one year

risk factors risks related to our business our results can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost or availability of materials used in our manufacturing processes 
the key raw materials we use in our products  which are surfactants  polymers and resins  fragrances  water  and solvents and other petroleum based materials  and packaging materials  are subject to price fluctuations 
further  we do not engage in significant commodity hedging transactions for raw materials  
table of contents though we have committed and will continue to commit to purchase certain materials for specified periods of time 
significant increases in the prices of our products due to increases in the cost of raw materials or packaging materials could have a negative effect on demand for products and on profitability 
many of the raw materials that we use are energy dependent  and  therefore are subject to the availability and price of energy related inputs such as oil and natural gas 
failure to effectively manage future increases in the costs of these materials could adversely affect our ability to achieve operating margins acceptable to stockholders 
furthermore  there are a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials  packaging materials  and finished goods 
our profitability and volume could be negatively impacted by limitations inherent within the supply chain of certain of these materials  including competitive conditions  governmental issues  legal issues  natural disasters  and other events that could impact both the availability and price of the materials 
we face significant competition and may face more significant competition in the future 
the cleaning and maintenance solutions industry is highly competitive 
overall  our competition is fragmented in the commercial  industrial  and institutional end market  with numerous local and regional operators selling directly to customers  distributors  and a few national competitors

we also compete in the home improvement channel with pest control companies such as bayer  ag  spectrum brands  inc  and the scott s company 
furthermore  barriers to entry and expansion in the industry are low  which may lead to additional competitive pressure in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that change in the source or intensity of competitive pressure in the industry will not result in reduced market share that could negatively impact our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
we are subject to a broad range of environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and we may be exposed to substantial environmental  health  and safety costs and liabilities 
we are subject to a broad range of environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these laws and regulations impose increasingly stringent environmental  health  and safety protection standards and permitting requirements regarding  among other things  air emissions  wastewater storage  treatment  and discharges  the use and handling of hazardous or toxic materials  waste disposal practices  and the remediation of environmental contamination and working conditions for our employees 
some environmental laws  such as superfund  the clean water act  and comparable laws in us states and other jurisdictions world wide  impose joint and several liability for the cost of environmental remediation  natural resource damages  third party claims  and other expenses  without regard to the fault or the legality of the original conduct  on those persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these laws may impact the manufacture and distribution of our products and place restrictions on the products we can sell in certain geographical locations 
the costs of complying with these laws and regulations  including participation in assessments and remediation of contaminated sites and installation of pollution control facilities  have been  and in the future could be  significant 
in addition  these laws and regulations may also result in substantial environmental liabilities associated with divested assets  third party locations  and past activities 
we 
table of contents have established reserves for environmental remediation activities and liabilities where appropriate 
however  the cost of addressing environmental matters including the timing of any charges related thereto cannot be predicted with certainty  and these reserves may not ultimately be adequate  especially in light of potential changes in environmental conditions  changing interpretations of laws and regulations by regulators and courts  the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions  the risk of governmental orders to carry out additional compliance on certain sites not initially included in remediation in progress  our potential liability to remediate sites for which provisions have not previously been established and the adoption of more stringent environmental laws 
such future developments could result in increased environmental costs and liabilities and could require significant capital and other ongoing expenditures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  the failure to comply with our obligations under the environmental laws and regulations could subject us to administrative  civil  or criminal penalties  obligations to pay damages or other costs  and injunctions or other orders  including orders to cease operations 
in addition  the presence of environmental contamination at our properties could adversely affect our ability to sell property  receive full value for a property  or use a property as collateral for a loan 
in june  we reached a final resolution of the investigation by the united states department of justice the doj of certain environmental issues at our primary manufacturing facility located in atlanta  georgia 
in connection with this resolution  we are subject to a three year probation period that incorporates a compliance agreement with the united states environmental protection agency the epa 
under the compliance agreement  we are required to maintain an enhanced compliance program 
this matter is not expected to lead to a material loss of business  any disruption of production  or materially higher operating costs 
however  in the event of our material breach of the compliance agreement  those consequences could occur 
we are currently a party to federal and state administrative proceedings arising under federal and state laws enacted for the protection of the environment where a state or federal agency or a private party alleges that hazardous substances generated by zep have been discharged into the environment and a state or federal agency is requiring a cleanup of soil and or groundwater pursuant to federal or state superfund laws 
in each of these proceedings in which zep has been named as a party that allegedly generated hazardous substances that were transported to a waste site owned and operated by another party  either zep is one of many other identified generators who have reached an agreement on the allocation of costs for cleanup among the various generators and zep s potential liability is not material  zep has been identified as a potential generator and the sites have been remediated by the epa or by a state for a cost that is not material  or other generators have cleaned up the site and have not pursued a claim against zep and zep s liability  if any  would not be material 
our property on seaboard industrial boulevard is the only active site involving property which we own and where we have been named as a potentially responsible party 
we and the current and former owners of adjoining properties have agreed to share the expected costs and responsibilities of implementing an approved corrective action plan  submitted in  under the georgia hazardous response act hsra to periodically monitor property along a nearby stream for a period of five years ending in december the georgia environmental protection division the epd is reviewing the monitoring program and will determine if additional monitoring is necessary and for what period of time 
subsequently  in connection with the doj investigation described earlier  we and the epa each analyzed samples taken from certain sumps at the seaboard facility 
the sample results from some of the sump tests indicated the presence of certain hazardous substances 
as a result  we notified the epd and conducted additional soil and groundwater studies pursuant to hsra 
we are continuing to negotiate with the epd on the scope of the corrective action plan we submitted to address the subsurface contamination north of seaboard industrial boulevard  and have executed a consent order with the epd covering this remediation 

table of contents in january  the epa issued a notice of violation and document request regarding the use and management of certain trench drains at the seaboard production facility as well as assorted minor waste labeling issues 
the company executed a consent order with the epa in march that resolved this matter 
resolution involved the remittance of a penalty and modification of certain manufacturing practices  neither of which had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in may  we accrued an undiscounted pre tax liability of million representing our best estimate of costs associated with voluntary subsurface remediation  primarily to remove contaminants from soil underlying one of our manufacturing facilities  and other related environmental issues 
while over approximately the next three years  we could expend an amount ranging up to million on these efforts  our best estimate of voluntary remediation costs continues to be million 
to date  we have expended approximately million of the million reserve established in may further sampling  engineering studies  changes in regulatory requirements and or final resolution of the proposed consent order could cause us to revise the current estimate 
we believe that additional expenditures after three years of remediation may be necessary and that those expenditures  based on currently available information  could range up to an additional million during the subsequent twenty five year period 
it may be appropriate to capitalize certain of the expenditures that may be incurred in this twenty five year period 
we arrived at the current estimates on the basis of studies prepared by independent third party environmental consulting firms 
the actual cost of remediation will vary depending upon the results of additional testing and geological studies  the success of initial remediation efforts in the first five years addressing the most significant areas of contamination  the rate at which site conditions may change  and the requirements of the epd 
we may develop unexpected legal contingencies or lose insurance coverage 
we are subject to various claims  including legal claims arising in the normal course of business 
as of august   we were insured up to specified limits for certain types of claims with a self insurance retention of million per occurrence  including toxic tort and other product liability claims  and are fully self insured for certain other types of claims  including environmental  product recall  commercial disputes  patent infringement and errors and omissions 
based on our historical claims experience  our comprehensive general liability self insurance retention limits have been increased to million per occurrence for claims incurred after august  we establish reserves for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for such claims 
in the event of unexpected future developments  it is possible that the ultimate resolutions of such matters  if unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain current levels of insurance coverage for all matters that are currently insured for costs that we consider reasonable 
our insurance coverage is negotiated on an annual basis  and our insurance policies in the future may have coverage exclusions that would cause our costs for claims to rise 
we use hazardous materials and chemicals in our manufacturing processes which could result in claims against us 
we use a variety of hazardous materials and chemicals in our manufacturing processes and in connection with maintenance work on our manufacturing facilities 
because of the nature of these substances or related residues  we may be liable for certain costs  including  among others  costs for health related claims or removal or re treatment of such substances 
in addition  although we have developed environmental  health  and safety programs for our employees  including measures to reduce employee exposure to hazardous substances  and conduct regular assessments at our facilities  we may be involved in claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injury as a result of 
table of contents occupational exposure to substances or other hazards at our current or former facilities 
due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation  it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of any such claims or lawsuits that may arise 
if any such claims and lawsuits  individually or in the aggregate  were resolved against us  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
if our products are improperly manufactured  packaged  or labeled or become adulterated  we may need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 
we may need to recall some of our products if they are improperly manufactured  packaged  or labeled or if they become adulterated 
our quality control procedures relating to the raw materials  including packaging  that we receive from third party suppliers as well as our quality control procedures relating to our products after our products are formulated and packaged may not be sufficient 
we have previously initiated product recalls  and widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall  the destruction of product inventory  and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time 
we may also be liable if the use of any of our products causes injury  and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us 
a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity  damage to our reputation  and a loss of consumer confidence in our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we rely on a variety of third party service providers for transportation of our products between our facilities and from our facilities to our customers 
we rely upon third party carriers for safe and timely delivery of our shipments 
as a result  we are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors that are beyond our control  including labor difficulties  inclement weather  terrorist activity  and increased fuel costs 
furthermore  mishandling of our products by the third party carriers could subject us to product liability claims or other costs and liabilities 
disruptions at our most significant facilities could affect our profitability and harm our relationship with significant customers 
over the past three years  nearly half of our manufactured products were produced at our atlanta  georgia seaboard facility 
in addition  our emerson  georgia facility packages the majority of our products sold to retail end markets 
we also maintain a national distribution center in atlanta  georgia 
a material disruption of the operations of any of these facilities due to a natural disaster  work stoppages  power outages  or any other cause could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain desired levels of profitability and volume and could affect our relationship with our most significant customers 
we may be unable to sustain significant customer relationships 
relationships forged with customers  including the home depot  which represented approximately   and of our total net sales during the three fiscal years ended august   respectively  are directly impacted by our ability to deliver high quality products and service 
we do not have a written contract obligating the home depot to purchase our products 
the loss of or substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by the home depot would harm our sales and profitability 

table of contents we may not be able to attract and retain sufficiently qualified sales representatives and other personnel 
our success is dependent upon the continued service of our highly skilled workforce and our ability to attract and retain new personnel 
the challenge to attract top talent is a formidable one given the competition for such talent within our markets 
in particular  we have historically experienced substantial turnover in sales representatives who have less than two years experience 
this turnover in our sales force on a monthly basis increases our hiring and training expenses and can interrupt continuity with some of our customers 
in addition  we are continuing to expand our sales efforts into alternative sales channels  including wholesale distribution through our zep professional product line 
widespread sales of our products through wholesale distribution could reduce the sales of our products by sales representatives in certain regions  which could lead to the loss of sales representatives and customers  as well as disputes over the terms of sales and commission agreements 
we also have instituted stricter performance standards for our sales representatives 
failure to meet these standards could result in loss of employment for the sales representative  loss of customers and potential for lawsuits 
significant employee turnover and failure to maintain a qualified workforce  including qualified sales representatives  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we are unable to protect our information and telecommunication systems against disruptions or failures  our operations could be disrupted 
we are increasingly dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems  including the internet  to process  transmit and store electronic information 
in particular  we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders  applying cash receipts  determining reorder points and placing purchase orders on our suppliers  making cash disbursements  blending chemicals  and conducting digital marketing activities  data processing  and electronic communications among our locations and between company personnel and our customers and suppliers 
we also depend on our telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers 
we have experienced system disruptions in the past that have adversely affected our ability to effectively manage our operations and service our customers 
future system disruptions  security breaches  or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or may result in financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 
we may not properly execute  or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from  our ongoing strategic transformation initiatives  information technology  or other initiatives 
our success is partly dependent upon properly executing  and realizing cost savings or other benefits from  our ongoing strategic transformation initiatives a discussion of which is provided within item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  information technology  and other initiatives 
these initiatives are primarily designed to make us more efficient in the sales  manufacture  and distribution of our products 
these initiatives are often complex  and a failure to implement them properly may  in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits  result in an interruption to our sales  manufacturing  logistics  customer service  or accounting functions 
furthermore  we have invested a significant amount of capital into a number of these initiatives  which might have been more efficiently used if the full cost savings or benefits are not realized 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including the requirement to reduce the book value of some assets 

table of contents we may pursue future growth through strategic acquisitions or joint ventures from which we may not receive the benefits that we anticipate 
as part of our business growth strategy  we may pursue acquisitions 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions due to the risk inherent in such activity  including unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement by the seller  difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company within our existing operations or in maintaining uniform standards  loss of key employees of the acquired company  the failure to achieve anticipated synergies  and strains on management and other personnel time and resources to evaluate  negotiate and integrate acquisitions 
our failure to properly manage these risks could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues  causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected 
we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash  capital stock  notes and or assumption of indebtedness 
to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient in any instance  we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing  which involves its own risks 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot give assurance of our ability to pay dividends in the future or the amount of any dividends 
we intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders 
even though we have paid a regular quarterly dividend since our second full quarter of stand alone operations and do not expect change with respect to dividend payment activity  we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k and any risk factors in our subsequent securities and exchange commission filings 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and their payment and amount will depend on our earnings  our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future or that the distributions will be made in amounts similar to our historic distributions 
future offerings of debt securities  which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation  and future offerings of equity securities  which would dilute our existing shareholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
on october   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission that  upon being declared effective  will allow zep to raise up to an aggregate of million 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or additional offerings of equity securities  including senior or subordinated notes and series of preferred stock or common stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and preferred stock  if any  and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing 
table of contents stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
preferred stock  if issued  could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their share holdings in us 
we are subject to risks related to our operations outside the united states 
we have operations outside the united states 
net sales outside the united states represented approximately of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended august  furthermore  as of august   approximately of our products were manufactured outside the united states 
in addition to the risks that are common to both our us and us operations  we face risks related to our foreign operations such as foreign currency fluctuations  unstable political  economic  financial  and market conditions  trade and currency restrictions  increases in tariffs and taxes  high levels of inflation  restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the united states  greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles  higher social and legal costs  and adverse interpretations of foreign laws and regulations 
some of these risks have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows in the future 
global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
unfavorable economic conditions  including the impact of recessions in the united states and throughout the world  may continue to negatively affect the company s business and financial results 
we are particularly sensitive to economic downturns that affect the transportation  food processing and services  manufacturing  government and housekeeping markets  all of which have been affected by the recent global recession 
these economic conditions could negatively impact i demand for our products by end users of such products  including a shifting purchasing patterns to lower cost options  ii our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers and iii the ability of certain suppliers to fill our orders for raw materials or other goods and services 
a prolonged recession  particularly one that affects the end user markets listed set forth above  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition  and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
if we are unable to keep and protect our intellectual property rights  our ability to compete may be negatively impacted 
the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our brand names 
we own  or have licenses to use  all of the material trademark and trade name rights used 
table of contents by us in connection with the packaging  marketing  and distribution of our major products both in the united states and in other countries where our products are principally sold 
in addition  we possess trade secret product formulations and other product information  some of which are patented  which are competitively sensitive 
intellectual property protection is important to our business 
although most of our trademarks are registered in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we operate  we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the costs required to protect our intellectual property rights may be substantial 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert our intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated  circumvented  or challenged 
other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our brand names in the marketplace 
any infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a diversion of our time and resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise 
finally  others may claim that our business or products infringe on their intellectual property rights 
any failure by us to protect our trademarks and trade names  or any adverse judgment with respect to infringement of others intellectual property rights  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our business could suffer in the event of a work stoppage or increased organized labor activity 
as of august   approximately of our  employees were members of eight unions in the united states and europe 
while we consider our relations with employees to be generally good  we cannot assure you that we will not experience work stoppages  strikes  or slowdowns in the future 
in addition  we outsource to third parties the manufacturing of certain of our products that currently account for approximately of our net sales volumes  and we cannot assure you that these third parties will not experience work stoppages  strikes or slowdowns in the future 
a prolonged work stoppage  strike  or slowdown at any of our facilities or those of our third party suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  we cannot assure you that  upon expiration of any of our existing collective bargaining agreements  new agreements will be reached without union action or that any new agreement will be on terms satisfactory to us 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our non union facilities will not become subject to labor union organizing efforts 
if any current non union facilities were to unionize  we would incur increased risk of work stoppages and possibly higher labor costs 
we have incurred indebtedness in the normal course of business  which subjects us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a million revolving credit facility that will mature in revolving credit facility 
on october   we entered into a three year  million loan and security agreement secured by our trade accounts receivable that replaced a similar asset backed securitization facility we allowed to expire in the normal course during october in addition  we are responsible for million in industrial revenue bonds due in these financing arrangements contain customary restrictions  covenants  and events of default 
the terms of these financing arrangements impose and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions  provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities 
we were in compliance with all debt related financial covenants as of august  each of these financing arrangements is discussed further within note of notes to consolidated and combined financial statements 

table of contents access to capital markets necessary to support current operations and future growth plans may not be available 
as of august   we had additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
we entered into four interest rate swap arrangements during the fourth quarter of fiscal year effectively swapping the variable interest rate associated with million of borrowings made under our revolving credit facility for fixed rates ranging from to 
we reduced our debt  net of cash  position approximately during fiscal year to million  and based on our current cash on hand  current financing arrangements  and current projections of cash flow from operations  management believes that we will be able to meet the liquidity needs of our current business over the next twelve months 
on october   we entered into the above mentioned three year  million loan and security agreement 
while we have recently demonstrated an ability to secure additional capital  in the future  market conditions could substantially increase the cost associated with accessing capital markets and ultimately constrain our ability to borrow money  which could impact future profitability 
moreover  depending upon market conditions  we may be unable to access the equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all 
while we have relationships with six banks through our outstanding debt arrangements  the failure of any one or more of those banks or other financial institutions may impact the company s ability to borrow money to finance its operating activities 
local  state  and federal governments are placing increasingly stringent regulations on the security of chemical plant locations  the transportation of hazardous chemicals  and the environmental impact of chemical production 
growing public and political attention has been placed on protecting critical infrastructure  including the chemical industry  from security threats 
terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concern regarding the security of chemical production and distribution 
in addition  local  state  and federal governments have enacted  and may in the future enact  increasingly stringent regulations that impact the security of chemical plant locations  the transportation of hazardous chemicals  and the environmental impact of chemical production  which could result in higher operating costs and interruptions in normal business operations 
the market price for our common stock may be volatile  and you may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock has in the recent past been  and may in the future be  highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
this volatility may occur for many reasons  including for reasons unrelated to our performance  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions  or negative announcements by our customers  competitors  or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as general economic and industry conditions 
additional factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall include  but are not limited to  the following variations in our quarterly results  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new products or services or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors  recruitment or departure of key personnel or key groups of personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders  
table of contents the gain or loss of significant customers  the disruption of supply and or price of key raw materials  significant changes in regulatory requirements  increased litigation resulting from product or employee claims  adverse developments concerning environmental matters  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our stock  and market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers  and the economy as a whole 
risks related to our spin off from acuity brands we have a limited operating history as an independent public company and may be unable to operate as profitably as a stand alone company as we operated as a segment of acuity brands 
we have only operated as an independent public company since october  prior to the distribution  the businesses that comprised each of acuity brands and zep were under one ultimate parent  and each of those businesses was able to rely  to some degree  on the earnings  assets  and cash flows of the others for capital requirements 
after the spin off  we are able to rely only on our specialty chemicals business for such requirements 
while the specialty chemicals business was a profitable segment of acuity brands  we cannot assure you that  as an independent company  profits will continue at the same level 
historical financial information may be of limited relevance 
the historical financial information preceding the distribution and included in this annual report on form k does not reflect our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows in the future and only estimates our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows had we operated as a separate stand alone public entity during the periods presented 
the financial information included herein does not reflect any changes that may have occurred or may occur in our funding and operations as a result of the spin off 
failure of the spin off to qualify as a tax free transaction could result in substantial liability 
acuity brands has received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that  among other things  the spin off including certain related transactions qualifies as tax free to acuity brands  us  and acuity brands stockholders for united states federal income tax purposes under section and related provisions of the internal revenue code 
although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the internal revenue service  if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect  then acuity brands will not be able to rely on the ruling 
moreover  the internal revenue service will not rule on whether a distribution of shares satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax free treatment under section of the internal revenue code 
rather  the private letter ruling is based upon representations by acuity brands that those requirements have been satisfied  and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling 
acuity brands and zep inc have received an opinion from king spalding llp  then counsel to acuity brands and us  to the effect that  with respect to the requirements referred to above on which the internal revenue service will not rule  those requirements will be satisfied 
the opinion is based on  among other things  certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by acuity 
table of contents brands and us which  if untrue or incomplete in any material respect  could jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion 
the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts  and the internal revenue service or the courts may not agree with the opinion 
if the spin off fails to qualify for tax free treatment  a substantial corporate tax would be payable by acuity brands  measured by the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the shares of our common stock on the date of the spin off and acuity brands adjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock on the date of the spin off 
the corporate level tax would be payable by acuity brands 
however  we have agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify acuity brands for this tax liability 
this indemnification obligation  if triggered  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  under the applicable treasury regulations  each member of acuity brands consolidated group at the time of the spin off including us is severally liable for such tax liability 
even if the spin off otherwise qualifies as tax free  acuity brands nevertheless could incur a substantial corporate tax liability under section e of the internal revenue code  if percent or more of our stock or the stock of acuity brands were to be acquired as part of a plan or a series of related transactions that includes the distribution 
for this purpose  any acquisitions of the stock of acuity brands or of our stock that occur within two years before or after the spin off are presumed to be part of such a plan  although acuity brands may be able to rebut that presumption 
if such an acquisition of the stock of acuity brands or of our stock triggers the application of section e  acuity brands would recognize taxable gain as described above  but the spin off would generally remain tax free to the acuity brands stockholders 
if acquisitions of our stock trigger the application of section e  we would be obligated to indemnify acuity brands for the resulting corporate level tax liability 
this indemnification obligation would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and rights plan and the tax disaffiliation agreement may discourage takeovers 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain anti takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive or that may discourage a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our board of directors 
in particular  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws classify our board of directors into three groups  so that stockholders elect only one third of the board each year  permit stockholders to remove directors only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least of our voting shares  permit a special stockholders meeting to be called only by a majority of the board of directors  do not permit stockholders to take action except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders  require stockholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting  permit our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board may determine  require the vote of the holders of at least of our voting shares for stockholder amendments to our bylaws  and require  for the approval of a business combination with stockholders owning or more of our voting shares  the vote of at least of our voting shares not owned by such stockholder  
table of contents unless certain fair price requirements are met or the business combination is approved by our continuing directors 
the preferred stock purchase rights attached to our shares of common stock  in effect  prevent a person or group from acquiring more than of the total number of our common stock outstanding at any time without obtaining prior approval from the company s board of directors  to be granted at the board s sole discretion 
in addition  delaware law generally restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our common stock  unless the transaction or the acquisition is approved in advance by our board of directors 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law  and the preferred stock purchase rights could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  even though a majority of our stockholders may consider such proposals  if effected  desirable 
such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our board of directors 
moreover  these provisions could diminish the opportunities for stockholders to participate in certain tender offers  including tender offers at prices above the then current market value of our common stock  and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts or speculation 
if the spin off is considered part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which or more of our stock is acquired  the spin off will be taxable to acuity brands but not to its stockholders under section e of the internal revenue code 
for this purpose  any acquisitions of our stock that occur within two years after the spin off subject to certain exceptions including an exception for public trading will be presumed to be part of such a plan  although acuity brands may be able to rebut that presumption 
under the tax disaffiliation agreement  we have agreed to indemnify acuity brands for any tax liability to acuity brands under section e of the code that results from acquisitions of our stock 
this provision of the tax disaffiliation agreement may have the effect of discouraging or preventing an acquisition of our company or a disposition of our business

each of our six manufacturing facilities is owned by the company except for the italy and canada locations  which are leased 
additionally  we own branch and storage facilities in massachusetts  illinois and washington 
we lease sales offices and storage facilities throughout north america and europe 
our facilities  which are adequate for our current needs  are in good operating condition and are suitable for their current uses 
item legal proceedings legal proceedings we are subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business 
we are self insured up to specified limits for certain types of claims  including product liability  and are fully self insured for certain other types of claims  including environmental  product recall  and patent infringement as part of the distribution agreement with acuity brands 
based on information currently available  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
however  in the event of unexpected future developments  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters  if unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows in future periods 
we establish reserves for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for such claims 
however  we cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  transportation  and disposal of hazardous substances and solid and hazardous wastes  and to the remediation of contaminated sites 
permits and environmental controls are required for certain of our operations to limit air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation by issuing authorities 
we will incur capital and operating costs relating to environmental compliance on an ongoing basis 
environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years  and the cost of responding to future changes may be substantial 
while we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to remediate violations of such laws and regulations  particularly in connection with acquisitions of existing operating facilities  or to comply with changes in  or stricter or different interpretations of  existing laws and regulations 
such costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in june  we reached a final resolution of the investigation by the united states department of justice the doj of certain environmental issues at our primary manufacturing facility located in atlanta  georgia 
in connection with this resolution  we are subject to a three year probation period that incorporates a compliance agreement with the united states environmental protection agency the epa 
under the compliance agreement  we are required to maintain an enhanced compliance program 
this matter is not expected to lead to a material loss of business  any disruption of production  or materially higher operating costs 
however  in the event of our material breach of the compliance agreement  those consequences could occur 
we are currently a party to federal and state administrative proceedings arising under federal and state laws enacted for the protection of the environment where a state or federal agency or a private party alleges that hazardous substances generated by zep have been discharged into the environment and a state or federal agency is requiring a cleanup of soil and or groundwater pursuant to federal or state superfund laws 
in each of these proceedings in which zep has been named as a party that allegedly generated hazardous substances that were transported to a waste site owned and operated by another party  either zep is one of many other identified generators who have reached an agreement on the allocation of costs for cleanup among the various generators and zep s potential liability is not material  zep has been identified as a potential generator and the sites have been remediated by the epa or by a state for a cost that is not material  or other generators have cleaned up the site and have not pursued a claim against zep and zep s liability  if any  would not be material 
our property on seaboard industrial boulevard is the only active site involving property which we own and where we have been named as a potentially responsible party 
we and the current and former owners of adjoining properties have agreed to share the expected costs and responsibilities of implementing an approved corrective action plan  submitted in  under the georgia hazardous response act hsra to periodically monitor property along a nearby stream for a period of five years ending in december the georgia environmental protection division the epd is reviewing the monitoring program and will determine if additional monitoring is necessary and for what period of 
table of contents time 
subsequently  in connection with the doj investigation described earlier  we and the epa each analyzed samples taken from certain sumps at the seaboard facility 
the sample results from some of the sump tests indicated the presence of certain hazardous substances 
as a result  we notified the epd and conducted additional soil and groundwater studies pursuant to hsra 
we are continuing to negotiate with the epd on the scope of the corrective action plan we submitted to address the subsurface contamination north of seaboard industrial boulevard  and have executed a consent order with the epd covering this remediation 
in january  the epa issued a notice of violation and document request regarding the use and management of certain trench drains at the seaboard production facility as well as assorted minor waste labeling issues 
the company executed a consent order with the epa in march that resolved this matter 
resolution involved the remittance of a penalty and modification of certain manufacturing practices  neither of which had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in may  we accrued an undiscounted pre tax liability of million representing our best estimate of costs associated with voluntary subsurface remediation  primarily to remove contaminants from soil underlying one of our manufacturing facilities  and other related environmental issues 
while over approximately the next three years we could expend an amount ranging up to million on these efforts  our best estimate of voluntary remediation costs continues to be million 
to date  we have expended approximately million of the million reserve established in may further sampling  engineering studies  changes in regulatory requirements and or final resolution of the proposed consent order could cause us to revise the current estimate 
we believe that additional expenditures after three years of remediation may be necessary and that those expenditures  based on currently available information  could range up to an additional million during the subsequent twenty five year period 
it may be appropriate to capitalize certain of the expenditures that may be incurred in this twenty five year period 
we arrived at the current estimates on the basis of studies prepared by independent third party environmental consulting firms 
the actual cost of remediation will vary depending upon the results of additional testing and geological studies  the success of initial remediation efforts in the first five years addressing the most significant areas of contamination  the rate at which site conditions may change  and the requirements of the epd
