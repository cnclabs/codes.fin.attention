item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations  and the critical accounting policies of franklin covey co 
also referred to as the company  we  us  our  and franklincovey  unless otherwise indicated and subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which contain additional information regarding the accounting policies and estimates underlying the company s financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in item of this report on form k 
franklincovey is a leading global provider of execution  leadership  and personal effectiveness training with over employees worldwide that delivered principle based curriculum and effectiveness tools to our customers 
we operate globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service 
to achieve this level of service  we operate four regional sales offices in the united states  wholly owned subsidiaries in australia  japan  and the united kingdom  and contract with licensee partners who deliver our curriculum and provide services in over other countries and territories around the world 
our business to business service utilizes our expertise in training  consulting  and technology that is designed to help our clients define great performance and execute at the highest levels 
we also provide clients with training in management skills  relationship skills  and individual effectiveness  and can provide personal effectiveness literature and electronic educational solutions to our clients as needed 
historically  our solutions included products and services that encompassed training and consulting  assessment  and various application tools that were generally available in electronic or paper based formats 
our products and services were available through professional consulting services  public workshops  retail stores  catalogs  and the internet at www 
franklincovey 
com  and our best known offerings in the marketplace have included the franklincovey planner and a suite of individual effectiveness and leadership development training products based on the best selling book the habits of highly effective people 
over the past several years  the strategic focus of our consumer solutions business unit csbu  which was focused primarily on sales of our products  and our organizational solutions business unit osbu  which was focused on the development and delivery of training  consulting  and related services  changed significantly 
as a consequence of these changes in strategic direction  we determined that the extent of overlap between our training and consulting offerings and our products had diminished 
after significant analysis and deliberation  it became apparent that these business units would be able to operate more effectively as separate companies  each with clear and distinct strategic objectives  market definitions  and competitive products and services 
this conclusion persuaded us to sell substantially all of the operations of the csbu 
during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended august   we completed the sale of the csbu to a newly formed entity  franklin covey products  llc and reported a gain of million from the transaction 
franklin covey products  llc was formed with the objective of expanding the worldwide sales of franklin covey products through proprietary channels and through third party retailers as governed by a comprehensive license agreement with the company 
following the sale of the csbu  we have been able to focus our full resources on the continued expansion of our training  consulting  content rich media  and thought leadership businesses 
our business now primarily consists of training  consulting  assessment services  and products to help organizations and individuals achieve superior results by focusing on and executing on top priorities  building the capability of knowledge workers  and aligning business processes 
the sale of csbu had a significant impact on our financial statements since the csbu and corresponding product sales represented a substantial portion of our total sales  and the business dynamics of a training 
table of contents company are considerably different than a consumer products company 
based on relevant accounting literature  we were unable to present the operational results of the csbu in a discontinued operations format  which makes comparisons of fiscal financial results to fiscal results difficult 
the key factors that influence our operating results include the number of organizations that are active customers  the number of people trained within those organizations  the availability of budgeted training spending at our clients and prospective clients  which is significantly influenced by general economic conditions  and our ability to manage operating costs necessary to develop and provide meaningful training and related products to our clients 
our fiscal year ends on august  and unless otherwise indicated  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to the twelve month periods ended august    and results of operations overview of the fiscal year ended august  our results of operations in fiscal were primarily affected by the sale of csbu and by the prevailing economic conditions in the united states and the rest of the world 
during fiscal  the economies of many countries suffered through their worst performance in recent decades as the poor health of many financial institutions  especially in the united states  curtailed lending and overall economic growth throughout the year 
these economic conditions forced many of our clients and potential clients to reduce budgeted spending for training or to temporarily defer the delivery of training services 
however  during our fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to see improvement in corporate spending and the delivery of programs and training materials improved over previous quarters in fiscal we anticipate that this improvement will continue during fiscal  but we do not anticipate returning to pre recession sales levels until sometime in fiscal or later 
following the sale of csbu assets  we spent much of fiscal defining the business model for the new structure of the company  and we initiated numerous cost savings and organizational change efforts  including movement of certain functions to field operations to improve efficiency  headcount reductions  reduction of information technology spending  and other initiatives designed to bring our cost structure in line with our projected business model 
however  as a result of these initiatives  we recorded additional costs in fiscal related to severance  asset impairments  and other areas that we believe will provide ongoing benefits in future periods 
for the year ended august   our consolidated sales decreased to million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in sales was primarily due to the sale of the csbu combined with effects of a weakened economy on training sales 
for the year ended august   we reported a loss from operations of million compared to income from operations of million  including the gain from the sale of csbu  in fiscal our loss before taxes was million compared to income before taxes of million in the prior year 
we recorded a million income tax benefit in fiscal compared to a million income tax provision in fiscal  primarily due to reduced pre tax income 
the following information is intended to provide an overview of the primary factors that influenced our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  sales performance our consolidated sales decreased million compared to the prior year 
the vast majority of the decline was attributable to the sale of our csbu operations and the corresponding reduction in product sales 
of the million decline  million  or percent  was attributable to product sales from the csbu 
sales delivered through the organizational solutions business unit osbu  which are comparable to the prior year and consist primarily of training and consulting service sales in our domestic and international divisions  decreased million due to sales declines in both domestic and international 
table of contents operations 
our leasing revenues increased million  which was primarily attributable to new sublease contracts for space at our corporate headquarters campus 
gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily due to decreased sales as described above 
however  our gross margin  which is gross profit stated as a percentage of sales  remained relatively consistent with the prior year at percent compared to percent in the prior year 
operating costs our operating costs  excluding the gain on the sale of the csbu  decreased by million compared to fiscal  which was primarily due to the sale of the csbu 
decreased operating expenses consisted primarily of a million decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses  a million increase in impaired asset charges  a million decrease in depreciation expense  and a million increase in amortization expense 
further details regarding these items can be found in the comparative analysis of fiscal compared to fiscal as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income before income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations year ended august  training and consulting services products leasing total sales training and consulting services products leasing total cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative gain on sale of csbu assets gain on sale of manufacturing facility restructuring costs impairment of assets depreciation amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes segment review prior to the fiscal sale of our consumer solutions business unit csbu  the company had two operating segments the organizational solutions business unit osbu and the csbu 
following the sale  our operations constitute one reportable segment 
however  to improve comparability  the sales information presented in the table below reflect fiscal and fiscal operating results based upon 
table of contents the previously defined segments 
the following is a description of these segments  their primary operating components  and their significant business activities organizational solutions business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of strategic execution  productivity  leadership  sales force performance  and communication training and consulting solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of our domestic sales force  public programs  and certain international operations 
the domestic sales force is responsible for the sale and delivery of our training and consulting services in the united states and canada 
our international sales group includes the financial results of our directly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
consumer solutions business unit this business unit was primarily focused on sales to individual customers and small business organizations and included the results of our domestic retail stores  consumer direct operations primarily internet sales and call center  wholesale operations  international product channels in certain countries  and other related distribution channels  including government product sales and domestic printing and publishing sales 
the csbu results of operations also included the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although csbu sales primarily consisted of products such as planners  binders  software  totes  and related accessories  virtually any component of our leadership  productivity  and strategy execution solutions may have been purchased through the csbu channels 
the following table sets forth sales data by category and for our operating segments for the periods indicated

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales training and consulting services we offer a variety of training courses  training related products  and consulting services focused on leadership  productivity  strategy execution  sales force performance  trust  and effective communications that are provided both domestically and internationally through our sales force or through international licensee operations 
our consolidated training and consulting service sales decreased by million compared to the prior year  which was attributable to unfavorable performance in both the domestic and international divisions 
we believe that the decrease in sales was primarily due to unfavorable economic conditions  which eroded business confidence and led to decreased training budgets and the deferral of scheduled programs 
the effects of the economic downturn were widespread and led to economic contraction and reduced sales in many countries where we operate through direct offices or through our licensees 
these conditions led to the following results in our domestic and international divisions domestic our domestic training and consulting sales decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in domestic sales was primarily due to reduced public seminar sales resulting from the decision to reduce the number of events scheduled during the year and from the decision to license the delivery rights of certain public programs to a third party  which resulted in the company recording a licensee fee from these programs rather than the gross sale amount previously recorded  a decrease in the number of on site events given during the year  with a significant portion of the decrease occurring in our sales performance group  a decrease in our specialized seminar events  and lower books and audio sales as prior year sales were favorably impacted by the release of the leader in me book by dr 
stephen r 
covey 
our training manual sales to our independent facilitator partners training conducted by clients using their certified trainers only decreased slightly from the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our customer loyalty offerings and speed of trust programs during the year 
during the quarter ended february   we acquired coveylink worldwide llc coveylink  which has developed training courses and materials based upon the book entitled the speed of trust by stephen mr covey 
we believe that continued economic deterioration in the united states during the fiscal year ended august  was a significant contributing factor to decreased training and consulting sales during the year 
however  during our fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to see improvement in corporate spending and the delivery of programs and training materials improved over previous quarters in fiscal we anticipate that this improvement will continue during fiscal international international sales decreased million compared to the fiscal year ending august  the decrease in international sales was primarily due to decreased sales at our directly owned offices in japan and the united kingdom  lower royalty revenue recognized from our licensees  decreased international product sales in japan  and the unfavorable impact of translation of foreign sales to the united states dollar 
decreased sales in japan and the united kingdom were primarily due to the continued weak economic conditions in those countries 
the translation of foreign sales to united states dollars had a net million unfavorable impact on our consolidated sales during the fiscal year ended august  product sales consolidated product sales  which were primarily sold through our csbu channels  declined million compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of our csbu during the fourth quarter of fiscal remaining product sales primarily consist of products and related accessories sold in japan by our directly owned office in that country 

table of contents leasing sales leasing sales increased million primarily due to the addition of new leasing contracts that are generated from various arrangements to lease office space at our salt lake city  utah headquarters campus 
gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold or the cost of services provided 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
prior to the sale of csbu assets in fiscal  we recorded the costs associated with operating our retail stores  call center  and internet site as part of our consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses 
therefore  our consolidated gross profit may not be comparable with the gross profit of other companies that include similar costs in their cost of sales 
our consolidated gross profit decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to decreased product sales resulting from the sale of the csbu 
our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  was percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
our training and consulting services gross margin was percent compared to percent in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased licensee royalty revenues  which have virtually no corresponding cost of sales  increased royalty costs on certain programs sold  and increased amortization of capitalized curriculum development costs 
gross margin on product sales decreased to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the csbu  which eliminated virtually all of our domestic product sales 
remaining product sales consist primarily of product sales made in japan  on which the gross margin decreased compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to adjustments to our inventory reserves in japan 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to the sale of the csbu  which reduced consolidated sg a by approximately million compared to the prior year  a million decrease in compensation costs resulting from lower sales and corresponding reductions to commissions and other variable compensation elements  a million decrease in advertising costs  primarily related to a decrease in the number of public programs held  million of reduced travel and conference costs  primarily due to the cancellation of our annual sales and delivery conference and focused cost cutting measures  and the favorable impacts of our restructuring plan on various areas of our operations 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased warehousing costs that were previously charged to csbu cost centers  and million of increased share based compensation costs due to reversals of share based compensation expense in the prior year that did not repeat in fiscal following the sale of our csbu in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring plan that reduced the number of our domestic regional sales offices  decentralized certain sales support functions  and significantly changed the operations of our canadian subsidiary 
we continued these restructuring efforts in fiscal and believe that they will have long term benefits to our operating results 
due to prevailing economic conditions  we have also initiated numerous other cost savings efforts designed to reduce our overall operating costs and improve profitability 
while we expect these efforts to have a significant impact on our cost structure  the outcome of these efforts may not reduce our costs as quickly or as effectively as planned 

table of contents restructuring costs following the sale of our csbu  we initiated a restructuring plan that reduces the number of our domestic regional sales offices  decentralizes certain sales support functions  and significantly changes the operations of our canadian subsidiary 
the restructuring plan is intended to strengthen the remaining domestic sales offices and reduce our overall operating costs  and this effort continued into fiscal during fiscal we expensed million for anticipated severance costs necessary to complete the restructuring plan 
the remainder of the restructuring plan is expected to be completed during fiscal impairment of assets based on the terms of the sale of csbu assets  we were entitled to receive a million adjustment for working capital delivered on the closing date of the sale and to receive million as reimbursement for specified costs necessary to complete the transaction 
payment for these costs was originally due in january  but we extended the due date of the payment at franklin covey products request and obtained a promissory note from franklin covey products for the amount owed  plus accrued interest 
at the time we received the promissory note from franklin covey products  we believed that we could obtain payment for the amounts owed  based on prior year performance and forecasted financial performance in however  the financial position of franklin covey products deteriorated significantly late in fiscal and the deterioration accelerated subsequent to august  as a result of this deterioration  the company reassessed the collectibility of the promissory note 
based on revised expected cash flows and other operational issues  we determined that the promissory note should be impaired at august  accordingly  we recorded a million impaired asset charge and reversed million of interest income that was recorded during fiscal from the working capital settlement and reimbursable transaction cost receivables 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the csbu 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we impaired certain software costs due to the decision to replace our primary general ledger accounting system in fiscal and recorded an additional million depreciation charge 
we also recorded impairment charges totaling million for two software applications that did not function as anticipated and were written off during fiscal amortization consolidated amortization expense increased by million compared to the prior year due to the acquisition of coveylink  which closed in fiscal we anticipate that amortization expense will total million in fiscal income taxes our income tax benefit for fiscal was million compared to a million provision in fiscal the income tax benefit was primarily due to a pre tax loss recognized in fiscal compared to pre tax income for the same period of the prior year 
our effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent was lower than statutory combined rates primarily due to foreign withholding taxes for which we cannot utilize a foreign tax credit  the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program  and actual and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries for which we also cannot utilize foreign tax credits 
interest income and expense interest income our interest income decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced cash balances compared to the prior year and a reduction of interest rates on our depository accounts 
interest expense interest expense remained consistent with the prior year and was reflective of borrowings on our line of credit facility and payments made on our building lease financing obligation during fiscal 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales training and consulting services our consolidated training and consulting service sales increased by million compared to the prior year 
training and consulting service sales performance in fiscal was primarily influenced by the following factors in our domestic and international osbu operations domestic our domestic training sales in fiscal were flat compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower sales from our sales performance group  public programs  and our book and audio divisions 
decreased sales from these groups were partially offset by increased sales from our combined geographical and vertical market sales offices and by increased sales from specialized seminar events 
during fiscal  sales through our direct sales offices improved over the prior year as acceptance of our core product offerings  which includes the seven habits of highly effective people  leadership great leaders  great teams  great results  and the disciplines of execution  continued to strengthen 
in fiscal  we closed our canadian office and assigned the canadian sales personnel to domestic regions 
the sales data presented above reflect the transfer of canadian sales from the international division to the domestic division for all periods presented 
four of our seven domestic offices generated increased year over year sales in fiscal  and sales of our training materials to our client facilitators improved compared to the prior year 
revenue from the number of training and consulting days delivered increased two percent over the prior year as our average revenue per day received increased 
the number of training days delivered  however  declined three percent compared to fiscal international international sales decreased million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
sales from our three remaining directly owned foreign offices as well as from licensee royalty revenues increased compared to the prior year as each of these units achieved double digit growth 
however  these increases were offset by the elimination of sales from our wholly owned subsidiary in brazil and our training operations located in mexico 
we sold these operations to external licensees during fiscal and we now only receive royalty revenue from their operations based upon gross sales 
the conversion of these operations to licensees had a million unfavorable impact on our international sales but improved our income from these operations compared to the prior year 
the translation of foreign sales to united states dollars had a million favorable impact on our consolidated sales as foreign currencies strengthened against the united states dollar during fiscal product sales consolidated product sales  which primarily consist of planners  binders  totes  software  and related accessories that are primarily sold through our csbu channels  declined million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decline in overall product sales during fiscal was primarily due to the sale of our csbu operations in fiscal combined with the following performance in csbu delivery channels prior to the effective date of the sale 
retail stores prior to the sale of the csbu operations  our retail sales decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced traffic in our retail locations  which was partially due to a significant increase in the number of wholesale outlets that sold our products and competed directly against our retail stores  reduced demand for technology and related products  and fewer store locations  which had a million impact on retail sales 
our retail store traffic  or the number of consumers entering our retail locations  declined by approximately percent on a comparable basis for stores which were open during the comparable periods and resulted in decreased sales of core products eg planners  binders  totes  and accessories 
due to declining demand for electronic handheld planning products  during late fiscal we decided to exit the low margin handheld 
table of contents device and related electronics accessories business  which reduced retail sales by million compared to the prior year 
these factors combined to produce a percent decline in year over year comparable store sales versus the prior year 
consumer direct sales through our consumer direct channels primarily the internet and call center decreased primarily due to a decline in the number of customers visiting our website and a decline in the number of orders that are being processed through the call center 
visits to our website decreased from the prior year by approximately percent 
declining consumer orders through the call center continues a long term trend and decreased by approximately percent compared to the prior year  which we believe was partially the result of a transition of customers to our other product channels 
wholesale sales through our wholesale channel  which included sales to office superstores and other retail chains  decreased primarily due to the transition of a portion of our wholesale business to a new distributor and the timing of sales as the new distributor built inventories 
csbu international this channel includes the product sales of our directly owned international offices in canada  the united kingdom  mexico  and australia 
product sales were flat through these channels compared to the prior year before the sale of csbu 
other csbu other csbu sales consist primarily of domestic printing and publishing sales and building sublease revenues 
the decline in other csbu sales was primarily due to decreased external printing sales  which was partially offset by a million increase in sublease revenue 
gross profit for fiscal  our consolidated gross profit decreased to million compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of csbu and declining product sales during fiscal prior to the sale of csbu 
our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  improved to percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal the slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the continuing shift toward increased training and consulting sales  as a percent of total sales  since training and consulting sales generally have higher margins than our product sales 
training and consulting service sales increased to percent of total sales during fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
during fiscal  our training and consulting services gross margin decreased to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the slight decrease was primarily attributable to increased amortization of capitalized curriculum costs during the fiscal year  which was partially offset by increased licensee royalty revenues  which have virtually no corresponding cost of sales 
for the fiscal year ended august   our gross margin on product sales was percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative consolidated sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  compared to the prior year excluding the gain on the sale of the csbu assets in fiscal and a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility in fiscal 
the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to the fiscal sale of the csbu  which reduced csbu sg a expenses by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the prior year  a million decrease in share based compensation primarily due to the determination that no shares will be awarded under our fiscal or fiscal long term incentive plans and the corresponding reversal of share based compensation expense from those plans  a million decrease in bonuses and commissions based on sales performance in the osbu during the year  and smaller decreases in sg a spending in 
table of contents various other areas of our operations 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in associate compensation primarily resulting from the payment of awards and bonuses subsequent to the sale of the csbu  a million increase in promotional costs in our osbu  which were primarily comprised of increased spending for greatness summit programs for our clients and increased spending on public programs promotional materials  a million increase in legal fees primarily related to the epicrealm litigation  and a million increase in retail store closure costs that were primarily incurred in connection with the buyout of two leases 
gain on sale of csbu assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold substantially all of the assets of our csbu to franklin covey products for million in cash  subject to adjustments for working capital on the closing date of the sale  which was effective july  on the date of the sale closing  the company invested approximately million to purchase a percent voting interest in franklin covey products  made a million priority capital contribution with a percent return  and will have the opportunity to earn contingent license fees if franklin covey products achieves specified performance objectives 
we recognized a gain of million on the sale of the csbu assets and according to specific accounting guidance  we deferred a portion of the gain equal to our investment in franklin covey products 
we will recognize the deferred gain over the life of the long term assets acquired by franklin covey products or when cash is received for payment of the priority contribution 
restructuring costs following the sale of our csbu  we initiated a restructuring plan that reduces the number of our domestic regional sales offices  decentralizes certain sales support functions  and significantly changes the operations of our canadian subsidiary 
the restructuring plan is intended to strengthen the remaining domestic sales offices and reduce our overall operating costs 
during fiscal we expensed million for anticipated severance costs necessary to complete the restructuring plan 
impairment of assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we analyzed the expected future revenues and corresponding cash flows expected to be generated from our the habits of highly effective people interactive program and concluded that the expected future revenues  less direct costs  were insufficient to cover the carrying value of the capitalized development costs 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million impairment charge to write this program down to its net realizable value 
depreciation and amortization consolidated depreciation expense increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in our depreciation expense in fiscal was primarily due to the acceleration of million of depreciation on a payroll software module that had a revision to its estimated useful life as we decided to outsource our payroll services and an impairment charge totaling million for software that did not function as anticipated and was written off 
depreciation expense in the prior year also included an impairment charge totaling million that we recorded to reduce the carrying value of one of our printing presses to be sold to its anticipated sale price 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we determined that it was appropriate to reclassify depreciation expense on our subleased corporate campus from cost of sales to depreciation expense 
the depreciation expense reclassified from product cost of sales totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets totaled million for the fiscal years ended august  and interest income and expense interest income our interest income decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced cash balances compared to the prior year and a reduction of interest rates on our depository accounts 
interest expense interest expense remained consistent with the prior year and was reflective of borrowings on our line of credit facility and payments made on our building lease financing obligation during fiscal 
table of contents income taxes our income tax provision for the fiscal year ended august  totaled million compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal of approximately percent was higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program and withholding taxes on royalty income from foreign licensees 
since the company is currently utilizing net operating loss carryforwards  we were unable to reduce our domestic tax liability through the use of foreign tax credits  which normally result from the payment of foreign withholding taxes 
preferred stock dividends our preferred stock dividends in fiscal declined million compared to fiscal the decrease in preferred stock dividends was due to the redemption of all remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock during the third quarter of fiscal quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for the years ended august  and the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
while closing the first quarter of fiscal  we identified errors due to improper accounting for certain product sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the improper calculation of inventory reserves from late fiscal through the fourth quarter of fiscal in the financial statements of our directly owned subsidiary in japan 
we assessed the materiality of these errors in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
and determined that the errors were immaterial to previously reported amounts contained in our periodic reports and we have corrected these errors in subsequent periodic filings 
the quarterly information presented below for fiscal has been adjusted to reflect the correction of these errors 
year ended august  november february may august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense restructuring costs impairment of assets depreciation amortization loss from operations loss before income taxes net loss loss per share attributable to common shareholders basic diluted 
table of contents year ended august  december march may august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense gain on sale of csbu restructuring costs impairment of assets depreciation amortization income loss from operations income loss before income taxes net income loss earnings loss per share available to common shareholders basic diluted our quarterly results of operations in fiscal reflected seasonal trends that were primarily the result of customers who renew their franklincovey planners on a calendar year basis 
domestic training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
the fourth quarter of fiscal reflects the sale of csbu assets  which reduced sales and corresponding costs associated with the operations of the csbu 
we recognized a million gain on the sale of the csbu assets  which had a favorable impact on that period s operating results 
in future periods we expect that our quarterly sales will be less seasonal since they will not include product sales that are sold primarily during november  december  and january 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new offerings  the addition of new organizational customers  and the elimination of underperforming offerings 
liquidity and capital resources summary at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at august  and our net working capital current assets less current liabilities decreased to a deficit of million at august  compared to million of working capital at august  the change in working capital was primarily due to the utilization of substantially all of the net cash proceeds from the sale of csbu to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock in a modified dutch auction tender offer 
the tender offer closed  fully subscribed  prior to august  and we recorded a million liability for the shares on our consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding increase to treasury stock in shareholders equity 
we paid the tender offer obligation during the quarter ended november   which reduced our available cash 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the sale of services in the normal course of business and proceeds from our revolving line of credit 
our primary uses of liquidity include payments for operating activities  capital expenditures  working capital  and debt repayment 
in connection with the sale of the csbu assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our line of credit agreements with our previous lenders were modified the modified credit agreement 
the modified credit agreement removed one lender from the credit facility  but continued to provide a total of million of borrowing capacity until june   when the borrowing capacity was scheduled to be reduced to million 
in addition  the interest rate on the credit facility increased from libor plus percent to libor plus percent 
during fiscal  we entered into a second modification agreement with the lender on the line of credit facility the second modification agreement 
under the terms of the second modification agreement  our borrowing capacity on the line of credit will be reduced as follows in thousands 
table of contents effective date borrowing capacity june  august  november  in addition  any payments made to us by franklin covey products from the working capital settlement and reimbursable costs associated with the sale transaction note are required to be paid on the line of credit and will reduce the available borrowing capacity by the amount of the payments 
although we impaired the working capital and reimbursable cost note receivable from franklin covey products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our available borrowing capacity on the line of credit was not reduced 
the second modification agreement also increased the effective interest rate from libor plus percent to libor plus percent  effective on the date of the agreement 
the modified credit agreement and second modification agreement expire on march  no change and we may draw on the credit facilities  repay  and draw again  on a revolving basis  up to the maximum loan amount available so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing 
we may use the line of credit facility for general corporate purposes as well as for other transactions  unless prohibited by the terms of the modified credit agreement or second modification agreement 
the working capital line of credit also contains customary representations and guarantees as well as provisions for repayment and liens 
in addition to customary non financial terms and conditions  our line of credit requires us to be in compliance with specified financial covenants  including i a funded debt to earnings ratio  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio  iii a limitation on annual capital expenditures  and iv a defined amount of minimum net worth 
in the event of noncompliance with these financial covenants and other defined events of default  the lenders are entitled to certain remedies  including acceleration of the repayment of amounts outstanding on the line of credit 
the second modification agreement also modified the funded debt to earnings ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio over the quarterly periods ended august and november during the quarter ended august   we believe that we were in compliance with the terms and financial covenants of our credit facility 
at august   we had million outstanding on the line of credit 
based on our forecasts for fiscal  we identified the risk of non compliance with certain of the financial covenants required by our line of credit facility for the quarterly measurement periods ending november  and february  in order to address the risk of non compliance  we obtained a modification to the line of credit agreement the third modification agreement in november the third modification agreement relaxed the funded debt to earnings ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio  and increased the effective interest rate from libor plus percent to libor plus percent 
we believe that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants in future quarterly reporting periods as defined in the third modification agreement 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the past three years in thousands year ended august  total cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended august  
table of contents cash flows from operating activities our cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal the decrease was primarily due to reduced net income for the fiscal year and the sale of the csbu  which had a corresponding decrease in product sales 
our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
cash provided by or used for changes in working capital during fiscal was primarily related to decreased accounts receivable resulting from improved collections of outstanding receivable balances  payments made to reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities from seasonally high balances at each august  and to pay accrued severance costs  and reduced inventory balances resulting from improved forecasting and purchasing processes 
we believe that our continued efforts to optimize working capital balances  combined with existing and planned sales growth programs and cost reduction initiatives  will improve our cash flows from operating activities in future periods 
however  the success of these efforts  and their eventual contribution to our cash flows  is dependent upon numerous factors  many of which are not within our control 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended august  we used million of net cash for investing activities 
our primary uses of cash for investing activities were the purchase of property and equipment  additional spending on curriculum development  and the purchase of coveylink 
our purchases of property and equipment  which totaled million  consisted primarily of computer software  computer hardware  and leasehold improvements 
during fiscal  we spent million for further investment in the development of various programs and curriculum 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired the assets of coveylink  which conducts seminars and provides consulting based upon the book  the speed of trust by stephen mr covey 
net cash used to acquire coveylink  including legal and other professional fees  totaled million 
partially offsetting these uses of cash was the receipt of million from the sale of our canadian office facility 
during fiscal  we expect to spend million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
purchases of property and equipment are expected to consist primarily of new computer software  computer hardware  and in other areas as deemed necessary 
however  actual capital spending is based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during the fiscal year ended august  totaled million  which consisted primarily of the payment of our million tender offer obligation as described above and million of debt principal payments that were partially offset by million of net proceeds from our line of credit facility 
we also received million of net proceeds from the sale of common shares held in treasury to participants in our employee stock purchase plan 
sources of liquidity going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by the sale of goods and services to our clients on the condition that we can continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from our line of credit  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we are currently in negotiations to renew the line of credit to ensure the future availability of liquidity through this facility 
we believe that we will be successful in obtaining a new or extended line of credit from our lender 
additional potential sources of liquidity include factoring receivables  issuance of additional equity  or issuance of debt from public or private sources 
however  no assurance can be provided that we will obtain a new or extended line of credit or obtain additional financing from other sources on terms that would be acceptable to us 
if necessary  we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining a renewal or extension of our line of credit  or additional financing  we believe that cash flows from operations combined with a number of initiatives we would implement in the months preceding the due date will create sufficient liquidity to pay down the required outstanding balance on the line of credit 
these initiatives include deferral of capital purchases for externally developed curriculum and uncommitted capital expenditures  deferral of executive team compensation  deferral of certain related party contractual royalties and earnout payments  substantial reduction of associate salaries  reduction of operating expenses  including non critical travel  and deferral of payments to other vendors in order to generate sufficient cash 

table of contents considering the foregoing  we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of lease payments resulting from the sale of our corporate campus financing obligation  payments to eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing  and distribution services  minimum rent payments for office and warehouse space  the repayment of our line of credit obligation  which matures in fiscal  and short term purchase obligations for inventory items and other products and services used in the ordinary course of business 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total required lease payments on corporate campus minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services minimum operating lease payments line of credit purchase obligations total expected contractual obligation payments our obligation for outsourcing services contains an annual escalation based upon changes in the employment cost index  the impact of which was not estimated in the above table 
we are also contractually allowed to collect amounts from franklin covey products that reduce the amounts shown in the table above 
the operating agreement with franklin covey products provides for reimbursement of a portion of the warehouse leasing costs  the impact of which is not included in the lease obligations in the table above 
our contractual obligations presented above exclude unrecognized tax benefits under fin of million for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment 
for further information regarding the adoption of fin  refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 

table of contents other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic and political conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in leadership  productivity  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
products we sold planners  binders  planner accessories  handheld electronic devices  and other related products that were primarily delivered through our csbu channels prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal we continue to sell these products in certain international locations 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sales transaction in a retail store 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
for transactions that contain more than one element  we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables fasc 
when fair value exists for all contracted elements  the overall contract consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their relative fair values 
revenue for these units is recognized in accordance with our general revenue policies once it has been determined that the delivered items have standalone value to the customer 
if fair value does not exist for all contracted elements  revenue for the delivered items is recognized using the residual method  
table of contents which generally means that revenue recognition is postponed until the point is reached when the delivered items have standalone value and fair value exists for the undelivered items 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue considered for recognition under our general revenue policies is the total contract amount  less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of the undelivered items is based upon the normal pricing practices for our existing training programs  consulting services  and other products  which are generally the prices of the items when sold separately 
our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate our content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell our training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
each licensee is required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of the licensee s sales 
we recognize royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to the company from the licensee 
royalty revenue is reported as a component of training and consulting service sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue is recognized on software sales in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition fasc as amended by sop statement  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products and support to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the majority of our software sales have multiple elements  including a license and post contract customer support pcs 
currently we do not have vsoe for either the license or support elements of our software sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred until the only undelivered element is pcs and the total arrangement fee is recognized over the support period 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation we have a performance based long term incentive plan the ltip that provides for annual grants of share based performance awards to certain managerial personnel and executive management as directed by the compensation committee of the board of directors the compensation committee 
the ltip performance awards cliff vest at the completion of a three year performance period that begins on september in the fiscal year of the grant 
the number of common shares that are finally awarded to ltip participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of specified financial performance objectives during the three year performance period 
due to the variable number of common shares that may be issued under the ltip  we reevaluate our ltip grants on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded based upon actual and estimated financial results of the company compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are made on a cumulative basis at the adjustment date based upon the estimated probable number of common shares to be awarded 
the analysis of our ltip plans contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and judgments about the eventual number of shares that will vest in each ltip grant 
the assumptions and judgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the ltip service periods 
the evaluation of ltip performance awards and the corresponding use of estimated amounts produced additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we recorded cumulative adjustments to the estimated number of common shares to be awarded under the ltip grants as described above 
during the quarter ended november   the compensation committee approved ltip awards for  shares of common stock the target award to be awarded if we achieve the specified financial results of grant  which are primarily based on cumulative operating income growth over the performance period ending august  however  due to ongoing organizational changes following the sale of 
table of contents the csbu  the company s structure evolved to the extent that the fiscal ltip award criteria were no longer consistent with our organization and performance goals and in some cases the approved measurement criteria were no longer measurable 
as a result of these changes  combined with financial performance during the first two quarters of the measurement period  the company determined that no shares would be awarded to participants under the terms of the fiscal ltip award 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized for the fiscal ltip award during fiscal all other ltip awards expired as of august  with no shares vesting to participants under those awards 
we estimate the value of our stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
however  we did not grant any stock options during the fiscal years ended august  or  and we did not have any remaining unrecognized compensation expense attributable to unvested stock options at august  accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write off experience and current economic conditions and we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis 
receivable balances over days past due  which exceed a specified dollar amount  are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the probability for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the collectibility of customer accounts  which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within our control  such as the financial health of each customer 
we regularly review the collectibility assumptions of our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections 
adjustments to the assumptions may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  a percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at august  would increase our reported loss from operations by approximately million 
inventory valuation following the sale of csbu  our inventories are comprised primarily of training materials and training related accessories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are reduced to their fair market value through the use of inventory loss reserves  which are recorded during the normal course of business 
our inventory loss reserve calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding a number of factors  including future inventory demand requirements and pricing strategies 
during the evaluation process we consider historical sales patterns and current sales trends  but these may not be indicative of future inventory losses 
while we have not made material changes to our inventory reserves methodology during the past three years  our inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand and other factors are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses that may have a materially adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations 
for example  a percent increase to our inventory reserves at august  would increase our reported loss from operations by million 

table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life and goodwill balances are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
our goodwill at august  was generated by the acquisition of coveylink during the second quarter of fiscal the covey trade name intangible asset was generated by the merger with the covey leadership center and has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars and international licensee royalties 
if the carrying value of the covey trade name exceeds the fair value of its discounted estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
our impairment evaluation calculations for goodwill and the covey trade name contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  to estimate an appropriate royalty rate  and to select a discount rate that reflects the inherent risk of future cash flows 
our valuation methodology for the covey trade name has remained unchanged during the past three years 
however  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in future periods  significant impairment charges could result that would have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
the valuation methodology is also dependent upon on our share price and corresponding market capitalization  which may differ from estimated royalties used in our annual impairment testing 
based upon the fiscal evaluation of the covey trade name and goodwill  our trade name related revenues  licensee royalties  and overall sales levels would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair them 
however  future declines in our share price may trigger additional impairment testing and may result in impairment charges 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis  which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
our impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  forecast the useful lives of the assets  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
based on these criteria  we have projected positive cash flows over the remaining useful lives of our principal assets  which is years 
although we have not made any material changes to our long lived assets impairment assessment methodology during the past three years  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we regularly evaluate our united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
we account for certain aspects of our income tax provision using the provisions of fin fasc  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon 
table of contents examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon final settlement 
the provisions of fin also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest  and penalties on income taxes  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and require increased disclosure of various income tax items 
taxes and penalties are components of our overall income tax provision 
we record previously unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements when it becomes more likely than not greater than a percent likelihood that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  we consider all available evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence may not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for audits by taxing jurisdictions  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
our unrecognized tax benefits result from uncertain tax positions about which we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations fasc and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements fasc 
these standards aim to improve and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
these statements are effective for our fiscal year beginning september  we do not currently anticipate that these statements will have a material impact upon our financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued eitf  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements fasc 
this consensus amends existing guidance on multiple element revenue arrangements to improve the ability of entities to recognize revenue from the sale of delivered items that are part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
one of the current requirements is that there must be objective and reliable evidence of the standalone selling price of the undelivered items  which must be supported by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe 
this amendment eliminates the requirements that all undelivered elements have vsoe or tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement that is attributable to items that have already been delivered 
the residual method of allocating revenue is thereby eliminated  and entities are required to allocate the arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the consensus is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  and early adoption is permitted 
we have not yet completed a formal analysis of the provisions of eitf regulatory compliance the company is registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on retail sales made through its stores and catalog sales 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations 

table of contents inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
however  future inflation may have an impact on the price of materials used in the production of training products and related accessories  including paper and related raw materials 
we may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain written and oral statements made by the company in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate  or imply future results  performance  or achievements  and may contain words such as believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  or words or phrases of similar meaning

these  and other forward looking statements  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties are disclosed from time to time in reports filed by us with the sec  including reports on forms k  q  and k 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the matters discussed in item a of this report on form k for the fiscal year ended august   entitled risk factors 
in addition  such risks and uncertainties may include unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas unanticipated costs or capital expenditures  difficulties encountered by eds in operating and maintaining our information systems and controls  including without limitation  the systems related to demand and supply planning  inventory control  and order fulfillment  delays or unanticipated outcomes relating to our strategic plans  dependence on existing products or services  the rate and consumer acceptance of new product introductions  competition  the number and nature of customers and their product orders  including changes in the timing or mix of product or training orders  pricing of our products and services and those of competitors  adverse publicity  and other factors which may adversely affect our business 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors may emerge and it is not possible for our management to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any single factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the market price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile 
in addition  the stock markets in general have experienced increased volatility 
factors such as quarter to quarter variations in revenues and earnings or losses and our failure to meet expectations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the price of our common stock can change for reasons unrelated

actual future performance and results will differ and may differ materially from that contained in or suggested by forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in our filings with the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments we are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which includes the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal years ended august    and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expired on a quarterly basis  were recognized in current operations and were used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated statements of operations and had the following net impact on the periods indicated in thousands 
table of contents year ended august  losses on foreign exchange contracts gains on foreign exchange contracts net gain loss on foreign exchange contracts at august   all of our foreign currency forward contracts were settled 
interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily due to our line of credit borrowings 
at august   our debt obligations consisted primarily of a long term lease agreement financing obligation associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters facility and a variable rate line of credit arrangement 
our overall interest rate sensitivity is primarily influenced by amounts borrowed on the line of credit and the prevailing interest rates  which may create additional expense if interest rates increase in future periods 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of percent and the line of credit obligation had a weighted average interest rate of percent at august  at august  borrowing levels  a one percent increase in the interest rate on our variable rate line of credit obligation would increase our interest expense over the next year by approximately million 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
