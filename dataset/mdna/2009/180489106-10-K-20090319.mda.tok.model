overview and outlook we are an advanced oncology diagnostics services company 
our mission is to combine innovative technologies  meaningful test results  and world class expertise to improve the lives of those affected by cancer by bringing clarity to a complex disease 
our vision is to be the leader in cancer diagnostics by dedicating ourselves to collaborative relationships with the health care community as we translate cancer discovery and information into better patient care 
we were founded and organized in and are headquartered in aliso viejo  california 
our focus is on identifying high quality opportunities to increase our profitability and differentiate our service offerings in this highly competitive market 
an important aspect of our strategy is to develop high value  revenue generating opportunities by connecting our medical expertise and our intellectual property with our strong commercial team to commercialize novel diagnostic tests also referred to as novel markers or biomarkers 
novel diagnostic tests detect characteristics of an individual s tumor or disease that  once identified and qualified  allow for more accurate prognosis  diagnosis and treatment 
in addition  we are working to identify specific partners and technologies where we can assist in the commercialization of third party novel diagnostic tests 
we believe that broader discovery and use of novel diagnostic tests will clarify and simplify decisions for healthcare providers and the biopharmaceutical industry 
the growing demand for personalized medicine has generated a need for these novel diagnostic tests  creating a new market for such novel diagnostic tests  widely expected to reach billion by  based upon industry analyst data and management s internal estimates 
in  we will continue to focus on four primary areas maintain financial discipline as we move closer towards profitability  leverage our commercial channel to launch new tests and maintain our revenue growth trajectory  expand our commercial efforts to reach new customers while increasing the breadth and depth of services we provide to our existing customers  and invest in high value expansion opportunities that increase shareholder value 
characteristics of our revenue and expenses revenue 
revenue is derived from billing governmental and private health insurers  clients  and patients for the oncology diagnostic services that we provide 
our billing to such payors is discussed in item  billing

cost of services 
cost of services includes compensation including stock based compensation and benefits of laboratory personnel  laboratory support personnel  and pathology personnel 
it also includes depreciation of laboratory equipment  costs of laboratory supplies  allocated facilities related expenses  and certain direct costs such as shipping 
see note to the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements for a discussion of certain current and prior year adjustments of expense classifications between cost of services and operating expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of the compensation and benefits of our sales force

it also includes allocated facilities related expenses  insurance  recruiting  legal  auditing  and other professional services 
bad debt 
bad debt consists of estimated uncollectible accounts  or portions thereof  recorded during the period

the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically  based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of compensation and benefits for research and development personnel  laboratory supplies  certain information technology personnel  consultants  and allocated facility related costs 
our research and development activities primarily relate to the development and validation of diagnostic tests in connection with our specialized oncology diagnostic services  as well as the development of technology to electronically deliver such services to our clients 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
management believes that the following estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue for our diagnostic testing and interpretive services is recognized at the time of completion of such services 
our services are billed to various payors  including medicare  health insurance companies  and other directly billed healthcare institutions  and patients 
we report revenue from contracted payors  including certain health insurance companies and healthcare institutions  based on the contracted rate or in certain instances  our estimate of such rate 
for billing to medicare  we utilize the published fee schedules  net of standard discounts commonly referred to as contractual allowances 
we report revenue from non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and patients  based on the amount expected to be collected for services provided 
adjustments resulting from actual collections compared to our aforementioned estimates are recognized in the period realized 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for estimated uncollectible amounts due from various payor groups such as medicare and private health insurance companies 
the process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with our diagnostic services involves significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically  and is principally based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience 
we also review the age of receivables by payor class to assess our allowance at each period end 
the payment realization cycle for certain governmental and managed care payors can be lengthy  involving denial  appeal and adjudication processes  and is subject to periodic adjustments that may be significant 
accounts receivable are periodically written off when identified as uncollectible and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to bad debt expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s gross accounts receivable by payor class as a percentage of total gross accounts receivable at december  and is as follows governmental private health insurers clients pathologists  hospitals  clinics patients collection of governmental  private health insurer  and client receivables are generally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the insurers and clients within the various filing deadlines 
collection of receivables due from patients and clients is generally subject to increased credit risk due to credit worthiness or inability to pay 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense related to stock based awards  including stock options and restricted stock  based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option pricing model 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the stock based awards that are ultimately expected to vest and thus the gross expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method for employees and ratably for non employees 
we classify compensation expense related to these awards in the consolidated statements of operations based on the department to which the recipient reports 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents our results of continuing operations and the percentage of the years revenue in thousands revenue cost of services gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative bad debt research and development total operating expenses loss from operations other expense  net income tax expense loss from continuing operations see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain current and prior year adjustment of expense classifications between cost of services and operating expenses 
year ended december  versus december  revenue revenue of million for the year ended december  increased or million from million in the prior year 
our increased revenue resulted from increased volume and a favorable mix of oncology diagnostic services provided to our existing clients  as well as our additions of new clients 
our client base increased to approximately active clients at december  from approximately active clients at december  during the first quarter of  we expanded the breadth of our diagnostic services to include cancer markers for tumors of the colon  prostate  and lung 
we expect to steadily increase our menu of oncology diagnostic services to include markers for additional tumor types and to deepen our market penetration for the diagnostic services that we currently provide 
a number of recently published clinical findings have promoted the use of certain biomarkers to predict patient response to a class of colorectal cancer drugs that are focused on blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr signaling pathway 
our tests such as k ras a newly emerging biomarker to outline alterations in the egfr pathway are therefore becoming a more recognized tool in the medical community for predicting an individual s response to drug therapies for colorectal cancers 
we have also steadily increased the depth of our diagnostic services for certain cancer types that we have previously provided  including lymphoma leukemia 
our expanding capabilities in ihc  flow cytometry  fish  and molecular pcr  and our marketing of such capabilities  have enabled our revenue growth in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to increase as we further execute our operational strategy of expanding the breadth and depth of our cancer diagnostic services  and the means by which our services are marketed and delivered to our customers 

table of contents another contributor to our revenue growth has been an overall increase in medicare reimbursement rates which include cancer diagnostic services  effective january  in addition  many of our third party contract rates are based upon medicare rates  which consequently  also increased 
in july  the medicare rate increase for technical cpt codes under the physician fee schedule that retroactively took effect as of january  was extended eighteen months through december  see billing section above for a summarized chart of medicare reimbursement rates under the physician fee schedule for the most common cpt codes used in our laboratory services in and effective january   numerous other cpt codes under the physician fee schedule and clinical fee schedule for services we perform generally increased through december  cost of services and gross margin cost of services for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
the million increase was driven by an overall increase in revenue  and was primarily related to additional laboratory personnel costs of million  increased laboratory reagents and other supplies expense of million  increased allocated facilities expense of million  increased cost of tests performed on our behalf by other laboratories of million  and an increase in shipping expense of million 
gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an overall increase in revenue including higher value oncology diagnostic services 
in addition  employee productivity continues to improve based on metrics of specimens prepared and tested by month per full time equivalent fte employee 
we have also realized greater economies of scale in operations through our business growth as compared to the prior year 
gross margin  however  does not include the bad debt expense that impacts our overall results 
see discussion below 
we anticipate that gross margins will improve as our testing volume increases  we more effectively utilize our operating capacity  and we more efficiently manage our operations 
if the adjusted medicare reimbursement rates effective january  are decreased after december   gross margins could be adversely affected 
operating and other expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses of million for the year ended december  increased  or million  from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily related to additional sales and marketing personnel costs of million which included increased sales commission expense of million  a million increase in travel related expenses  and increased tradeshow  advertising  and consulting fees of million 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  represents a million or increase over the prior year of million 
as a percent of revenue  however  general and administrative expenses declined from of revenue in to of revenue in the million increase is primarily related to additional personnel costs of million to support our business growth and to establish an in house billing and collection department  plus severance expenses of approximately million  partially offset by a million decrease in third party billing and collection fees 
as compared to the prior year  accounting and legal fees increased by million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounting fees was primarily associated with the testing of internal controls over financial reporting 
the increase in legal fees was primarily associated with sec compliance  corporate governance  financing arrangements  and executive compensation 

table of contents bad debt 
bad debt expense of million for the year ended december  increased or million from million for the prior year 
we recorded bad debt expense at a rate of approximately and of revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in bad debt expense is primarily related to our increase in revenue as compared to the prior year and the impact on cash collections due to delays in our internal billing and collection efforts 
bad debt expense was also impacted by higher loss experience  including significant uncollectible accounts identified during the second half of which were previously serviced by our former third party billing and collection service provider 
we expect that bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue in will be less as compared to as we further staff our in house billing and collection department  more effectively manage our billing and collection function  and improve the overall quality of our billing and collection processes 
research and development 
research and development expense of million for the year ended december  decreased or million from million for the prior year 
research and development expenses include compensation and benefits for research and development personnel  laboratory supplies  certain information technology personnel  consultants  and allocated facility related costs 
our research and development activities primarily relate to the development and validation of diagnostic tests in connection with our specialized oncology diagnostic services  as well as the development of technology to electronically deliver such services to our clients 
loss from operations

the million decrease in loss from operations was principally due to our revenue increase  partially offset by the various items which served to increase cost of services by million and operating expenses by million 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense primarily consists of interest expense  including the amortization of the fair value of issued common stock warrants in connection with borrowings under our credit facility with safeguard see note to the consolidated financial statements and certain other lenders 
the increase in interest expense is primarily related to higher average outstanding short term borrowings in the current year to support our growing operations and the recognition  through interest expense  of the fair value of common stock warrants issued to safeguard in march through november in connection with the new mezzanine facility  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognized million and million of interest expense related to the value of such common stock warrants in the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  versus december  revenue revenue increased or million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from the execution of our marketing and sales strategy which resulted in increased sales to new and existing customers 
cost of services and gross margin cost of services for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  driven by a increase in revenue 
gross margin was in compared to in the increase in gross margin in was attributable to the significant increase in revenue and a shift to more profitable types of diagnostic services

bad debt expense of million for the year ended december  increased or million from million in the prior year 
we recorded bad debt expense at a rate of approximately and of revenue for and  respectively

research and development expenses primarily represent the personnel costs  material costs  consulting costs  and allocated overhead in our efforts to develop and validate assays for the purpose of expanding our specialized oncology diagnostic services and the development of technology to electronically deliver such services to our clients 
loss from operations

the million decrease in loss from operations was principally due to our revenue increase  partially offset by the various items which served to increase cost of services by million and operating expenses by million 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense primarily consists of interest expense in connection with borrowings under our credit facility with safeguard and certain other lenders

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
working capital deficiency at december  we had a working capital deficiency total current assets minus total current liabilities of million 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   which was an improvement of million as compared to the prior year 
our net loss of million was the primary factor in our cash used from operating activities 
our revenue increased as compared to 
table of contents the prior year  though as further discussed below  our cash collections have not kept pace with our significant revenue growth 
our net accounts receivable at december  increased million  or from december  we continue to expand our oncology diagnostic services volume and we have incurred additional personnel  administrative  and overhead costs in as compared to the prior year 
we also established an in house billing and collection department which began operations on june  as our revenue increases  and as we improve the effectiveness of our in house billing and collection department  which we believe will allow us to more effectively manage our billing and collection function  and improve the overall quality of our billing and collection processes  we expect that our days sales outstanding will decrease  resulting in an improvement in cash flows from operating activities in as compared to investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  of million consisted of capital expenditures related primarily to purchases of new laboratory equipment and information technology system enhancements 
the million decrease in cash provided by investing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the million in proceeds from the sale of our former technology business  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million which was utilized to support our working capital needs 
the million increase in cash provided by financing activities between the years ended december  and was primarily attributable to a net increase in borrowings of million under our new mezzanine facility  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by a net reduction of million in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
lease arrangements aliso viejo facility in july  we signed a ten year lease for our facility in aliso viejo  california  which began on december  the lease provides us with two five year renewal options 
during the first quarter of  we entered into sublease agreements with two tenants 
in the second quarter of  one of our sublease tenants filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and defaulted on its lease with us 
we do not believe that the loss of the total undiscounted payments due to us of approximately million will significantly impact our liquidity position 
we do not plan on securing a new sublease tenant and we are in the process of augmenting the additional space to expand laboratory capacity and administrative offices  including offices for our new in house billing and collection department 

table of contents credit arrangements the following table summarizes outstanding balances under our credit arrangements excluding capital lease obligations and unamortized discount on the new mezzanine facility and our remaining credit availability under such arrangements as of december  in thousands outstanding december  credit availability december  earliest stated maturity date  as amended in february note to the consolidated financial statements comerica facility  march  new mezzanine facility   april  gemino facility  january  excludes million standby letter of credit issued to the landlord of our aliso viejo  california headquarters and laboratory 
in february  we amended our comerica facility  gemino facility  and new mezzanine facility  resulting in an extension of the maturity dates for each 
our maximum availability increased from million to million under the restated new mezzanine facility 
our maximum availability increased from million to million under the comerica facility  as amended 
our financial covenants under the amended comerica facility and amended gemino facility were modified 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in house billing and collection on june  our billing and collection department began operations  utilizing licensed billing and collection software 
during the fourth quarter of we ceased utilizing the services of our former billing and collection service provider 
the level of cash collections in by our billing and collection department have not increased at the same rate as our revenue has increased 
we did not have adequate internal resources to address the unanticipated issues that arose in the implementation of our internal billing and collection department 
consequently  our collection efforts under our new in house billing system were negatively impacted 
in addition  the change in our medicare administrative contractor during the fourth quarter of delayed the timing of our cash collections 
due to the aforementioned  our cash flow from operating activities in was adversely affected 
in  we plan to make attempts to improve the overall quality of our billing and collection processes and more effectively manage our billing and collection function 
if our expectations are not realized  we could fail to meet the financial covenants contained in our credit facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements and be in default of such facilities 
in addition  we rely on cash collections to support our general working capital needs 
it is therefore critical that we are able to improve the effectiveness of our billing and collection department in going concern our credit facilities with gemino  comerica  and safeguard  contain certain covenants which require our compliance 
in order for us to comply with the financial covenants contained within our credit facilities with gemino and comerica  as amended in january and february see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  our results of operations and level of cash collections in and beyond must exceed our results  and such outcome is uncertain 
failure to maintain compliance with the financial and or certain other covenants contained within our credit facilities would constitute an event of default under the respective credit facility and by 
table of contents agreement  would result in a cross default under the other credit facilities 
if we were not able to obtain a waiver of default from our lenders  our borrowings under the respective credit facilities would immediately become due and payable  and we would not have the ability to repay borrowings under our credit facilities at such time 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain waivers from our existing lenders or fully access our existing financing sources in the event of default 
in addition  our credit facilities  as amended in february see note to the consolidated financial statements  with comerica  safeguard  and gemino contain material adverse change mac clauses 
if we encountered difficulties that would qualify as a mac in our i operations  ii condition financial or otherwise  or iii ability to repay amounts outstanding under our facilities  our credit agreements could be cancelled 
gemino  comerica  and safeguard could then elect to declare the indebtedness under the applicable facility  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness 
at december   we had a working capital deficiency of million and did not have sufficient cash availability to repay our credit facilities coming due in the first quarter of  or amounts that would be due earlier than maturity if we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants contained within our credit facilities see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
we are therefore currently in the process of evaluating certain financing alternatives for our current credit arrangements 
due to our financial condition and the ongoing turmoil in the financial and credit markets  our ability to obtain extensions to our existing credit facilities  or to obtain new credit facilities  may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable to us and our stockholders  or obtain additional and or extended financing at all 
if we were not able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all  we would curtail expenses  halt capital expenditures  and consider staff furloughs 
for the reasons above  there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes that we will have sufficient resources to pay our obligations as they become due during the next twelve months and do not reflect adjustments that might result if we were not to continue as a going concern 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   including our facility lease and borrowings on equipment subject to capital leases 
our credit facilities with gemino  comerica  and safeguard were amended in january and february see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  which resulted in an extended maturity date for each credit facility 
the below table excludes scheduled sublease receipts  any remaining amounts necessary to complete our leasehold improvements  and also excludes a million standby letter of credit provided to the landlord under the lease agreement  expiring december  for our facility in aliso viejo  california 
payment due by period at december  total less than year years years after years in thousands comerica facility new mezzanine facility gemino facility capital lease obligations operating leases total 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or involve leasing  hedging or research and development services for our business or other similar arrangements that may expose us to liability that is not expressly reflected in the consolidated financial statements  except for operating leases 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  except our relationship with cps  described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as such  we are not subject to any material financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements several new accounting standards have been issued and adopted recently 
none of these standards had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short term maturities of these investments 
as of december  the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
we had million of variable interest rate debt outstanding at december  the variable interest rates we pay on this debt may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
the comerica facility bore interest at either the comerica prime rate minus  or the day london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the gemino facility bore interest at the day libor plus 
the new mezzanine facility bore interest at a fixed annual rate of through june  and bore interest at a fixed annual rate of from july  through december  the interest rate on the new mezzanine facility is fixed and is therefore not impacted by changes in interest rates 
a increase in the applicable interest rate on our variable interest rate credit facilities would have negatively impacted our pre tax results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  by approximately million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of changes in our credit facilities in  including interest rate adjustments  as a result of credit facility amendments consummated in february
