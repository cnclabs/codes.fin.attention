item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors beginning on page of this report 
overview we operate distinctive and large  multi use sports and athletic  professional fitness  family recreation and spa centers in a resort like environment 
as of february   we operated centers primarily in residential locations across states under the life time fitness brand 
we compare the results of our centers based on how long the centers have been open at the most recent measurement period 
we include a center for comparable center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month of the center s operation  prior to which time we refer to the center as a new center 
we include an acquired center for comparable center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month after we assumed the center s operations 
as we grow our presence in existing markets by opening new centers  we expect to attract some memberships away from our other existing centers already in those markets  reducing revenue and initially lowering the memberships of those existing centers 
in addition  as a result of new center openings in existing markets  and because older centers will represent an increasing proportion of our center base over time  our comparable center revenue may be lower in future periods than in the past 
of the up to six new centers we have opened or plan to open in  three will be in existing markets 
we do not expect that operating costs of our planned new centers will be significantly higher than centers opened in the past  and we also do not expect that the planned increase in the number of centers will have a material adverse effect on the overall 
table of contents financial condition or results of operations of existing centers 
another result of opening new centers  as well as the assumption of operations of seven leased facilities in  the assumption of operations of one leased facility in and the six facilities we entered into sale leaseback transactions for in  is that our center operating margins may be lower than they have been historically  particularly as newly opened centers build membership 
we expect both the addition of pre opening expenses and the lower revenue volumes characteristic of newly opened centers  as well as the occupancy costs for the eight leased centers and the lease costs for facilities which we financed through sale leaseback transactions  to affect our center operating margins at these centers and on a consolidated basis 
as the economy continues to slow  we also expect increased member attrition  lower average dues  lower in center revenue per membership as well as higher membership acquisition costs which may result in lower total revenue and operating profit in affected centers 
our categories of new centers and existing centers do not include the center owned by bloomingdale  llc because it is accounted for as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and is not consolidated in our financial statements 
we measure performance using such key operating statistics as member satisfaction ratings  return on investment  average revenue per membership  including membership dues and enrollment fees  average in center revenue per membership and center operating expenses  with an emphasis on payroll and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales and comparable center revenue growth 
we use center revenue and ebitda margins to evaluate overall performance and profitability on an individual center basis 
in addition  we focus on several membership statistics on a center level and system wide basis 
these metrics include change in center membership levels and growth of system wide memberships  percentage center membership to target capacity  center membership usage  center membership mix among individual  couple and family memberships and center attrition rates 
during  our attrition rate increased  driven primarily by inactive members leaving earlier than in the past 
we have three primary sources of revenue 
first  our largest source of revenue is membership dues of total revenue for the year ended december  and enrollment fees of total revenue for the year ended december  paid by our members 
we recognize revenue from monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
we recognize revenue from enrollment fees over the expected average life of the membership  which we estimate to be months for the fourth quarter of  months for the second and third quarters of and months for the first quarter of and prior periods 
second  we generate revenue within a center  which we refer to as in center revenue  or in center businesses of total revenue for the year ended december   including fees for personal training  registered dieticians  group fitness training and other member activities  sales of products at our lifecafe  sales of products and services offered at our lifespa  tennis programs and renting space in certain of our centers 
third  we have expanded the life time fitness brand into other wellness related offerings that generate revenue  which we refer to as other revenue  or corporate businesses of total revenue for the year ended december   including our media  wellness and athletic events businesses 
our primary media offering is our magazine  experience life 
other revenue also includes two restaurants in the minneapolis market and rental income from our highland park  minnesota office building 
center operations expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  payroll taxes  benefits  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs  utilities  repairs and maintenance  supplies  administrative support and communications to operate our centers 
advertising and marketing expenses consist of our marketing department costs and media and advertising costs to support center membership levels  in center businesses and our corporate businesses 
general and administrative expenses include costs relating to our centralized support functions  such as accounting  information systems  procurement  real estate and development and member relations 
our other operating expenses include the costs associated with our media  athletic events and nutritional product businesses  two restaurants and other corporate expenses  as well as gains or losses on our dispositions of assets 
our total operating expenses may vary from period to period depending on the number of new centers opened during that period  the number of centers engaged in presale activities and the performance of our in center businesses 
our primary capital expenditures relate to the construction of new centers and updating and maintaining our existing centers 
the land acquisition  construction and equipment costs for a current model center can vary considerably based on variability in land cost and the cost of construction labor  as well as whether or not a tennis area is included or whether or not we expand the gymnasium or add other facilities 
we perform maintenance and make improvements on our centers and equipment throughout each year 
we conduct a more thorough remodeling project at each center approximately every four to six years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
ultimate results could differ from those estimates 
in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations  we use estimates based on the best information available 
we use estimates for such items as depreciable lives  volatility factors  expected lives and rate of return in determining fair value of option grants  tax provisions and provisions for uncollectible receivables 
we also use estimates for calculating the amortization period for deferred enrollment fee revenue and associated direct costs  which are based on the historical average expected life of center memberships 
we revise the recorded estimates when better information is available  facts change or we can determine actual amounts 
these revisions can affect operating results 
we have identified below the following accounting policies that we consider to be critical 
revenue recognition 
we receive a one time enrollment fee at the time a member joins and monthly membership dues for usage from our members 
the enrollment fees are non refundable after days 
enrollment fees and related direct expenses  primarily sales commissions  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over an estimated membership period of months  which is based on historical membership experience 
we review the estimated membership period on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances change 
changes in member behavior  competition  economic conditions and our performance may cause attrition levels to change  which could impact the average estimated membership period 
during  there was a substantial shift in our attrition activity  primarily as a result of macroeconomic pressures and a challenging consumer environment 
during the second quarter of  we changed our average membership life from months to months 
the pressure continued throughout the second half of  therefore  we reduced the average membership life to months at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
if the estimated membership period had been months for the entire year ended december   the impact would have been an increase in net income of less than million 
if the direct expenses related to the enrollment fees exceed the enrollment fees for any center  the amount of direct expenses in excess of the enrollment fees are expensed in the current period instead of deferred over the average membership life 
the amount of direct expenses in excess of enrollment fees totaled million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
monthly membership dues paid in advance of a center opening are deferred until the center opens 
we only offer members month to month memberships and recognize as revenue the monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
we provide services at each of our centers  including personal training  lifespa  lifecafe and other member services 
the revenue associated with these services is recognized at the time the service is performed 
personal training revenue received in advance of training sessions and the related commissions are deferred and recognized when services are performed 
other revenue  which includes revenue generated primarily from our media  athletic events and restaurant  is recognized when realized and earned 
media advertising revenue is recognized over the duration of the advertising placement 
for athletic events  revenue is generated primarily through sponsorship sales and registration fees 
athletic event revenue is recognized upon the completion of the event 
in limited instances in our media and athletic events businesses  we recognize revenue on barter transactions 
we recognize barter revenue equal to the lesser of the value of the advertising or promotion given up or the value of the asset received 
restaurant revenue is recognized at the point of sale to the customer 
pre opening operations 
we generally operate a preview center up to nine months prior to the planned opening of a center during which time memberships are sold as construction of the center is completed 
the revenue and direct membership acquisition costs  primarily sales commissions  incurred during the period prior to a center opening are deferred until the center opens and are then recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated membership period  beginning when the center opens  however  all other costs  including advertising  office and rent expenses incurred during this period  are expensed as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets 
the carrying value of our long lived assets is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
we consider a history of consistent and significant operating losses to be our primary indicator of potential impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at an individual center or corporate business level 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to that center or corporate business  compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value

in december  bloomingdale llc entered into a management agreement with us  pursuant to which we agreed to manage the day to day operations of the center  subject to the overall supervision by the management committee of bloomingdale llc  which is comprised of six members  two from each of the three members of the joint venture 
we have no unilateral control of the center  as all decisions essential to the accomplishments of the purpose of the joint venture require the approval of a majority of the members 
bloomingdale llc is accounted for as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and is not consolidated in our financial statements 
additional details related to our interest in bloomingdale llc are provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures we use ebitda and ebitda margin as measures of operating performance 
ebitda should not be considered as a substitute for net income  cash flows provided by operating activities  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap 
the funds depicted by ebitda are not necessarily available for discretionary use if they are reserved for particular capital purposes  to maintain compliance with debt covenants  to service debt or to pay taxes 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to service its debt and we are required to comply with certain covenants and borrowing limitations that are based on variations of ebitda in certain of our financing documents  and it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same consistent measurement basis of operating performance used by management  and as the basis for incentive bonuses paid to selected members of senior and center level management 
we have provided reconciliations of ebitda to net income in the section quarterly results unaudited  located immediately following the report of independent registered public accounting firm 

table of contents seasonality of business seasonal trends have a limited effect on our overall business 
generally  we have experienced greater membership growth at the beginning of the year and we have not experienced an increased rate of membership attrition during any particular season of the year 
during the summer months  we have experienced a slight increase in operating expenses due to our outdoor aquatics operations 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity historically  we have satisfied our liquidity needs through various debt arrangements  sales of equity and cash flow provided by operations 
principal liquidity needs have included the development of new centers  debt service requirements and expenditures necessary to maintain and update our existing centers and associated fitness equipment 
we believe that we can satisfy our current and longer term debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements with cash flow from operations  by the extension of the terms of or refinancing our existing debt facilities  through sale leaseback transactions and by continuing to raise long term debt or equity capital  although there can be no assurance that such actions can or will be completed 
our business model operates with negative working capital because we carry minimal accounts receivable due to our ability to have monthly membership dues paid by electronic draft  we defer enrollment fee revenue and we fund the construction of our new centers under standard arrangements with our vendors that are paid with proceeds from long term debt 
credit rating 
we have never had public debt 
accordingly  we do not have  nor have we had  a credit rating as stated through standard and poor s rating services or moody s investor service
