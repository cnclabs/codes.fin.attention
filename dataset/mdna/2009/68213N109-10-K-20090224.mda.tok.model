item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise stated  references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal year and the associated quarters of those fiscal years 
overview we were incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc our healthcare automation solutions are designed to enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical surgical supplies  and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
when used in combination  our products and services provide healthcare facilities with a comprehensive solution designed to enhance patient safety and improve operational efficiency 
we sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems primarily in the united states 
substantially all of our revenue is generated in the united states 
our sales force is organized by geographic region in the united states and canada 
we also sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe and south america 
we have not sold and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the us department of state  or those subject to economic sanctions and export controls 
in  we manufactured the majority of our systems in our california facility and refurbishment and spare parts activities were conducted in our illinois facility 
we continued manufacturing sub assemblies at a few single source off shore manufacturing suppliers to provide increased manufacturing capacity 
in  we established a subsidiary in india  omnicell corporation india private limited 
this subsidiary is focused on software product development and customer support 
a substantial number of our u 
s employees involved in sales  customer support and installation work remotely 
in general  we recognize revenue when our systems are installed 
installation generally takes place two weeks to nine months after our systems are ordered for all of our products except mobile carts 
installation of mobile carts takes place one to three months after the order is received 
the installation process at our customers sites includes internal procedures associated with large capital expenditures and time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time necessary for our customers to plan for and complete the installation of our systems  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and working at the customer s pace 
the amount of revenue recognized in future periods may depend on  among other things  the terms and timing of lease contract renewals  additional product sales and the size of such transactions 
we believe that future revenue will be affected by the competitiveness of our products and services 
our business grew from million of revenue in to million of revenue in we believe that three factors were primarily responsible for this growth we have continued to differentiate ourselves through a strategy intended to create the best customer experience in healthcare  we have delivered industry leading products with differentiated product features that are designed to appeal to nurses and pharmacists  and 
table of contents the market environment of increased patient safety awareness and increased regulatory control has driven our solutions to be a high priority in the capital budgets of healthcare facilities 
our product backlog consisting of orders accepted but not yet installed  decreased from million at december  to million at december   because our customers experienced a more challenging financial environment caused by general macroeconomic conditions  which have contributed to decreasing investment returns  decreasing charitable donations and increasing costs of financing 
we believe the macroeconomic environment that caused our customers to postpone their acquisition decisions will continue well into and we are likely to continue to experience delays in closing contracts 
while we do not see our competitive position changing  we do not see fewer non automated hospitals  or competitive swap out opportunities in our pipeline of potential orders to due to the slow down in bookings  we expect revenue to decrease for we expect to operate through with backlog within our objective of to months of revenue 
we believe that our key business strategies are a significant component to our success in achieving market acceptance of our products and services 
these key strategies include delivering solutions that are designed to provide our customers with the best experience in the healthcare industry by proactively anticipating and meeting customer needs  listening carefully to our customers prospective issues  and meeting and exceeding our customers installation and support needs 
sustaining technological leadership in the development of our products by consistently innovating in our product and service offerings  and maintaining our flexibility in customer product design and in the installation process 
in order to implement these strategies during  we increased our field support to foster better customer service  continued to announce new product offerings such as the latest version of our software which provides significant enhancements to our operating room system for anesthesiologists  continued our strategy to manufacture sub assemblies at manufacturing supplier locations  providing us the potential for increased manufacturing capacity  increased flexibility and reduced demands on working capital  and maintained the staffing at our subsidiary in india to take advantage of the large local talent pool  to improve our cost structure and to provide more resources to our customers 
in  we generated negative overall cash flow of million  mainly due to million in stock repurchases 
however  net cash provided by operations continued to be positive for the third consecutive year at million for the year ended december  and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  was million 
we expect cash provided by operations to remain positive in in  net cash provided by operations was million and we had cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  of million 
during  we grew our headcount to keep pace with increased sales and installations and related operational demands which was offset by a reduction of headcount by closing our elgin  south carolina facility in an effort to consolidate our mobile cart manufacturing in california 
our full time employee headcount grew to at december  from at december  
table of contents however  we subsequently reduced our full time employee headcount to as announced on january  and do not anticipate headcount growth during in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r revised share based payment or sfas no 
r  to record compensation costs of share based awards 
total share based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million 
the impact on net income per share for the year ended december  was per share basic and per share diluted 
we anticipate that the growth rate of our cost of product revenue and expenses from share based compensation  may  at times  exceed the future growth rate of our revenues 
our gross profit improved for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to higher revenue during however  gross margin decreased by percentage points to for  primarily due to product mix changes 
we believe that our gross margins could decline further in as a result of market price reductions  additional costs to expand our business and expenses from share based compensation expenses 
this decrease could be offset by improved efficiency in our field operations and lowered component and subassembly costs from ongoing supplier management programs 
profitability of our business declined during higher gross profit from increased sales was more than offset by increased investments in the customer facing portions of our business  in research and development and in infrastructure and from a reduction in interest income from cash balances 
most significantly  our results in benefited from a reduction in our tax valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  while in  we no longer had the benefit of net operating loss carry forwards realized in prior years 
we operate in one business segment  the design  manufacturing  selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems 
our management team evaluates our profit performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 

table of contents post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided by us under separate support services terms 
we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  based upon our evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we use signed customer contracts and signed customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement for leases and sales 
for service engagements  we use a signed services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
product delivery 
software and hardware delivery is deemed to occur upon successful installation and receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation of installation letter providing evidence that we have delivered what the customer ordered 
product delivery is deemed to have occurred upon receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation letter in instances of a customer self installed installation 
fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
collection is probable 
we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment 
our historical experience has been that collection from our customers is generally probable 
in general  for sales not requiring our installation or modification  we recognize sales on delivery of products to our customers 
we recognize sales on shipment to distributors since we do not allow for rights of return 
we separately sell training and professional services which are not part of multiple element arrangements and not integral to the performance of our systems 
we recognize revenue on training and professional services as they are performed 
vsoe of training and of professional services is based on the price paid when sold separately 
a portion of our sales is made through multi year lease agreements 
we generally sell our non us government leases to third party leasing finance companies on a non recourse basis and recognize revenue on these leases at the net present value of the lease payment stream 
we exclude from revenue amounts paid to us for a new sale that relates to the termination of an existing lease 
generally  we have no obligation to the leasing company once the lease is sold 
some of our lease sales  mostly those relating to us government hospitals  are retained in house as sales type leases which we account for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we recognize revenue on sales type leases at completion of our installation obligation  if any  and at the beginning of the non cancelable payment terms 
the revenue recognized is calculated at the net present value of the future payment stream 
interest income in sales type leases is recognized in product revenue using the interest method 
provision for reserves 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables and our net investment in sales type leases based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 

table of contents valuation and impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we perform our goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets and certain purchased intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long lived or intangible assets 
in future periods  material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost utilizing standard costs  which approximate the first in  first out method or market 
we routinely assess our on hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete  slow moving or otherwise impaired inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of share based awards 
in  we adopted sfas no 
r  and selected a modified prospective transition method using the black scholes merton option price method for determining and for recording the fair value of share based awards compensation costs 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards  which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
the valuation assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of employee share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over the vesting period or the requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions sfas no 
r 
accounting for taxes on income 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against net deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management performs assessments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
these assessments require that 
table of contents management make significant judgments and evaluations of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
we also recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority according to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
fair value measurements  or sfas no  which the fasb issued in september sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
in february  fasb issued fsp   application of fasb statement no

and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement and fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp amends sfas no 
to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until fiscal years beginning after november  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis 
the adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value  as follows level inputs  which include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs  which include observable inputs other than level inputs  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  and level inputs  which include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques  as well as significant management judgment or estimation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
 
table of contents which the fasb issued in february sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards  which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas no 
 an entity may elect to use fair value to measure certain eligible items 
the fair value option may be elected generally on an instrument by instrument basis as long as it is applied to the instrument in its entirety  even if an entity has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
upon adoption  we did not elect to adopt the fair value option on any of our eligible items under sfas no

however  we may be required or choose to raise additional capital through the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements or debt 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution and such securities may have rights

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we invest our cash in cash investments with original or remaining maturities of three months or less and whose principal is not subject to market rate fluctuations 
accordingly  interest rate declines would adversely affect our interest income but would not affect the carrying value of our cash investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents as of december   a hypothetical or basis points decrease in interest rates would reduce our quarterly interest income by approximately million
