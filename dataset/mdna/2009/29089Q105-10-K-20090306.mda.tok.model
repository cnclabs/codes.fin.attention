item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview product portfolio we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development  manufacture and commercialization of vaccine and immune related therapeutic that assist the body s immune system to prevent or treat disease 
for financial reporting purposes  we operate in two business segments  biodefense and commercial 
our biodefense segment focuses on vaccines and therapeutics for use against biological agents that are potential weapons of bioterrorism or biowarfare 
our product candidates in this segment are focused on two specific biological agents anthrax and botulinum 
within our anthrax product portfolio  we manufacture and market biothrax anthrax vaccine adsorbed  the only vaccine licensed by the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the prevention of anthrax infection 
in addition to biothrax  we are developing a recombinant protective antigen anthrax  or rpa  vaccine an advanced biothrax vaccine  an anthrax immune globulin therapeutic and a recombinant anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic 
within our botulinum product portfolio  we are developing a recombinant botulinum vaccine 
our commercial segment focuses on vaccines and therapeutics for use against infectious diseases and other medical conditions that have resulted in significant unmet or underserved public health needs 
our product candidates in this segment include a typhoid vaccine  a tuberculosis vaccine  a hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine and a chlamydia vaccine 
our biodefense segment has generated net income for each of the last five fiscal years 
our commercial segment has generated revenue through development contracts and grant funding 
none of our commercial product candidates has received marketing approval and  therefore  our commercial segment has not generated any product sales revenues 
as a result  our commercial segment has incurred a net loss for each of the last five fiscal years 
product sales we have derived substantially all of our product sales revenues from biothrax sales to the us department of health and human services  or hhs  and us department of defense  or dod  and expect for the foreseeable future to continue to derive substantially all of our product sales revenues from the sales of biothrax to the us government 
our total revenues from biothrax sales were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are focused on increasing sales of biothrax to us government customers  expanding the market for biothrax to other customers domestically and internationally and pursuing label expansions and improvements for biothrax 
contracts and grants we seek to advance development of our product candidates through external funding arrangements 
we may slow down development programs or place them on hold during periods that are not covered by external funding 
we have received external funding awards for the following development programs product or product candidate funding source biothrax post exposure prophylaxis hhs advanced biothrax vaccine biomedical advanced research and development authority and national institute of allergy and infectious disease anthrax immune globulin therapeutic national institute of allergy and infectious diseases anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic biomedical advanced research and development authority and national institute of allergy and infectious disease typhella vaccine the wellcome trust recombinant botulinum vaccine national institute of allergy and infectious diseases additionally  our tuberculosis vaccine candidate is indirectly supported by grant funding provided to the university of oxford by the wellcome trust and aeras global tuberculosis vaccine foundation 
we continue to actively pursue additional government sponsored development contracts and grants and to encourage both governmental and non governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations to provide development funding or to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair value of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab sab requires recognition of revenues from product sales that require no continuing performance on our part if four basic criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms  the fee is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have generated biothrax sales revenues under us government contracts with hhs and the dod 
under previous dod contracts  we invoiced the dod for progress payments upon reaching contractually specified stages in the manufacture of biothrax 
we recorded as deferred revenue the full amount of each progress payment invoice that we submitted to the dod 
title to the product passed to the dod upon submission of the first invoice 
the earnings process was considered complete upon fda release of the product for sale and distribution 
following fda release of the product  we segregated the product for later shipment and recognized as period revenue all deferred revenue related to the released product in accordance with the bill and hold sale requirements under sab at that time  we also invoiced the dod for the final progress payment and recognized the amount of that invoice as period revenue 
under previous contracts with hhs  we invoiced hhs and recognized the related revenues upon delivery of the product to the government carrier  at which time title to the product passed to hhs 
under our current contracts with hhs  we invoice hhs and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government at the delivery site  at which time title to the product passes to hhs 
under a collaboration agreement that we entered into with sanofi pasteur in may for our meningitis b vaccine candidate  we received an upfront license fee and were entitled to additional payments for development work under the collaboration 
we evaluated the various components of the collaboration in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
 which addresses whether  for revenue recognition purposes  there is one or several units of accounting in an arrangement 
we concluded that under eitf no 
 the license fee and the development work under our agreement with sanofi pasteur should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we recognized amounts received under this agreement over the estimated development period as we perform services 
we recorded the amount of the upfront license fee as deferred revenue 
prior to the termination of this agreement in december  we recognized this revenue over the estimated development period under the contract  estimated at seven years 
under the collaboration agreement  we were entitled to payments up to specified levels for development work we performed on behalf of sanofi pasteur 
we invoiced sanofi pasteur monthly in arrears  and recognized revenue in the period in which the associated costs were incurred 
from time to time  we are awarded reimbursement contracts for services and development grant contracts with government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations 
under these contracts  we typically are reimbursed for our costs in connection with specific development activities and may also be entitled to additional fees 
we record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contracts and grants revenue and the associated costs as research and development expense 
we issue invoices and recognize revenue upon incurring the reimbursable costs 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at invoice amounts and consist primarily of amounts due from hhs and the dod as well as amounts due under reimbursement contracts with other government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations 
because the collection history for receivables from these entities indicate that collection is likely  we do not currently record an allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
average cost consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses and includes the services and products of third party suppliers 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down in the applicable period inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected customer demand 
we also write off in the applicable period the costs related to expired inventory 
we capitalize the costs associated with the manufacture of biothrax as inventory from the initiation of the manufacturing process through the completion of manufacturing  labeling and packaging 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported on the balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in process research and development expenses  the anticipated future benefit of the net operating losses that we have incurred and other timing differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities 
we have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states  primarily maryland  and in some foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom 
the amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income 
the applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses as a result of ownership changes 
in particular  we believe that these rules will significantly limit our ability to use net operating losses generated by microscience limited  or microscience  and antex biologics  inc  or antex  prior to our acquisition of microscience in june and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of antex in may we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement  which reduces net income or increases net loss for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
if we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets  we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement  which increases net income or reduces net loss for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  on january  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated grant date fair values 
we value our share based payment transactions using the black scholes valuation model 
we measure the amount of compensation cost based on the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the effect of sfas no 
r on net income loss and net income loss per share in any period is not necessarily representative of the effects in future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options and the fair value of additional stock option grants in future years 
financial operations overview revenues between may and february  we supplied million doses of biothrax to hhs for inclusion in the strategic national stockpile  or sns  under a base contract for million doses for a fixed price of million and a contract modification for an additional million doses for a fixed price of million 
we completed delivery of all doses to hhs under the base contract and the contract modification in february on september   we entered into an agreement with hhs to supply million doses of biothrax to hhs for placement into the sns 
the term of the agreement is from september  through september  the first million doses delivered under this contract were sold to hhs at a discounted price  as specified in the contract  due to the limited remaining shelf life for those specific doses 
this discounted price does not apply to the final million doses under the contract 
the firm fixed price for the million doses  including the discount  is million in the aggregate 
through december   we have delivered approximately million doses under this contract 
if we receive fda approval of our pending supplement to our biologics license application  or bla  to extend the expiry dating of biothrax from three years to four years  hhs has agreed to increase the price per dose under the agreement for million doses sold under this contract 
in that event  hhs would make a lump sum payment to us reflecting an increase in the price per dose for specified doses delivered prior to such approval and pay an increased price per dose for doses delivered following the date of such approval 
the aggregate value of such price adjustment is approximately million 
if we do not receive fda approval of four year expiry dating during the term of the agreement there will be no adjustment in the price per dose under the agreement 
in december  based on data generated from our ongoing stability studies  we submitted a supplement to our bla for biothrax to extend the expiry dating 
we have received a complete response from the fda which posed a number of questions 
in responding to those questions  we submitted a separate supplement in december and submitted a response to the fda s complete response in february we believe that our application will be approved in under this agreement  we have also agreed to provide all shipping services related to delivery of doses into the sns over the term of the agreement  for which hhs has agreed to pay approximately million 
we invoice hhs for each delivery upon acceptance of biothrax doses delivered into the sns 
the agreement also provides for hhs to pay us up to million in milestone payments in connection with us advancing a program to obtain a post exposure prophylaxis indication for biothrax 
these funds are payable upon achievement of specific program milestones 
in october  we achieved the initial milestone and invoiced hhs for million 
we received this payment from hhs and revenue was recognized in november on september   we entered into an agreement with hhs to supply up to an additional million doses of biothrax to hhs for placement into the sns 
the term of the agreement is from september  through september  delivery of doses under the agreement will commence immediately following the anticipated completion of deliveries under our current million dose supply contract with hhs  currently anticipated in september  and continue through september funds for the procurement of the first million doses of biothrax have been committed 
procurement of the remaining million doses will be funded through the annual appropriations process for the sns 
if the fda approves our pending application to extend the shelf life of biothrax from three years to four years  and if four year dated lots of biothrax are available at the time of delivery of a particular lot or shipment  we must deliver four year dated product to the sns 
in the event the fda has not approved four year expiry dating at the time of such delivery  we may instead deliver three year dated product to the sns 
four year dated product will be invoiced at a higher price than three year dated product 
the total purchase price for the million doses will be between million and million  depending on product dating 
under the agreement  we have agreed to provide all shipping services related to delivery of doses into the sns over the term of the agreement  for which hhs has agreed to pay us approximately million 
we will invoice hhs under the agreement upon acceptance of each delivery of biothrax doses to the sns 
pursuant to two supply agreements for biothrax with the dod  we have supplied approximately million doses of biothrax for immunization of military personnel from through as a result of an october presidential directive that outlines the us government s objective to enhance coordination and cooperation among federal agencies with respect to countermeasure procurement and stockpile management  the dod is procuring additional doses of biothrax to satisfy ongoing requirements for its active immunization program directly from the sns 
consequently  we are not currently party to a procurement contract with the dod 
in september  we received a development contract from national institute of allergy and infectious disease  or niaid  valued at up to million  in support of non clinical and clinical studies of our anthrax immune globulin therapeutic candidate 
under the terms of the development contract  we are using the funds to conduct various studies on this product candidate  including non clinical efficacy studies and clinical trials 
in july  we were awarded two grants from niaid  totaling over million  to support development of our recombinant botulinum vaccine and advanced anthrax vaccine candidates 
in september  we received a million development contract from niaid and biomedical advanced research and development authority  or barda  to fund continued development of our anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic candidate  and a development contract with niaid and barda  valued at up to approximately million  to fund development of our advanced biothrax vaccine candidate 
in may  we entered into a collaboration agreement with sanofi pasteur  which was amended in june  under which we granted sanofi pasteur an exclusive  worldwide license under a proprietary technology to develop and commercialize a meningitis b vaccine candidate and received a million upfront license fee 
this agreement also provided for payments for development work under the collaboration 
in december  we and sanofi pasteur determined that the joint efforts on this collaboration had not identified a promising product candidate  and we mutually terminated the collaboration 
upon termination we recognized as revenue the unamortized portion of the upfront license fee 
on december   we entered into an agreement with pfizer inc whereby pfizer acquired from us technology  materials and related documentation pertaining to our pertussis  or whooping cough  product candidate 
under the terms of the agreement  pfizer paid million for all pertussis technology  product material  data  technical and scientific information  intellectual property  know how  expertise and trade secrets  as well as standard operating procedures  batch records  historical manufacturing records and regulatory documentation relating to the technology 
in addition  pfizer will pay us a future milestone payment of up to  pending the results of ongoing work with the technology 
our revenue  operating results and profitability have varied  and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis  primarily because of the timing of our fulfilling orders for biothrax and work done under new and existing contracts and grants 
cost of product sales the primary expense that we incur to deliver biothrax to our customers is manufacturing costs  which are primarily fixed costs 
these fixed manufacturing costs consist of facilities  utilities and salaries and personnel related expenses for indirect manufacturing support staff 
variable manufacturing costs for biothrax consist primarily of costs for materials  direct labor and contract filling operations 
we determine the cost of product sales for doses sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period those doses were manufactured 
we calculate the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period of manufacture by dividing the actual costs of manufacturing in such period by the number of units produced in that period 
in addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above  the average manufacturing cost per dose depends on the efficiency of the manufacturing process  utilization of available manufacturing capacity and the production yield for the period of production 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees to professional service providers for  among other things  preclinical and analytical testing  independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non clinical studies  costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital assets used to develop our products  and operating costs  such as the operating cost of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates 
we expect that development spending for our product pipeline will increase as our product development activities continue based on ongoing advancement of our product candidates  and as we prepare for regulatory submissions and other regulatory activities 
we expect that the magnitude of any increase in our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials  the size  structure and duration of any follow on clinical programs that we may initiate  costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large scale basis for later stage clinical trials  and our ability to use or rely on data generated by government agencies  such as the ongoing studies with biothrax being conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention  or cdc 
in july  we entered into a joint venture with the university of oxford and certain university of oxford researchers to conduct clinical trials in the advancement of a vaccine candidate for tuberculosis  resulting in the formation of the oxford emergent tuberculosis consortium 
as part of this arrangement  we have entered into a license agreement with the joint venture pursuant to which we obtained rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical compositions intended to prevent or treat mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans in developed countries 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to the joint venture over the next three years to support a phase iib proof of concept study in humans  primarily in the form of services to be performed by our personnel on behalf of the joint venture 
the university of oxford s contributions include support from the wellcome trust and the aeras global tuberculosis vaccine foundation for the phase iib clinical trial in the form of cash and services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  sales and marketing  business development  finance  accounting  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales or research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we currently market and sell biothrax directly to hhs with a small  targeted marketing and sales group 
as we seek to broaden the market for biothrax and if we receive marketing approval for additional products  we expect that we will increase our spending for marketing and sales activities 
total other income expense total other income expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense 
we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents  and we incur interest expense on our indebtedness 
we capitalize interest expense in accordance with sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  based on the cost of major ongoing projects which have not yet been placed in service  such as our new manufacturing facility 
our total interest cost will increase in future periods as compared to prior periods as a result of the term loan that we entered into in june  as well as any borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
in addition  some of our existing debt arrangements provide for increasing amortization of principal payments in future periods 
see liquidity and capital resources debt financing for additional information 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues product sales revenues decreased by  or  to million for from million for this decrease in product sales revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the number of doses of biothrax delivered  offset by a increase in the average sales price per dose attributable to a discounted price provided to hhs due to the limited remaining shelf life for certain doses delivered in the third and fourth quarters of product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million and aggregate international and other sales of million

the spending for the anthrax monoclonal therapeutic candidate was primarily due to the purchase of this vaccine candidate and related technology in march and continued advancement of this product candidate 
the decrease in spending for our botulinum vaccine candidates resulted from enhanced spending in from advancing this program to the process development stage and the manufacture of clinical trial material  coupled with lower spending in and going forward as we have scaled back our development efforts on our botulinum toxoid vaccine candidate pending the receipt of third party development funding 
the increase in spending on commercial product candidates  detailed in the table below  primarily reflects additional personnel and contracted services 
the increase in spending for typhella resulted from the manufacture of clinical material and initiating and conducting a phase iib study in the us  which commenced in the second quarter of the decrease in spending for our hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine candidate resulted from the cessation of new patient enrollment from our ongoing phase ii clinical trial in the united kingdom and serbia as a result of patient recruiting difficulties because we administer our product candidate as a montherapy 
the spending for our group b streptococcus vaccine candidate resulted from preparing for phase i clinical trials for two of the protein components of the vaccine candidate 
we have decided not to proceed with these trials and  as a result  we expect that spending for our group b streptococcus vaccine candidate will be significantly reduced in the future 
the spending for our tuberculosis vaccine candidate related to the formation of our joint venture with the university of oxford in july and preparation for a phase iib clinical trial 
the decrease in spending for our chlamydia vaccine candidate  which is in preclinical development  is related to slowing development while seeking external funding

our line of credit with fifth third bank is secured by accounts receivable under our hhs and dod contracts 
our term loan with hsbc realty credit corporation is secured by substantially all of emergent biodefense operations assets  other than accounts receivable under our hhs and dod contracts 
the covenants under our existing debt instruments and the pledge of our existing assets as collateral limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing

tax benefits in connection with our facility expansion in lansing  the state of michigan and the city of lansing have provided us a variety of tax credits and abatements 
we estimate that the total value of these tax benefits may be up to million over a period of up to years  beginning in these tax benefits are primarily based on our million planned investment in our lansing facility 
in addition  we must maintain a specified number of employees in lansing to continue to qualify for these tax benefits 
funding requirements we expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements from existing cash and cash equivalents  revenues from biothrax product sales and other committed sources of funding 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biothrax product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we may seek to raise additional external debt financing to provide additional financial flexibility 
our committed external sources of funds consist of the borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit with fifth third bank and grant and development funding of our anthrax immune globulin therapeutic product candidate  recombinant botulinum vaccine candidate  anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic candidate and advanced biothrax vaccine candidate 
our ability to borrow additional amounts under our loan agreements is subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level and timing of biothrax product sales and cost of product sales  the timing of  and the costs involved in qualification and validation activities related to our new manufacturing facility in lansing  michigan and  if we proceed  the build out of our manufacturing facility in frederick  maryland  the scope  progress  results and costs of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number of  and development requirements for  other product candidates that we may pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  our ability to obtain development funding from government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations 
we may require additional sources of funds for future acquisitions that we may make or  depending on the size of the obligation  to meet balloon payments upon maturity of our current borrowings 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
additional equity or debt financing  grants  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our planned commercialization efforts 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that have maturities of less than three months 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but would likely increase the interest expense associated with our debt
