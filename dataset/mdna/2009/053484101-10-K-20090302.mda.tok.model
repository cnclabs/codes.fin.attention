total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership  either during construction or upon construction completion  represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount 
future initial occupancy dates are estimates 
there can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments 
stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of or greater physical occupancy or ii the one year anniversary of completion of development 
this community is being financed in part by third party  tax exempt debt 
redevelopment communities as of december   we had seven consolidated communities under redevelopment 
we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be  excluding costs prior to redevelopment 
in addition  the fund has two communities under redevelopment 
we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community 
accordingly  we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community 
we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations  or that we will meet our budgeted costs  either individually or in the aggregate 
we anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to fund owned communities  as well as communities in our current operating portfolio 
you should carefully review item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity

restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of or greater physical occupancy or ii the one year anniversary of completion of redevelopment 
this community is owned by the fund 
development rights as of december   we are evaluating the future development of new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us  under contract  subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option 
we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land  although for of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 
the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately 
we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add  apartment homes to our portfolio 
substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 
at december   there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs  but excluding land costs of  relating to development rights that we consider probable for future development 
in addition  land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of  are reflected as land held for development as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process 
the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in  if any  or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made  are business judgments that we make after we perform financial  demographic and other analyses 
in the event that we do not proceed with a development right  we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities  unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land  however  we cannot guarantee a recovery 
pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are charged to expense 
during  we incurred a charge of approximately  of pre development cost for development rights that we determined would not likely be developed 
refer to item i  business for a discussion of our expected development starts 
in addition  you should carefully review section a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights

land acquisitions we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development 
during  we acquired six land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  one of which we no longer plan to develop 
the land parcels purchased  which are currently being developed or are held for future development  are as follows estimated total number capitalized gross of apartment cost date acres homes millions acquired avalon ballard january seattle  wa avalon north bergen may north bergen  nj avalon norwalk july norwalk  ct avalon willoughby west november december new york  ny avalon at the pinehills  phase ii december plymouth  ma total total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date if any and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community  determined in accordance with gaap  including land acquisition costs  construction costs  real estate taxes  capitalized interest and loan fees  permits  professional fees  allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees 
this represents a portion of the aggregate land purchase that we will transact under a non cancelable commitment related to this expected development  as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
recent disposition activity we i sell assets that do not meet our long term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop  redevelop and acquire communities 
pending such redeployment  we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility 
on occasion  we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a non taxable  like kind exchange transaction 
from january  to january   we sold our interest in ten wholly owned communities  containing an aggregate of  apartment homes 
the aggregate gross sales price from the dispositions of these assets was  insurance and risk of uninsured losses we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities 
these policies  and other insurance policies we carry  have policy specifications  insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured  in full or in part  because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it  in management s view  economically impractical 
you should carefully review the discussion under item a  risk factors  of this form k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 
many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults 
many of our communities are near  and thus susceptible to  the major fault lines in california  including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault 
we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels 
we have in place with respect to communities located in california  for any single occurrence and in the aggregate   of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building 
earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a  limit  except with respect to the state of washington  for which the limit is  our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a  deductible per occurrence except that the next  of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible until the total deductible incurred exceeds on december   we elected to cancel and rewrite our property insurance policy for a month term in order to take advantage of declining insurance premium rates 
as a result  our property insurance premium decreased by approximately with no material changes in coverage 
we expect to renew this policy when it expires on may  in august  we renewed our general liability policy and worker s compensation coverage for a one year term  and experienced a decrease in the premium on these policies of approximately  with no material changes in the coverage 
these policies are in effect until august  just as with office buildings  transportation systems and government buildings  there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism 
in december  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back stop program until in connection with this legislation  we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to  additionally  we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts  not covered under tripra  such as domestic based terrorism 
this insurance  often referred to as non certified terrorism insurance  is subject to deductibles  limits and exclusions 
our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 
an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 
for further discussion of the risks and the company s related prevention and remediation activities  please refer to the discussion under item a  risk factors we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non compliance  elsewhere in this report 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 
we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company  up to  per occurrence  from employee theft of money  securities or property 
item legal proceedings on july   we filed a complaint in the us district court  eastern district of virginia alexandria  against tetra tech  inc and tetra tech mm  inc collectively  tetra tech and arthur willden  a tetra tech employee during the relevant period and the brother of our former employee  james r 
willden 
our complaint alleges that portions of payments made by avalonbay to tetra tech were improperly passed on by tetra tech to san jose water conservation corp 
we previously obtained judgments against james willden  san jose water conservation corp  and michael schroll  the president of san jose water conservation corp 
tetra tech has filed a counterclaim and cross complaint against avalonbay and others seeking damages in excess of million 
we believe that tetra tech s counterclaim is without merit with respect to avalonbay and intend to vigorously defend such claim 
our insurer  as subrogee  will have a claim to a portion of recoveries we collect  if any  from james willden  san jose water conservation corp  michael schroll and or tetra tech 
there can be no assurance that any meaningful amount will be collected in recovery or that we will be successful in our litigation with tetra tech 
we are currently involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act fha and the americans with disabilities act 
the equal rights center filed a complaint against us on september  in the us district court  district of maryland with respect to properties 
the lawsuit seeks monetary damages as well as injunctive relief  such as modifications to assets 
the company has filed a motion to dismiss all or parts of the suit  which has not been ruled on yet by the court 
on august   the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york filed a civil lawsuit against the company and the joint venture cvp i  llc in which it has an interest that owns avalon chrystie place 
the lawsuit alleges that avalon chrystie place was not designed and constructed in accordance with the accessibility requirements of the fha 
the company designed and constructed avalon chrystie place with a view to compliance with new york city s local law  which for more than years has been new york city s code regulating the accessible design and construction of apartments  and which we believe satisfies the requirements of the fha 
due to the preliminary nature of the equal rights center and department of justice matters  we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters  nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement 
on august   we filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of washington in the county of king avalon downreit v  lp v 
grand glacier  llc et al relating to our assertion that the homeowners association in which our former avalon wynhaven community is a part systematically overcharged us for various shared costs 
we recently sold this property and agreed to indemnify the buyer for annual association fees to the extent they exceed an amount that we each agreed was reasonable 
the defendants have filed a cross claim against avalon downreit v  lp seeking foreclosure of the property and satisfaction of all amounts alleged to be due 
we intend to vigorously pursue our claim and defend against the counter claim 
we cannot predict the likely terms of a final judgment or settlement 
in addition to the matters described above  we are involved in various other claims and or administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
while no assurances can be given  we do not believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our operations

these dividends were paid in cash and common shares 
see discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the special dividend was declared to distribute a portion of the excess income attributable to gains on asset sales from the company s disposition activities during  as discussed in note  real estate disposition activities  elsewhere in this report 
the special dividend is intended to qualify for the dividends paid deduction for tax purposes and minimize corporate level income taxes for and reduce federal excise taxes

under this definition  ebitda includes gains on sale of assets and gain on sale of partnership interests 
management generally considers ebitda to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  as an indicator of our operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
our calculation of ebitda may not be comparable to ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we generally consider funds from operations  or ffo  as defined below  to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report 
current communities consist of all communities other than those which are still under construction and have not received a certificate of occupancy 
consistent with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  we calculate ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities  extraordinary gains or losses as defined by gaap  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  depreciation of real estate assets  and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent net income in accordance with gaap  and therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income  which remains the primary measure  as an indication of our performance 
in addition  ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo 
ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs

actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this report 
executive overview business description we are primarily engaged in developing  acquiring  owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
we believe that apartment communities are an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
however  throughout the real estate cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets  which are located in new england  the new york new jersey metro area  the mid atlantic  the midwest  the pacific northwest  and the northern and southern california regions of the united states 
our strategy is to penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer 
our communities are predominately upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
however  we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
financial highlights and outlook for the year ended december   net income available to common stockholders was  compared to  for  an increase of 
the annual year over year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in gains from the sale of communities and joint venture real estate investments in as compared to and growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in  partially offset by non cash charges for land impairments  abandoned pursuit costs and other charges related to our reduction in our planned development activity and other items listed in the table below 
net income and eps ffo decrease increase full year amount per share land impairments severance and related costs federal excise tax fund ii organizational costs gain on medium term notes repurchase preferred stock deferred offering expenses increase in abandoned pursuit costs per share amounts are computed using the weighted average common shares diluted at december  apartment fundamentals  while in line with expectations  were challenged in the second half of as the recent economic downturn accelerated 
we were able to achieve full year over year rental revenue growth of for our established community portfolio  comprised entirely of an increase in rental rates of  with no change in occupancy 
this revenue growth  combined with constrained expense growth  contributed to our established community portfolio achieving year over year growth in net operating income noi of in however  due to the decline in market fundamentals during the fourth quarter of  rental revenue from established communities increased and noi increased over the prior year period 
we expect a decrease in earnings per share diluted eps in from the prior year of approximately  driven primarily by the decrease in expected dispositions for contributing to these results will be an expected decline in the revenue and net operating income from our established communities in the recession  coupled with the short term nature of apartment leases  has adversely impacted current operating fundamentals 
while certain apartment markets continue to exhibit positive trends  the negative impact on renter demand from net job losses is expected to result in year over year declines in noi 
we believe that the adverse impact of the recession will be somewhat offset by i the expected continued weakness in the for sale housing market during and ii growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent 
in addition  the level of new rental completions in the company s markets is anticipated to decline during from levels 
our current financial outlook for provides for a decline in rental revenue of between and in our established community portfolio and a projected noi decline of to 
while current capital market conditions continue to adversely affect access to liquidity  we were able to demonstrate the benefits of the financial flexibility that comes with a largely unencumbered capital structure 
during the year ended december   we raised in excess of  of capital through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt  sales of assets  and joint venture partner capital commitments 
during we sourced approximately  in debt at attractive prices from a variety of sources  including the government sponsored enterprises  tax exempt debt  money center banks and even a local bank for long term secured debt 
in addition  we achieved a record level of dispositions during  selling eleven communities including one held by the fund for an aggregate gross sales price of  we anticipate our level of disposition activity to be in the range of gross sales of  to  in however  our actual disposition activity may differ significantly and will depend on various factors including market and economic conditions in we used the proceeds from both the debt financing activity and community dispositions to fund our development and redevelopment activities  reduce amounts drawn under our unsecured line of credit  repay secured and unsecured debt  prepay certain secured debt with higher interest costs and repurchase common stock 
capital needs result primarily from development expenditures  maturing debt and dividend requirements 
our committed capital is sufficient to complete the development underway and meet other liquidity uses 
see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
while we believe that our development activity will continue to create long term value  we reduced our expected level of development in response to the general deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions  the general recessionary environment 
as previously disclosed  we do not anticipate starting any new development during the first half of development starts in the second half of  if any  will be evaluated based on our assessment of economic and capital market conditions at that time 
we do expect to increase redevelopment activity in for both wholly owned and fund as defined below related assets 
as a result of the reduction in our development activities  we incurred certain non cash and other charges as discussed in the table above 
during we completed communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of  while only starting six communities  which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of  during  the company expects to disburse approximately  related to the communities under development at december  and expected acquisitions of land for future development 
we expect approximately  of the projected disbursements will be funded from cash in escrow related to previously sourced tax exempt debt 
our financial plan anticipates a continuation of poor credit markets and constrained liquidity 
however  we believe that our current level of indebtedness  our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our current development and redevelopment activities 
we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt and or common and preferred equity and secured debt  as well as from disposition proceeds  joint ventures or from retained cash 
we believe that the current market provides for an opportunity to perform certain deferred maintenance and repositioning activities at attractive costs due to the continued decline in costs for construction materials and labor 
during  we expect to start redevelopments of wholly owned communities  as well as five redevelopments of communities on behalf of the fund  as defined below 
avalonbay value added fund  lp the fund is a discretionary investment fund with nine institutional investors  including us 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of the fund and has invested approximately  in the fund  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
the fund was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in march on september   we announced the formation of avalonbay value added fund ii  lp fund ii  a private  discretionary investment vehicle with commitments from four institutional investors including us totaling  we have committed  to fund ii  representing a equity interest 
at final closing  the aggregate investor commitments to fund ii and our commitment and percentage interest in fund ii may change 
fund ii can employ leverage of up to  allowing for a total investment capacity of approximately  and has a term of ten years plus two one year extension options 
fund ii will acquire and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in our current markets with the objective of creating value through redevelopment  enhanced operations and or improving market fundamentals 
fund ii will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investments in apartment communities for a period of three years from the closing date or until of its committed capital is invested  subject to limited exceptions 
fund ii will not include or involve our development activities 
we will receive  in addition to any returns on its invested equity  asset management fees  property management fees and redevelopment fees 
we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met 
as of december   there has been no capital contributed to fund ii and fund ii has made no investments 
in the fourth quarter of  fund ii entered into a  unsecured credit facility  with an option to increase the facility up to  subject to certain lender requirements 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus per annum  and matures in december  assuming the exercise of a one year extension option 
at december   there was  outstanding under the fund ii credit facility 
communities overview our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights ie  land or options to purchase land held for development  as further described in item of this report 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities 
discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
noi of our current operating communities  is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance 
noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
as of december   we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which communities were under construction and nine communities were under reconstruction 
of these communities  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes  including owned by the fund 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities  noi derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of noi related to disposed communities  and capital market and financing activity

net income available to common stockholders increased  or in over the prior year period due primarily to sales of consolidated operating communities and investments in unconsolidated entities and related gains combined with growth in noi from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities 
noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level or financing related costs 
noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs

during  we continued to focus on rental rate growth  while maintaining occupancy of at least in all regions 
we anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will decline in such that overall rental revenue will decline between and as compared to the growth achieved in the expected revenue decline is due to the general decline in overall economic conditions and related employment levels 
expense growth also impacts growth in noi and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth 
we expect operating expenses to increase between and in from prior year levels  attributable primarily to increases in property taxes  utilities  insurance and office operations 
as a result  we expect noi for our established communities to decline between and 
these projections are based on our outlook for economic conditions in  both nationally and in the markets where we operate 
there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions and or their impact on our operating results will be accurate  and actual results could differ materially

net operating income noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level or financing related costs 
noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes 
rental and other income increased in as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities  coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes decreased to  apartment homes for as compared to  homes for and  homes for this change is primarily the result of communities sold during containing  apartment homes  as well as declining occupancy levels due to the economic slow down  partially offset by increased homes available from newly developed communities 
the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  for as compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue increased  or  for and increased  or  for these increases are due entirely to increased average rental rates 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to increased market rents 
there was no change in year over year average economic occupancy for economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we experienced increases in established communities rental revenue in all six of our regions for as compared to the prior year period 
the largest percentage increases in rental revenue were in the northern california and pacific northwest regions  with increases of and  respectively  between years 
almost of our established community revenue is generated by the metro new york new jersey  northern california and the new england regions  and are discussed in more detail below 
the metro new york new jersey region  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue for  experienced an increase in rental revenue of for as compared to average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy decreased to for as compared to during the trend of weakening rental market conditions in both new york city and surrounding suburban markets resulting from the recession is reflected in the declining occupancy levels in the second half of the challenges facing the financial services industry are expected to continue throughout resulting in a further decline in employment levels 
we will remain focused on the current market conditions  as we seek to manage the resulting impact on our community operating results for northern california  which represented approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of as compared to average rental rates increased by to  and economic occupancy declined by from to for as compared to we expect northern california to see a modest decline in revenue in the new england region accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced rental revenue growth of over the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy increased to for  as compared to given the significance of the financial services industry in the boston metro area  as well as the impact of new york trends on fairfield new haven  we continue to monitor the recent decline in job growth as compared to due to the current volatility in the financial services industry 
in accordance with gaap  cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term  which is generally one year 
as a supplemental measure  we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 
rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions  as well as current rental market conditions 
the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years and dollars in thousands 
information for the year ended december  is not presented  as established community classification is not comparable prior to january  see note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended rental revenue gaap basis concessions amortized concessions granted rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis year over year change gaap revenue n a year over year change cash concession based revenue n a management  development and other fees increased  or in and decreased  or in the increase in was due primarily to increased redevelopment fees and property management fees as additional communities were acquired by the fund 
the decrease in was due primarily to lower development and redevelopment management fees coupled with the disposition of our interest in a joint venture  partially offset by increased management fees from fund communities 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased  or in and increased  or for as compared to the prior year periods  primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  or to  for and  or to  for  due primarily to increased utilities  administrative and community maintenance related costs  offset partially by a decrease in insurance and payroll related expenses 
the increases in administrative expense are primarily due to increases in bad debt  due to a general decline in the economic climate 
property taxes increased  or and  or in and  respectively  due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments 
property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 
for established communities  property taxes increased by  or and  or for and  respectively due to both higher assessments throughout all regions and reductions in property taxes realized in that did not occur in the impact of the current economic environment has not been reflected in current assessments  as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments 
we expect property taxes in to increase over due primarily to higher tax rates  without the benefit of lower assessed values 
property tax increases are limited by law proposition for communities in california 
we evaluate property tax increases internally  as well as engage third party consultants  and appeal increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by  or in and  or in over the prior year periods 
these increases are due primarily to increased compensation and employee separation costs  as well as costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities 
the expense includes transition and ongoing costs related to our customer care center in virginia beach  virginia that we opened in the third quarter of to centralize certain community related accounting  administrative and customer service functions 
investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions  investment management and abandoned pursuit costs  which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development  as well as the abandonment of development pursuits  acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits 
investments and investment management costs increased in and compared to the prior year periods due primarily to increases in abandoned pursuit costs 
abandoned pursuit costs were  in   in and  in the increase in abandoned pursuit costs in is due to the reduction in our planned development activity 
these costs can be volatile  particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital  and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future periods 
interest expense  net increased  or and decreased  or in and  respectively 
this category includes both interest expense and interest income 
the increase in is due primarily to a decrease in interest income in as compared to the prior year period  coupled with increased interest expense in compared to the higher level of interest income in is due to higher invested cash balances from our january equity offering 
the increased interest expense in is due primarily to increased amounts of debt outstanding in compared to the prior year period 
in addition  interest expense in was reduced by including the gain of  recognized by repurchasing  of our  unsecured notes at a discount of of par for  interest expense also includes charges of approximately  related to unamortized deferred financing costs and purchase premiums for debt that was repaid prior to its scheduled maturity 
depreciation expense increased in and primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities 
general and administrative expense g a increased  or in and increased  or in as compared to the prior year periods 
the increase is due primarily to compensation  including severance and related costs associated with the decrease in our planned development activity  federal excise tax expense resulting from gains on our increased disposition activity during and organization costs for the formation of fund ii 
the increase is primarily due to increased compensation costs 
impairment loss for is due primarily to the write down of eight land parcels which we have decided to not develop 
we did not recognize an impairment loss in either or equity in income of unconsolidated entities for decreased from the prior year period due primarily to the gain on the sale of two partnership interests in and the related loss of partnership income  partially offset by our portion of the gain from the sale of a community by a joint venture partner  income from joint ventures where the underlying communities have achieved stabilized operations and gains from our investment in a joint venture formed to develop for sale homes 
the increase in over the prior year period is due primarily to approximately  in gains from the dispositions of two investments in minority interest in consolidated partnerships for resulted in income of  compared to expense of  in due to recognition of income for our joint venture partners portion of the net loss incurred by fund ii  as well as the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in and  thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 
the increase in over the prior year period is due primarily to the recognition in of the sale of a joint venture partner interest in one of our unconsolidated communities  partially offset by the redemption of limited partnership units  as discussed above 
gain on sale of land for decreased from the prior year period due to the absence of land sales in gain on sale of land from decreased from due to the volume and size of parcels sold each year 
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january  through december  this income decreased for and due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period 
see note  real estate disposition activities  of our consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of communities increased in and as compared to the prior year periods as a result of a higher volume of sales in each respective year 
the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 
funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ffo ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance 
in calculating ffo  we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates 
ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere this report 
for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo  see selected financial data  included in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities including dispositions  as well as general economic and market conditions 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flows from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of debt service and maturity payments  normal recurring operating expenses  downreit partnership unit distributions  and capital calls for the fund and fund ii  as required 
the capital and credit markets contracted significantly during  resulting in a constrained liquidity environment 
although general market liquidity was constrained  we were able to satisfy our liquidity needs from a combination of cash flows provided by secured and unsecured financings  proceeds from asset sales and cash from operations 
in  we continue to expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources  including borrowing capacity under our credit facility as defined below  secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below  as well as our operating activities 
to the extent that currently available internal and external resources do not satisfy our needs  we may seek additional external financing 
additional external financing could come from a variety of sources  such as public sales of debt or equity securities or unsecured or secured loans from financial institutions or other private or governmental lenders  among others 
private equity through joint ventures may also be used 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short term financial prospects 
at december   we have unrestricted cash and cash in escrow of  available for development activities 
for the year ended december  we raised in excess of  of capital through the issuance of secured debt and unsecured debt  equity commitments from private equity sources and sales of assets 
we used these proceeds to fund our development and redevelopment activities  reduce amounts drawn under our unsecured line of credit  repay secured and unsecured debt  prepay certain unsecured debt with interest costs above prevailing rates and repurchase our common and preferred stock 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   an increase of  from  at december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease was driven primarily by the payment of interest amounts and the timing of general corporate payables  partially offset by the additional noi from our established communities  as well as noi from recently developed communities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through the development and redevelopment of apartment communities  partially offset by the gross proceeds from the disposition of communities in the amount of  and an increase in construction escrows of  during  we invested  in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures we acquired six parcels of land in connection with development rights  for a purchase price of approximately  we had capital expenditures of  for real estate and non real estate assets 
we invested approximately  in the development of communities  including the commencement of the development of six communities which are expected to contain an aggregate of  apartment homes for an expected aggregate total capitalized cost of financing activities net cash used by financing activities totaled  in the net cash used is due primarily to the payment of cash dividends in the amount of  the redemption of preferred stock for  and the repurchase of  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  offset somewhat by the net issuance of secured and unsecured debt of  including amounts repaid under our credit facility as defined below 
in february  our board of directors authorized an increase of  in our common stock repurchase program  increasing the total amount the company can acquire to  of which approximately  has been used to repurchase our common stock as of december  the decision to use the additional share repurchase authorization will depend on current capital market conditions and liquidity  our share price relative to the net asset value per share and other uses of capital  including development 
in october  we exercised our option to redeem all  outstanding shares of our series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock for  the repayment amount includes the redemption value of the outstanding shares of per share and accrued but unpaid dividends through the redemption date 
we recorded a non cash charge for deferred offering expenses of approximately  in the fourth quarter of related to this redemption 
variable rate unsecured credit facility we currently have a  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in november assuming our exercise of a one year renewal option 
in the aggregate  we pay an annual facility fee of approximately  the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on january  
the spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based on our credit rating 
in addition  a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january  at january    was outstanding on the credit facility   was used to provide letters of credit  and  was available for borrowing under the credit facility 
we are subject to certain customary financial and other covenants under the credit facility  our  variable rate  unsecured term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued 
the financial covenants include the following limitation on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure  limitation on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property specific financing  and minimum levels of debt service coverage 
we are in compliance with these covenants at december  future financing and capital needs debt maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid substantially prior to maturity 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our credit facility or by equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory

during  we sold communities including one community sold by the fund 
absent a special distribution in excess of our normal  recurring quarterly dividend  we would have had taxable income in excess of distributions resulting in federal income tax at the corporate level 
to qualify for the dividends paid deduction for tax purposes and minimize this potential tax  in december we declared a combined special and regular dividend the combined dividend of per share  comprised of a special dividend of the special dividend per share and our regular dividend of per share 
the company recorded a charge of  related to the expected federal excise taxes related to the gains on sale recognized during future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as of december   we had new communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we had nine communities which we own  or in which we have a direct or indirect interest  under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction  as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights  will be funded from cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements  and short term investment vehicles  the remaining capacity under our  credit facility  retained operating cash  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or private equity funding  including joint venture activity 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the fund or fund ii as discussed below  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
on september   we announced the formation of fund ii  a private  discretionary investment vehicle with commitments from us and four institutional investors 
fund ii has equity commitments totaling  we have committed  to the fund  representing a equity interest 
fund ii will acquire and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in our current markets with the objective of creating value through redevelopment  enhanced operations and or improving market fundamentals 
fund ii will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investments in apartment communities until  or earlier when of its committed capital is invested  subject to limited exceptions 
fund ii will not include or involve our development activities 
we will receive  in addition to any returns on our invested equity  asset management fees  property management fees and redevelopment fees 
we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met 
as of january   there have been no capital contributions to fund ii  and fund ii has not made any investments 
in the fourth quarter of  fund ii entered into a  unsecured credit facility  with an option to increase the facility up to  subject to certain lender requirements 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus per annum  and matures in december  assuming the exercise of a one year extension option 
at december   there was  outstanding under the fund ii credit facility 
from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity 
we may also use joint ventures related to mixed use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses and noi 
however  we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities  we have certain off balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest 
additional discussion of these entities can be found in note  investments in real estate entities  of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 
cvp i  llc has outstanding tax exempt  variable rate bonds maturing in november in the amount of  which have permanent credit enhancement 
we have agreed to guarantee  under limited circumstances  the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of cvp i  llc s repayment obligations under the bonds 
we have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that cvp i  llc will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project chrystie place in new york city overall once tenant improvements related to a retail tenant are complete  which is expected in our partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under these guarantees  both at inception and as of december  were not significant 
as a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at december  the fund has loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of  these mortgage loans have varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid  ranging from october to september these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 
the fund has two credit facilities that mature in december the fund had  outstanding as of december  under its credit facilities 
the mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the fund with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate  and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments 
we have not guaranteed the debt of the fund  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the fund be unable to do so 
in addition  as part of the formation of the fund  we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee 
the guarantee provides that if  upon final liquidation of the fund  the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the fund whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner  then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall  but in no event more than of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately  as of december  
as of december   the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by the fund is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected fund liquidation scenario 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december  mvp i  llc  the entity that owns avalon at mission bay north ii  has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for  the loan is a fixed rate  interest only note bearing interest at  maturing in december we have not guaranteed the debt of mvp i  llc  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should mvp i  llc be unable to do so

the llc has two separate variable rate loans with aggregate borrowings of  and an interest rate of at december  in addition  aria at hathorne has a short term variable rate note for approximately  at an interest rate of due in we have not guaranteed the debt of aria at hathorne  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should aria at hathorne be unable to do so 
phvp i  llc  a consolidated joint venture in which we hold a controlling interest  is constructing a public garage adjacent to our walnut creek development 
as part of the construction management services we provide to phvp i  llc for the construction of the public garage  we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing 
our obligations under this guarantee terminate upon i the issuance of a certificate of substantial completion and ii completion of a list of lender requirements 
the certificate of substantial completion was issued on july  and the completion of the lender s requirements list is nearing completion 
we expect termination of the guarantee in the first half of in we entered into a non cancelable commitment the commitment to acquire parcels of land in brooklyn  new york for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  under the terms of the commitment  we will close on the various parcels over a period determined by the seller s ability to execute unrelated purchase transactions and achieve deferral of gains for the land sold under this commitment 
however  under no circumstances will the commitment extend beyond  at which time either we or the seller can compel execution of the remaining transactions 
at december   we have an outstanding commitment to purchase the remaining land for approximately there are no other lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us 
in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage  management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 
contractual obligations we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an operating land lease agreement relating to our avalon walnut creek community currently under development 
aside from this lease  there have not been any other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes  outstanding under our variable rate credit facility as of december  the table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in see liquidity and capital resources 
amounts exclude interest payable as of december  includes land leases expiring between november and march amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases 
inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in an inflationary environment  this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different assumptions were made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies  including further discussion of the accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements  applying the guidance of fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised and emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
for investment interests that we do not consolidate  we look to the guidance in aicpa statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures  accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  and emerging issues task force topic d  accounting for limited partnership investments  to determine the accounting framework to apply 
the application of these rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
therefore  we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 
if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december   our assets would have increased by  and our liabilities would have increased by  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed  including but not limited to the following reasons  none of which are currently expected to occur for entities not considered to be variable interest entities under fin r  the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary 
for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and or variable interest  the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and or variable interest 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
for redevelopment efforts  we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed  or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct and those indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities 
these costs include interest and related loan fees  property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs 
interest is capitalized for any project specific financing  as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects 
indirect project costs  which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized 
the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment  and as such  we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 
there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to development or redevelopment activity 
if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs  there may be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if in our development activities decreased by  and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs  our operating expenses would have increased by we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the acquisition or development of an apartment community  and therefore should be capitalized  the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate 
if it were determined that of our capitalized pursuits were no longer probable of occurring  net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by  asset impairment evaluation we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas for our consolidated operating apartment communities  development communities and development rights to determine the need for performing impairment analyses  as well as to measure the loss if an impairment has occurred on a regular basis  considering qualitative economic factors 
we also apply the provisions of sfas for assessing the need to perform an impairment analysis and measuring impairment losses on the underlying long lived assets held by our unconsolidated joint venture investments 
in addition  we apply the provisions of apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb  to determine if there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures 
because each asset is unique  requiring significant management judgment  we believe that the asset impairment evaluation under sfas  and the assessment of other than temporary declines in fair value under apb  are critical accounting estimates 
for both analyses  management judgment is required both to determine if a significant event has occurred  such that an impairment analysis is necessary  as well as for the assessment and measurement of any potential impairment 
under apb  in the event that there has been a loss in value for an investment  a loss is only recognized if it is other than temporary which requires management judgment 
to perform the sfas impairment analysis  we must estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset  which in the case of an apartment community would be the cash flows from operations and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset 
forecasting cash flows requires assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period  rental rates  occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period  as well as disposition proceeds 
in addition  when an impairment has occurred  we must estimate the discount factor  or market capitalization rate  to apply to the undiscounted cash flows to derive the fair value of the position 
the market capitalization rate is influenced by many factors  including national and local economic conditions  as well as the location and quality of the asset 
our analysis of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under apb considers our ability to recover the carrying amount of our investment by evaluating the current fair value of the net assets underlying the investment using our estimate of the forecasted cash flows that the asset will generate  including any incremental cash flows from investment management or other fees related to the investment  disposition proceeds and an estimated market capitalization rate 
our estimate of the fees considers various factors  including any contractually guaranteed amounts and expected periods over which the fees will be earned 
in the event that the current fair value of our investment  considering the above factors  is less than our current carrying basis  an impairment exists 
we must then determine if the impairment is other than temporary 
whether an impairment is other than temporary is a subjective determination  primarily considering the ability of the joint venture entity to generate cash flows from operations  the expected proceeds from the disposition of our position  and whether our expected investment horizon is adequate to recover any unrealized loss in the fair value of our investment 
changes in the future cash flows associated with an asset have a direct  linear relationship to the fair value of the position 
for example  holding all other variables constant  if there is a decline in the estimated cash flows from operations for a community  there would be a corresponding decrease in the fair value of that asset of 
changes in the market capitalization rate have an inverse relationship with the fair value of an asset  with a decrease in the market capitalization rate resulting in an increase in the fair value of the asset 
for example  an asset that is valued at  when using a five percent market capitalization rate will increase in value to  if the market capitalization rate decreases by one percent to four percent  and to  if the market capitalization rate decreases by two percent  to a three percent market capitalization rate 
for the year ended december   we recognized an impairment loss of  associated with certain land parcels which we no longer intend to develop 
at december  we determined that none of our consolidated operating communities  development communities  or investments in unconsolidated joint ventures were impaired under the provisions of sfas  or apb  as appropriate 
these conclusions were based on the factors that existed as of december  given the recent deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions  we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed  or the likelihood of any future impairment charges  if any 
you should also review item a  risk factors of this form k 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of the code  as amended  for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
for example  if we failed to qualify as a reit in  our net income would have decreased by approximately  our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment 
therefore  we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being interest rate risk 
we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates  primarily associated with short term interest rates such as libor 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness  not for trading or speculative purposes 
under swap agreements we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment  and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of interest rate swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt 
the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate  tax exempt debt was not electively entered into by us but  rather  was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain tax exempt bond financings 
had these swap agreements not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively  based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher throughout and and these swap agreements had not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively 
because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our variable rate credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  fixed rate debt excluding our variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency or equity price risk  and our exposure to commodity price risk is insignificant
