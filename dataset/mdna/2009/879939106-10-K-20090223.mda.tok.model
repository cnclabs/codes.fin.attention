we perform a variety of bpo services for our clients and support approximately unique bpo programs 
we believe bpo is a key enabler of improved business performance as measured by a company s ability to consistently outperform peers through business and economic cycles 
we believe the benefits of bpo include renewed focus on core capabilities  faster time to market  streamlined processes  movement from a fixed to variable cost structure  access to borderless sourcing capabilities  and creation of proprietary best operating practices and technology  all of which contribute to increased customer satisfaction and shareholder returns for our clients 
industry studies indicate that companies with high customer satisfaction levels enjoy premium pricing in their industry  which we believe results in increased profitability and greater shareholder returns 
given the strong correlation between customer satisfaction and improved profitability  more and more companies are increasingly focused on selecting outsourcing partners  such as teletech  that can deliver strategic front and back office capabilities to improve the customer experience rather than simply reducing costs 
our business history we were founded in and reorganized as a delaware corporation in we completed an initial public offering of our common stock in and since that time have grown our annual revenue from million to billion  representing a compounded annual growth rate cagr of 
our revenue is derived from bpo services and is reported in our north american and international bpo segments

many of our clients choose a blended strategy whereby they outsource work with us in multiple geographic locations and may also utilize our work from home offering 
we believe our ability to offer one of the most geographically diverse footprints improves service flexibility while reducing operational and delivery risk in the event of a service interruption at any one location 

table of contents with operations in countries  we believe this makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse providers of bpo services 
we recently expanded into two new emerging markets costa rica and south africa and plan to selectively expand into other attractive delivery markets over time 
of the countries from which we provide bpo services  ten provide services for onshore clients including the us  australia  brazil  china  england  germany  new zealand  northern ireland  scotland and spain 
the other seven countries provide services  partially or entirely  for offshore clients including argentina  canada  costa rica  malaysia  mexico  the philippines and south africa 
the total number of workstations in these countries is  or  of our total delivery capacity 
historical performance as summarized below  following our initial public offering in  we experienced double digit revenue growth through  undertook a business transformation strategy in late and began realizing the benefits of this transformation in and going forward 
beginning in  we were one of the first companies to provide bpo services to us clients from delivery centers in argentina  canada and mexico 
although revenue growth continued at a cagr of from million in to billion in  we experienced net losses during this time period 
we attribute these losses primarily to the global economic downturn  the dot com bubble  the september  terrorist attacks and the business transformation we undertook to further strengthen our industry position and future competitiveness 
the business transformation redefined our delivery model  reduced our cost structure and improved our competitive and financial position by migrating from a decentralized holding company to a centralized operating company to enhance financial and operating disciplines  centralizing our technology infrastructure and migrating to a ip based delivery platform  standardizing our global operational processes and applications  automating and virtualizing our human capital needs primarily around talent acquisition  training and performance optimization  improving the efficiency of certain underperforming operations and reducing our selling  general and administrative expenses  improving pricing or rationalizing the performance of certain underperforming client programs  investing in sales and client account management  investing in innovative new solutions to diversify revenue into higher margin offerings  including professional services  learning services and hosted technology solutions  increasing delivery capabilities with expanded onshore  offshore and work from home solutions  reducing long term debt by nearly million from to with cash surpluses and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and approving and executing a stock repurchase program 
as a result of this business transformation  from to  our revenue grew at a cagr of from billion to billion and diluted earnings per share grew at a cagr of from to 
our operating margin more than doubled to in from in as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and a debt to equity ratio of 
we generated million in free cash flow during and our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility have enabled us to fund million in capital expenditures 
approximately of our capital expenditures were related to growth primarily in 
table of contents offshore markets with the remaining used for the development and maintenance of our embedded infrastructure 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of free cash flow and other non gaap measurements 
our improved revenue and operating margin in resulted from growth with both new and existing clients across an expanding array of industry verticals  increased utilization of our delivery centers across a hour period  leveraging our global purchasing power and continued expansion of services provided from our geographically diverse delivery centers 
in november  the board of directors board authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to million of our common stock with the objective of increasing stockholder returns 
the board has since periodically authorized additional increases in the program 
the most recent board authorization to purchase additional common stock occurred in july  whereby the program allowance was increased by approximately million to million 
since inception of the program through december   the board has authorized the repurchase of shares up to a value of million 
during the year ended december   we purchased million shares for million 
since inception of the program  we have purchased million shares for million 
as of december   remaining allowance under the program was approximately million 
in february  the board authorized an increase of million in the funding available for share repurchases 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
our future growth goals and strategy our business strategy to increase revenue  profitability and our industry position includes the following elements capitalize on the favorable trends in the global outsourcing environment  which we believe will include more companies that want to adopt or increase bpo services  consolidate outsourcing providers with those that have a solid financial position  capital resources to sustain a long term relationship and globally diverse delivery capabilities across a broad range of solutions  modify their approach to outsourcing based on total value delivered versus the lowest priced provider  and better integrate front and back office processes 
deepen and broaden our relationships with existing clients  win business with new clients and focus on targeted industries where we expect accelerating adoption of business process outsourcing  continue to invest in innovative proprietary technology and new business offerings  continue to improve our operating margins through increased asset utilization of our globally diverse delivery centers  scaling our work from home initiative to increase operational flexibility  and selectively pursue acquisitions that extend our capabilities  geographic reach and or industry expertise 
our market opportunity companies around the world are increasingly realizing that the quality of their customer relationships are critical to maintaining their competitive advantage 
this realization has driven companies to increase their focus on developing  managing  growing and continuously enhancing their customer relationships 

table of contents additionally  globalization of the world s economy continues to accelerate 
businesses are now competing on a large scale basis due to rapid advances in technology and telecommunications that permit cost effective real time global communications and ready access to a highly skilled worldwide labor force 
as a result of these developments  companies have increasingly outsourced business processes to third party providers in an effort to enhance or maintain their competitive position while increasing shareholder value through improved productivity and profitability 
we believe that our revenue will continue to grow over the long term as global demand for our services is fueled by the following trends integration of front and back office business processes to provide increased operating efficiencies and an enhanced customer experience especially in light of the weakening global economic environment 
companies have realized that integrated business processes reduce operating costs and allow customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently resulting in higher customer satisfaction and brand loyalty thereby improving their competitive position 
a majority of our historic revenue has been derived from providing customer facing front office solutions to our clients 
given that our global delivery centers are also fully capable of providing back office solutions  we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue by winning more back office opportunities and providing the services during non peak hours with minimal incremental investment 
furthermore  by spreading our fixed costs across a larger revenue base and increasing our asset utilization  we expect our profitability to improve over time 
increasing percentage of company operations being outsourced to most capable third party providers 
having experienced success with outsourcing a portion of their business processes  companies are increasingly inclined to outsource a larger percentage of this work 
we believe companies will continue to consolidate their business processes with third party providers  such as teletech  who are financially stable and able to invest in their business while also demonstrating an extensive global operating history and an ability to cost effectively scale to meet their evolving needs 
increasing adoption of outsourcing across broader groups of industries 
early adopters of the business process outsourcing trend  such as the media and communications industries  are being joined by companies in other industries  including healthcare  retail and financial services 
these companies are beginning to adopt outsourcing to improve their business processes and competitiveness 
for example  we have seen an increase in our revenue from the healthcare  retail and financial services industries 
we believe the number of other industries that will adopt or increase their level of outsourcing will continue to grow further enabling us to increase and diversify our revenue and client base 
focus on speed to market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations 
as companies broaden their product offerings and seek to enter new emerging markets  they are looking for outsourcing providers that can provide speed to market while reducing their capital and operating risk 
to achieve these benefits  companies are seeking bpo providers with an extensive operating history  an established global footprint  the financial strength to invest in innovation to deliver more strategic capabilities and the ability to scale and meet customer demands quickly 
given our financial stability  geographic presence in countries and our significant investment in standardized technology and processes  clients increasingly select teletech because we can quickly ramp large  complex business processes around the globe in a short period of time while assuring a high quality experience for their customers

our competitive strengths entering a business services outsourcing relationship is typically a long term strategic commitment for companies 
the outsourced processes are usually complex and require a high degree of customization and integration with a client s core operations 
accordingly  our clients tend to enter long term contracts which provide us with a more predictable revenue stream 
in addition  we have high levels of client retention due to our operational excellence and ability to meet our clients outsourcing objectives  as well as the significant transition costs required to exit the relationship 
our client retention was in and in we believe that our clients select us due to our industry reputation and our position as one of the largest and most financially sound industry providers with years of expertise in delivering complex bpo solutions across targeted industries  ability to scale infrastructure and employees worldwide using globally deployed best practices to ensure a consistent  high quality service  ability to optimize the performance of our workforce through proprietary hiring  training and performance optimization tools  and commitment to continued product and services innovation to further the strategic capabilities of our clients

this hub and spoke model enables us to provide our services at the lowest cost while increasing scalability  reliability  redundancy  asset utilization and the diversity of our service offerings 
prior to this technology transformation  each of our delivery centers had a significant investment in disparate hardware and software maintained by on site it staff  which was costly to operate and maintain and did not provide the level of reliability or redundancy we now provide 
to ensure high end to end security and reliability of this critical infrastructure  we monitor and manage the teletech gigapops x  days per year from several strategically located state of the art global command centers 
our technology innovations have resulted in the filing of more than intellectual property patent applications 
globally deployed best operating practices globally deployed best operating practices assure that we can deliver a consistent  scalable  high quality experience to our clients customers from any of our delivery centers or work from home associates around the world 
standardized processes include our approach to attracting  screening  hiring  training  scheduling  evaluating  coaching and maximizing associate performance to meet our clients needs

in addition  this information provides valuable insight into what is driving customer inquiries  enabling us to proactively recommend process changes to our clients to optimize their customers experience 
innovative human capital strategies to effectively manage and leverage our human capital requirements  we have developed a proprietary suite of business processes  software tools and client engagement guidelines that work together to improve performance for our clients while enabling us to reduce time to hire  decrease employee turnover and improve time to service and quality of performance

clients in  we had one client that represented more than of our total annual revenue 
sprint nextel represented of total revenue in our top five and ten clients represented and of total revenue in  respectively 
certain of our communications clients  which represent approximately of our total annual revenue  also provide us with telecommunication services through transactions that are negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
we believe each of these supplier contracts is negotiated on an arm s length basis and that the terms are substantially the same as those that have been negotiated with unrelated vendors 
expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than one percent of total costs 
competition we compete with the in house business process operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide bpo services including accenture ltd  convergys corporation  genpact limited  sykes enterprises incorporated and teleperformance  among others 
we work with accenture  computer sciences corporation and ibm on a sub contract basis and approximately of our total revenue is generated from these system integrator relationships 
we compete primarily on the basis of our years of experience  our global locations  our quality and scope of services  our speed and flexibility of implementation  our technological expertise  and our price and contractual terms 
a number of competitors may have different capabilities and resources than ours 
additionally  niche providers or new entrants could capture a segment of the market by developing new systems or services that could impact our market potential 
seasonality historically  we experience a seasonal increase in revenue in the fourth quarter related to higher volumes from clients primarily in the healthcare  package delivery  retail and other industries with seasonal businesses 
also  our operating margins in the first quarter are impacted by higher payroll related taxes with our global workforce 

table of contents employees as of december   we had approximately  employees in countries 
approximately of these employees held full time positions and were located outside of the us we have approximately  employees outside the us and canada covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in most cases  the collective bargaining agreements are mandated under national labor laws 
these collective bargaining agreements include employees in the following countries in argentina  approximately  employees are covered by an industry wide collective bargaining agreement with the confederation of commerce employees that expires annually in march  in brazil  approximately  employees are covered by industry wide collective bargaining agreements with sintratel and sintelmark that expire in may  in mexico  we have approximately  employees covered by an industry wide collective bargaining agreement with the federacion obrero sindicalista that expires in january  in spain  we have approximately  employees covered by industry wide collective bargaining agreements with comfia ccoo and fes ugt that expires in december  and in new zealand  we have approximately employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the engineering printing and manufacturing union that expires in june we anticipate that these agreements will be renewed and that any renewals will not impact us in a manner materially different from all other companies covered by such industry wide agreements 
in australia and the united kingdom  we have approximately employees that have identified themselves as being members of unions  but there is no collective bargaining agreement in place covering these employees 
we believe that our relations with our employees and unions are satisfactory

risk factors in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section  in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks that we face 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline 
risks relating to our business recent changes in us and global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business our business is directly affected by the performance of our clients and general economic conditions 
recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business 
there is evidence that this is affecting demand for some of our services 
in substantially all of our client programs  we generate revenue based  in large part  on the amount of time our employees devote to our clients customers 
consequently  the amount of revenue generated from any particular client program is dependent upon consumers interest in and use of our client s products and or services  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
our clients may not be able to market or develop products and services that require their customers to use our services  especially as a result of the recent downturn in the us and worldwide economy 
furthermore  a decline in our clients business or performance  including possible client bankruptcies  could impair their ability to pay for our services 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our major clients were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay for our services 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause a reduction in our revenue and operating results we rely on strategic  long term relationships with large  global companies in targeted industries 
as a result  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients 
our five largest clients collectively represented of revenue in and of revenue in our ten largest clients represented of revenue in and of revenue in one of our clients  sprint nextel  represented of our revenue in and of our revenue in sprint nextel was the only client that represented over of our revenue during these periods 
we believe that a substantial portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of our clients in the future 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that any contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
the volumes and profit margins of our most significant programs may decline and we may not be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate comparable revenue and profits 
the loss of all or part of a major client s business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
client consolidations could result in a loss of clients or contract concessions that would adversely affect our operating results we serve clients in targeted industries that have historically experienced a significant level of consolidation 
if one of our clients is acquired by another company including another one of our clients  provisions in certain of our contracts allow these clients to cancel or renegotiate their contracts  or to seek contract concessions 
such consolidations may result in the termination or phasing out of an existing client contract  volume discounts and other contract concessions that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation  penalties and cause us to lose clients we are dependent on it networks and systems to process  transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients 
security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we are also required at times to manage  utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or customer data 
as a result  we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect this information  such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information 
if any person  including any of our employees  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer data  whether through systems failure  employee negligence  fraud or misappropriation  could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
similarly  unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients  whether by our employees or third parties  could result in negative publicity  legal liability and damage to our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our financial results depend on our capacity utilization  in particular our ability to forecast our clients customer demand and make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and operating expenses our delivery center utilization rates have a substantial and direct effect on our profitability  and we may not achieve desired utilization rates 
our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to maintain and increase capacity in each of our delivery centers during peak and non peak hours  our ability to predict our clients customer demand for our services and thereby to make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and other operating expenditures in each of our delivery center locations  our ability to hire and assimilate new employees and manage employee turnover  and our need to devote time and resources to training  professional development and other non chargeable activities 
we attempt to maximize utilization 
however  because the majority of our business is inbound from our clients customer initiated encounters  we have significantly higher utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
we have experienced periods of idle capacity  particularly in our multi client delivery centers 
historically  we experience idle peak period capacity upon opening a new delivery center or termination or completion of a large client program 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our delivery centers 
we may consolidate or close under performing delivery centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in the event we close delivery centers in the future  we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain desired delivery center capacity utilization 
as a result of the fixed costs associated with each delivery center  quarterly variations in client volumes  many of which are outside our control  can have a material adverse effect on our utilization rates 
if our utilization rates are below expectations in any given quarter  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for that quarter could be adversely affected 
our business depends on uninterrupted service to clients our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our facilities  computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  terrorist or cyber 
table of contents attacks  sabotage  telecommunications interruption or failure  labor shortages  weather conditions  natural disasters and other similar events 
additionally  severe weather can cause our employees to miss work and interrupt the delivery of our services  resulting in a loss of revenue 
in the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our locations including our corporate headquarters building  our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages or face the suspension or loss of a client s business 
although we maintain property and business interruption insurance  such insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur 
many of our contracts utilize performance pricing that link some of our fees to the attainment of various performance or business targets  which could increase the variability of our revenue and operating margin a majority of our contracts include performance clauses that condition some of our fees on the achievement of agreed upon performance standards or milestones 
these performance standards can be complex and often depend in some measure on our clients actual levels of business activity or other factors outside of our control 
if we fail to satisfy these measures  it could reduce our revenue under the contracts or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms 
our contracts provide for early termination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results most of our contracts do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue and the profitability of each client program may fluctuate  sometimes significantly  throughout the various stages of a program 
our objective is to sign multi year contracts with our clients 
however  our contracts generally enable the clients to terminate the contract or reduce customer interaction volumes 
our larger contracts generally require the client to pay a contractually agreed amount and or provide prior notice in the event of early termination 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect early termination fees 
we may not be able to offset increased costs with increased service fees under long term contracts some of our larger long term contracts allow us to increase our service fees if and to the extent certain cost or price indices increase 
the majority of our expenses are payroll and payroll related  which includes healthcare costs 
over the past several years  payroll costs  including healthcare costs  have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices 
increases in our service fees that are based upon increases in cost or price indices may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover increases in our costs through increased service fees 
our business may be affected by our ability to obtain financing from time to time  we may need to obtain debt or equity financing for capital expenditures  stock repurchases  payment of existing obligations  replenishment of cash reserves  acquisitions or joint ventures 
additionally  our existing credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  or that any such financing would be on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our debt agreements or  in the event of noncompliance  will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from the lenders 
our business may be affected by risks associated with international operations and expansion an important component of our growth strategy is continued international expansion 
there are certain risks inherent with conducting international business  including but not limited to management of personnel overseas  longer payment cycles  
table of contents difficulties in accounts receivable collections  foreign currency exchange rates  difficulties in complying with foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and social instability  as demonstrated by terrorist threats  regime change  increasing tension in the middle east and other regions  and the resulting need for enhanced security measures  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one or more of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our international operations successfully 
our financial results may be impacted by foreign currency exchange risk we serve an increasing number of our clients from delivery centers in other countries that include argentina  canada  costa rica  malaysia  mexico  the philippines and south africa 
contracts with these clients are typically priced  invoiced  and paid in us dollars while the costs incurred to operate these delivery centers are denominated in the functional currency of the applicable non us based operating subsidiary 
therefore  fluctuations between the currencies of the contracting and operating subsidiary present foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and approximately of our revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies  our results of operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
while we enter into forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  the foreign exchange exposure between the contracting and operating subsidiaries is not hedged 
since the operating subsidiary assumes the foreign exchange exposure  its operating margins could decrease if the contracting subsidiary s currency devalues against the operating subsidiary s currency 
for example  our operating subsidiaries are at risk if the us dollar weakens 
if the us dollar devalues  the financial results of certain operating subsidiaries and teletech upon consolidation will be negatively affected 
while our hedging strategy effectively offsets a portion of these foreign currency changes  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully hedge this foreign currency exchange risk or that the value of the us dollar will not materially weaken 
if we fail to manage our foreign currency exchange risk  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements because we provide services to clients in countries  we are subject to numerous  and sometimes conflicting  legal regimes on matters as diverse as import export controls  content requirements  trade restrictions  tariffs  taxation  sanctions  government affairs  immigration  internal and disclosure control obligations  data privacy and labor relations 
violations of these regulations could result in liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution  unfavorable publicity  restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations 
due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate  local laws might be insufficient to protect our contractual and intellectual property rights  among other rights 
changes in us federal  state and international laws and regulations may adversely affect the sale of our services  including expansion of overseas operations 
in the us  some of our services must comply with 
table of contents various federal and state regulations regarding the method of placing outbound telephone calls 
in addition  we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients businesses that are transferred to us 
changes in these regulations and requirements  or new restrictive regulations and requirements  may slow the growth of our services or require us to incur substantial costs 
changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions  such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services  or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions 
these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 
our financial results and projections may be impacted by our ability to maintain and find new locations for our delivery centers in countries with stable wage rates our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
as a result  our future growth is dependent upon our ability to find cost effective locations in which to operate  both domestically and internationally 
some of our delivery centers are located in countries that have experienced rising standards of living  which may in turn require us to increase employee wages 
in addition  approximately  employees outside the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although we anticipate that the terms of agreements will not impact us in a manner materially different than other companies located in these countries  we may not be able to pass increased labor costs on to our clients 
there is no assurance that we will be able to find cost effective locations 
any increases in labor costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the business process outsourcing markets are highly competitive  and we might not be able to compete effectively our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships  maintain and expand existing client programs  staff and equip suitable delivery center facilities in a timely manner  and develop new solutions and enhance existing solutions we provide to our clients 
moreover  we compete with a variety of companies with respect to our offerings  including large multinational providers  including the service arms of large global technology providers  offshore service providers in lower cost locations that offer services similar to those we offer  often at highly competitive prices  niche solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market  industry segment or service area  and most importantly  the in house operations of clients or potential clients 
because our primary competitors are the in house operations of existing or potential clients  our performance and growth could be adversely affected if our existing or potential clients decide to provide in house business process services they currently outsource  or retain or increase their in house business processing services and product support capabilities 
in addition  competitive pressures from current or future competitors also could cause our services to lose market acceptance or put downward pressure on the prices we charge for our services and on our operating margins 
if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

table of contents we may not be able to develop our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand our success depends on our ability to develop and implement systems technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry developments and client needs 
our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop new technologies that expand our existing solutions and offerings  achieve cost efficiencies in our existing delivery center operations  and introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis 
our integration of new technologies may not achieve their intended cost reductions and services and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service offerings uncompetitive or obsolete 
our failure to maintain our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to recruit  hire  train and retain key executives or qualified employees  our business will be adversely affected our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit  train  and retain qualified personnel 
we generally experience high employee turnover and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force 
demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages  including english  and or certain technologies may exceed supply  as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving technologies 
in addition  certain delivery centers are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates  which could make it more costly to hire qualified personnel 
our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting  training  or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our success is also dependent upon the efforts  direction and guidance of our executive management team 
although members of our executive team are subject to non competition agreements  they can terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any member of our senior management team could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and growth potential 
if we fail to integrate businesses and assets that we may acquire through joint ventures or acquisitions  we may lose clients and our liquidity  capital resources and profitability may be adversely affected we may pursue joint ventures or strategic acquisitions of companies with services  technologies  industry specializations  or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business 
acquisitions and joint ventures often involve a number of special risks  including the following we may encounter difficulties integrating acquired software  operations and personnel and our management s attention could be diverted from other business concerns  we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired technology and rights into our service offerings and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the businesses or assets we acquire may fail to achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated  causing us to incur additional debt to fund operations and to write down the value of acquisitions on our financial statements  
table of contents we may assume liabilities associated with the sale of the acquired company s products or services  our resources may be diverted in asserting and defending our legal rights and we may ultimately be liable for contingent and other liabilities  not previously disclosed to us  of the companies that we acquire  acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and dilute our ownership interest  acquisitions may result in litigation from former employees or third parties  and due diligence may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  ownership rights and legal contingencies  among other matters 
we may pursue strategic alliances in the form of joint ventures and partnerships  which involve many of the same risks as acquisitions as well as additional risks associated with possible lack of control if we do not have a majority ownership position 
any of the factors identified above could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  negotiation of potential acquisitions and the resulting integration of acquired businesses  products  or technologies  could divert management s time and resources 
future acquisitions could cause us to issue dilutive equity or incur debt  contingent liabilities  additional amortization charges from intangible assets  asset impairment charges  or write off charges for in process research and development and other indefinite lived intangible assets that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks relating to our common stock the market price for our common stock may be volatile the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other factors  the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results  announcements of new contracts or contract cancellations  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  our ability to meet the expectations of securities analysts  conditions or trends in the business process outsourcing industry  changes in the market valuations of other business process outsourcing companies  developments in countries where we have significant delivery centers  gigapops or operations  the ability of our clients to pay for our services  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq global select market and the market for bpo providers in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary teletech is one of the largest and most geographically diverse global providers of business process outsourcing solutions 
we have a year history of designing  implementing and managing critical business processes for global companies to help them improve their customers experience  expand their strategic capabilities and increase their operating efficiencies 
by delivering a high quality customer experience through the effective integration of customer facing  front office processes with internal back office processes  we enable our clients to better serve  grow and retain their customer base 
we have developed deep vertical industry expertise and support approximately business process outsourcing programs serving global clients in the automotive  broadband  cable  financial services  government  healthcare  logistics  media and entertainment  retail  technology  travel  wireline and wireless communication industries 
as globalization of the world s economy continues to accelerate  businesses are increasingly competing on a large scale basis due to rapid advances in technology and telecommunications that permit cost effective real time global communications and ready access to a highly skilled worldwide labor force 
as a result of these developments  companies have increasingly outsourced business processes to third party providers in an effort to enhance or maintain their competitive position while increasing shareholder value through improved productivity and profitability 
we believe that our revenue will continue to grow over the long term as global demand for our services is fueled by the following trends integration of front and back office business processes to provide increased operating efficiencies and an enhanced customer experience especially in light of the weakening global economic environment 
companies have realized that integrated business processes reduce operating costs and allow customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently resulting in higher customer satisfaction and brand loyalty thereby improving their competitive position 
a majority of our historic revenue has been derived from providing customer facing front office solutions to our clients 
given that our global delivery centers are also fully capable of providing back office solutions  we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue by winning more back office opportunities and providing the services during non peak hours with minimal incremental investment 
furthermore  by spreading our fixed costs across a larger revenue base and increasing our asset utilization  we expect our profitability to improve over time 
increasing percentage of company operations being outsourced to most capable third party providers 
having experienced success with outsourcing a portion of their business processes  
table of contents companies are increasingly inclined to outsource a larger percentage of this work 
we believe companies will continue to consolidate their business processes with third party providers  such as teletech  who are financially stable and able to invest in their business while also demonstrating an extensive global operating history and an ability to cost effectively scale to meet their evolving needs 
increasing adoption of outsourcing across broader groups of industries 
early adopters of the business process outsourcing trend  such as the media and communications industries  are being joined by companies in other industries  including healthcare  retail and financial services 
these companies are beginning to adopt outsourcing to improve their business processes and competitiveness 
for example  we have seen an increase in our revenue from the healthcare  retail and financial services industries 
we believe the number of other industries that will adopt or increase their level of outsourcing will continue to grow further enabling us to increase and diversify our revenue and client base 
focus on speed to market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations 
as companies broaden their product offerings and seek to enter new emerging markets  they are looking for outsourcing providers that can provide speed to market while reducing their capital and operating risk 
to achieve these benefits  companies are seeking bpo providers with an extensive operating history  an established global footprint  the financial strength to invest in innovation to deliver more strategic capabilities and the ability to scale and meet customer demands quickly 
given our financial stability  geographic presence in countries and our significant investment in standardized technology and processes  clients increasingly select teletech because we can quickly ramp large  complex business processes around the globe in a short period of time while assuring a high quality experience for their customers 
our strategy our objective is to become the world s largest  most technologically advanced and innovative provider of onshore  offshore and work from home bpo solutions 
companies within the global are our primary client targets due to their size  global nature  focus on outsourcing and desire for the global  scalable integrated process solutions that we offer 
we have developed  and continue to invest in  a broad set of capabilities designed to serve this growing client need 
these investments include our teletech home offering which allows our employees to serve clients from their home 
this capability has enhanced the flexibility of our offering allowing clients to choose our onshore  offshore or work from home employees to meet their outsourced business process needs 
in addition we have begun to offer hosted services where clients can license any aspect of our global network and proprietary applications 
while the revenue from these offerings is small relative to our consolidated revenue  we believe it will continue to grow as these services become more widely adopted by our clients 
we aim to further improve our competitive position by investing in a growing suite of new and innovative business process services across our targeted industries 
our business strategy to increase revenue  profitability and our industry position includes the following elements deepen and broaden our relationships with existing clients  win business with new clients and focus on targeted industries where we expect accelerating adoption of business process outsourcing  continue to invest in innovative proprietary technology and new business offerings  continue to improve our operating margins through increased asset utilization of our globally diverse delivery centers  and selectively pursue acquisitions that extend our capabilities  geographic reach and or industry expertise

our income from operations grew to million or of revenue in from million or of revenue in income from operations in included million of asset impairment and restructuring charges and million of selling  general and administrative charges associated with our equity based compensation review  financial restatement and related lawsuits 
excluding both of these charges  which totaled million  our income from operations in increased to million or of revenue from million or of revenue in excluding million of charges associated with our equity based compensation review and financial restatement and million of asset impairment and restructuring charges 
our improved revenue and operating margin resulted from growth with both new and existing clients across an expanding array of industry verticals  increased utilization of our delivery centers across a hour period  leveraging our global purchasing power and continued expansion of services from our geographically diverse delivery centers 
we have experienced growth in our offshore delivery centers  which primarily serve clients located in other countries 
our offshore delivery capacity now spans seven countries and  workstations and currently represents of our global delivery capabilities 
revenue in these offshore locations grew in to million and represented of our total revenue 
to meet continued client demand in  we added  gross workstations primarily in offshore locations including the philippines  south africa and latin america 
while historically it was primarily us based clients that were willing to utilize our offshore delivery capabilities  we have increasingly seen clients in europe and asia pacific willing to utilize our offshore delivery capabilities and expect this trend to continue with clients in other countries 
in light of this trend  we plan to continue to selectively expand into new offshore markets 
for example  we believe we are one of the first multi national bpo providers to enter the african continent 
as we grow our offshore delivery capabilities and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations increase  we continue to actively manage this risk via a multi currency hedging program designed to minimize operating margin volatility 
our strong financial position due to our cash flow from operations and low debt levels allowed us to finance a significant portion of our capital needs and stock repurchases through internally generated cash flows

we have committed to make our employees whole for any adverse tax consequences arising as a result of the vesting or exercise of mispriced options identified through the review 
business overview we serve our clients through the primary business of bpo services 
our bpo business provides outsourced business process and customer management services for a variety of industries through global delivery centers 
when we begin operations in a new country  we determine whether the country is intended to primarily serve us based clients  in which case we include the country in our north american 
table of contents bpo segment  or if the country is intended to serve both domestic clients from that country and us based clients  in which case we include the country in our international bpo segment 
this is consistent with our management of the business  internal financial reporting structure and operating focus

bpo services the bpo business generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our associates devote to a client s program 
we primarily focus on large global corporations in the following industries automotive  cable and communications  financial services  healthcare  logistics  media and entertainment  retail  technology  travel and wireline and wireless telecommunications 
revenue is recognized as services are 
table of contents provided 
the majority of our revenue is from multi year contracts and we expect that trend to continue 
however  we do provide certain client programs on a short term basis 
we have historically experienced annual attrition of existing client programs of approximately to of our revenue 
attrition of existing client programs during and was and  respectively 
the bpo industry is highly competitive 
we compete primarily with the in house business processing operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide bpo on an outsourced basis 
our ability to sell our existing services or gain acceptance for new products or services is challenged by the competitive nature of the industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell services to new clients  renew relationships with existing clients  or gain client acceptance of our new products 
we have improved our revenue and profitability in both the north american and the international bpo segments by capitalizing on the favorable trends in the global outsourcing environment  which we believe will include more companies that want to adopt or increase bpo services  consolidate outsourcing providers with those that have a solid financial position  capital resources to sustain a long term relationship and globally diverse delivery capabilities across a broad range of solutions  modify their approach to outsourcing based on total value delivered versus the lowest priced provider  and better integrate front and back office processes 
deepening and broadening relationships with existing clients  winning business with new clients and focusing on targeted high growth industry verticals  continuing to diversify revenue into higher margin offerings such as professional services  talent acquisition  learning services and our hosted teletech ondemand tm capabilities  increasing capacity utilization during peak and non peak hours  scaling our work from home initiative to increase operational flexibility  and completing select acquisitions that extend our core bpo capabilities or vertical expertise 
our ability to renew or enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our clients operate 
a weakening of the us or the global economy could lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our potential clients typically obtain bids from multiple vendors and evaluate many factors in selecting a service provider  including  among other factors  the scope of services offered  the service record of the vendor and price 
we generally price our bids with a long term view of profitability and  accordingly  we consider all of our fixed and variable costs in developing our bids 
we believe that our competitors  at times  may bid business based upon a short term view  as opposed to our longer term view  resulting in a lower price bid 
while we believe our clients perceptions of the value we provide results in our being successful in certain competitive bid situations  there are often situations where a potential client may prefer a lower cost 
our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our delivery centers are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover  and the length of training time required to implement new programs continues to increase due to 
table of contents increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs and need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
as discussed above  to some extent our profitability is influenced by the number of new client programs entered into within the period 
for new programs we defer revenue related to initial training training revenue when training is billed as a separate component from production rates 
consequently  the corresponding training costs associated with this revenue  consisting primarily of labor and related expenses training costs  are also deferred 
in these circumstances  both the training revenue and training costs are amortized straight line over the life of the contract 
in situations where training revenue is not billed separately  but rather included in the production rates  there is no deferral as all revenue is recognized over the life of the contract and the associated training expenses are expensed as incurred 
deferred training revenue increased million in to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
correspondingly  deferred training costs increased million in to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in these deferrals was due to growth in new client programs where training was billed separately during the period 
as of december   we had deferred training revenue  net of deferred training costs  of million that will be recognized into our income from operations over the remaining life of the corresponding contracts approximately months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of deferred training revenue 
we may have difficulties managing the timeliness of launching new or expanded client programs and the associated internal allocation of personnel and resources 
this could cause slower than anticipated revenue growth and or higher than expected costs primarily related to hiring  training and retaining the required workforce  either of which could adversely affect our operating results 
quarterly  we review our capacity utilization and projected demand for future capacity 
in conjunction with these reviews  we may decide to consolidate or close under performing delivery centers  including those impacted by the loss of a major client program  in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in addition  because clients may request that we serve their customers from international delivery centers with lower prevailing labor rates  in the future we may decide to close one or more of our delivery centers  even though it is generating positive cash flow  because we believe the future profits from conducting such work outside the current delivery center may more than compensate for the one time charges related to closing the facility 
our profitability is influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our delivery centers 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new delivery centers or the expansion of existing delivery centers 
as such  management considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations  or expansions of existing programs and the potential size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
as a result  we expanded our capacity in by approximately  gross workstations in primarily offshore locations including the philippines  south africa and latin america 
concurrent with these increases  we also reduced our capacity in by approximately  workstations in north america  asia pacific  spain and mexico as we continue to rationalize our capacity based on client demand 
to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  to implement new programs and to expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute a client contract as we concentrate our marketing efforts toward obtaining large  complex bpo programs 
we internally target capacity utilization in our delivery centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers 
table of contents was and is lower than the prior year due to softness of existing client volumes in light of the weakening economic environment 
the table below presents workstation data for our multi client centers as of december  and dedicated and managed centers  and  workstations  at december  and  respectively are excluded from the workstation data as unused workstations in these facilities are not available for sale 
our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations 
we may change the designation of shared or dedicated centers based on the normal changes in our business environment and client needs

as a result of the transaction which was completed on september   newgen received million in cash and recorded a loss on disposal of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this disposition 
the revenue from this business was generated utilizing a database and contact system to promote the sales and service business of automobile dealership customers using targeted marketing solutions through the phone  mail  email  and the web 
this business generated a loss from operations of approximately million for the year ended december  concurrent with the sale  we entered into an agreement with the buyer of our database marketing and consulting business to provide ongoing bpo services to that segment that were previously being performed by us 
we reviewed the direct cash flows associated with this agreement and compared them to our estimates of the revenue associated with the database marketing and consulting business 
we concluded that these direct cash flows were significant 
as a result  the operations included in the database marketing and consulting business did not meet the criteria under statement of accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas and therefore was not classified as discontinued operations 
prior to the sale and as a result of the business continued losses  during june  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would dispose of our database marketing and consulting business 
this triggered impairment testing on an interim basis for this segment under the guidance of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the database  marketing and consulting business recorded an impairment loss of million during the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of their goodwill to zero 

table of contents on december   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  newgen results corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  filed a voluntary petition for liquidation under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
under accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  a consolidation of a majority owned subsidiary is precluded where control does not rest with the majority owners 
accordingly  the company deconsolidated newgen results corporation as of december  overall as shown in the results of operations section which follows later  we have improved income from operations for our north american and international bpo segments 
the increases are attributable to a variety of factors such as expansion of work on certain client programs  transitioning work on certain client programs to lower cost operating centers  improving individual client program profit margins and or eliminating underperforming programs and our multi phased cost reduction plan 
as we pursue acquisition opportunities  it is possible that the contemplated benefits of any future acquisitions may not materialize within the expected time periods or to the extent anticipated 
critical to the success of our acquisition strategy is the orderly  effective integration of acquired businesses into our organization 
if this integration is unsuccessful  our business may be adversely impacted 
there is also the risk that our valuation assumptions and models for an acquisition may be overly optimistic or incorrect 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition for each client arrangement  we determine whether evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of our service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if all criteria are met  we recognize revenue at the time services are performed 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all of the criteria are met 
our bpo segments recognize revenue under three models production rate revenue is recognized based on the billable time or transactions of each associate  as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable time or transaction is based on a pre determined contractual rate 
this contractual rate can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality and performance 
performance based under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our clients based on the achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual results against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
amounts collected from clients prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded in other short term liabilities or other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents hybrid hybrid models include production rate and performance based elements 
for these types of arrangements  we allocate revenue to the elements based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue for each element is recognized based on the methods described above 
certain client programs provide for adjustments to monthly billings based upon whether we meet or exceed certain performance criteria as set forth in the contract 
increases or decreases to monthly billings arising from such contract terms are reflected in revenue as earned or incurred 
periodically we make certain expenditures related to acquiring contracts  or providing up front discounts for future services to existing customers recorded as contract acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
those expenditures are capitalized and amortized in proportion to the expected future revenue from the contract  which in most cases results in straight line amortization over the life of the contract 
amortization of these amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
as required by sfas  we continually review the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future tax periods under the more likely than not criteria 
in making this judgment  sfas requires that all available evidence  both positive and negative  should be considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
the financial accounting standards board recently issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas fin was effective for our year 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  and settlement of issues under audit 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact fin has had on our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter  management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management s judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment include  among other things  the age of the identified receivable  client financial condition  previous client payment history and any recent communications with the client 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carry amount may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas an asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash 
table of contents flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates 
goodwill we assess the realizability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it may be impaired 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we aggregate segment components with similar economic characteristics in forming a reporting unit  aggregation can be based on types of customers  methods of distribution of services  shared operations  acquisition history  and management judgment and reporting 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units 
the most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services  projected labor costs  as well as contract negotiation status 
the projected revenue average growth rates of our reporting units ranged from a revenue decline of to a revenue growth of per annum over a three year period 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
we use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
based on the analyses performed in the fourth quarter of  there was no impairment to the december  goodwill balances of our reporting units 
if actual results are less than the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred 
however  a decrease of in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at december  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
restructuring liability we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our delivery centers and existing markets 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing delivery centers and complete reductions in workforce to enhance future profitability 
we follow sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than upon commitment to a plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing delivery centers is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the facility 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a reversal of previously reported losses 
adoption of sfas no 
r and equity based compensation expense during the first quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
r accounting for share based payment sfas r applying the modified prospective method 
sfas r requires all equity based payments to employees to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the grant date fair value of the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for equity based awards under the intrinsic value method  which followed recognition and measurement principles of apb and related interpretations  and equity based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure within the notes to the financial statements 
we did not modify the terms of any previously granted options in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents in accordance with sfas r  we are required to estimate a forfeiture rate related to pre vested equity awards based on historical forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense is adjusted once an equity award cancels or vests  which could result in a difference from what was originally recorded 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more discussion on equity based accounting 
fair value measurement effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas  which provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap 
as defined in sfas  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
the company utilizes market data or assumptions that the company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about counter party credit risk  including the ability of each party to execute its obligation under the contract  and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
the company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavors to utilize the best available information 
accordingly  the company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by sfas are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange traded derivatives  listed equities and us government treasury securities 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors  and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
instruments in this category include non exchange traded derivatives such as over the counter forwards  options and repurchase agreements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
level instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs 
at each balance sheet date  the company performs an analysis of all instruments subject to sfas and includes in level all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs 
derivatives we account for financial derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate 
table of contents fluctuations that are associated with forecasted revenue in non functional currencies 
upon proper qualification  these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges  as defined by sfas we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our net investment in a foreign operation 
all derivative financial instruments are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  to the extent they are deemed effective 
based on the criteria established by sfas  all of our cash flow hedge contracts are deemed to be highly effective 
changes in fair value of our net investment hedge is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of our net investment in the foreign operation 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within revenue 
gains and losses from the settlements of our net investment hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until partial or complete liquidation of the applicable net investment 
we also enter into fair value derivative contracts that hedge against translation gains and losses 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged  with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized in earnings 
while we expect that our derivative instruments will continue to be highly effective and in compliance with applicable guidance under sfas  as amended  if our hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we determine that forecasted transactions will not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected currently in earnings 
in addition to hedging activities  we also have embedded derivatives in certain foreign lease contracts 
we bifurcate the embedded derivative feature from the host contract in accordance with sfas  with any changes in fair value of the embedded derivatives recognized in cost of services 
contingencies we record a liability in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  management  reviews all litigation and claims on a case by case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss 
explanation of key metrics and other items cost of services cost of services principally includes costs incurred in connection with our bpo operations and database marketing services  including direct labor  telecommunications  printing  postage  sales and use tax and certain fixed costs associated with delivery centers 
in addition  cost of services includes income related to grants we may receive from local or state governments as an incentive to locate delivery centers in their jurisdictions which reduce the cost of services for those facilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with administrative services such as sales  marketing  product development  legal settlements  legal  information systems including core technology and telephony infrastructure and accounting and finance 
it also includes equity based compensation expense  outside professional fees ie legal and accounting services  building expense for non delivery center facilities and other items associated with general business administration 

table of contents restructuring charges  net restructuring charges  net primarily include costs incurred in conjunction with reductions in force or decisions to exit facilities  including termination benefits and lease liabilities  net of expected sublease rentals 
interest expense interest expense includes interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our debts and capitalized lease obligations 
other income the main components of other income are miscellaneous receipts not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction gains and income from the sale of a software and intellectual property license agreement 
other expenses the main components of other expenses are expenditures not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction losses and corporate legal settlements 
presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for income from operations  net income  net cash provided by operating activities  or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful  in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also excludes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions  investments and other needs that may arise 
the following table reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities for our consolidated results amounts in thousands year ended december  free cash flow purchases of property  plant and equipment net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  plant and equipment in are net of proceeds from a government grant of  we discuss factors affecting free cash flow between periods in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
non gaap income from operations we discuss our income from operations for the years ended december  and excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges  and costs associated with our equity based compensation review and financial restatement  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this measure provides meaningful supplemental information by indentifying matters that are not indicative of core business operating results or are of a substantially non recurring nature

management believes that it is helpful to exclude these effects to better understand and analyze the periods effective tax rate given the discrete nature of these items

the effective tax rate for is lower than expected due to the second quarter impairment and third quarter restructuring and loss on the sale of subsidiary recorded for our database marketing and consulting business as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges were all recorded in the us tax jurisdiction and reduced income before taxes recorded in the us and thereby increased the proportion of income before taxes earned in international tax jurisdictions 
finally  we realized a million benefit related to a permanent difference in calculating the gain from disposition of our india joint venture in the fourth quarter as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and a million benefit related to certain tax planning and corporate restructuring activities and the reversal of million in deferred tax valuation allowance recorded against tax assets in prior years

in addition  we recorded new deferred tax assets of million due to a corporate restructuring

our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
further  income taxes are subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions  in which we operate  as well as the requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
in future years  our effective tax rate is expected to return to approximately to  principally because we expect our distribution of pre tax income between the us and our international tax jurisdictions to return to more typical levels seen in recent years 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations  our cash and cash equivalents  and borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement  dated september  the credit facility 
during the year ended december   we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  existing cash and cash 
table of contents equivalents  and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we manage a centralized global treasury function in the united states with a particular focus on concentrating and safeguarding our global cash and cash equivalent reserves 
while we generally prefer to hold us dollars  we maintain adequate cash in the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries to support local operating costs 
while there are no assurances  we believe our global cash is protected given our cash management practices  banking partners  and low risk investments 
we primarily utilize our credit facility to fund working capital  stock repurchases  and other strategic and general operating purposes 
in september  we exercised the upsizing feature under the credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional million  which increased the total commitments to million 
as of december  and december   we had million and million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  respectively 
after consideration for issued letters of credit under the credit facility  totaling million  our remaining borrowing capacity was million as of december  we continue to closely monitor the credit crisis and evaluate how recent events are impacting the liquidity and capitalization of our investment grade rated syndication of banks 
we do not foresee an issue that would limit our access to borrowings under the credit facility 
the amount of capital required over the next months will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain  upgrade or replace existing assets 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures  among other factors 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to us 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december   and cash and cash equivalents we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their original maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities we reinvest our cash flows from operating activities in our business or in the purchase of our outstanding stock 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million  respectively

obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands less than to to over year years years years total credit facility capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating lease commitments total includes estimated interest payments based on the weighted average interest rate and debt outstanding as of december  contractual obligations to be paid in a foreign currency are translated at the period end exchange rate 
purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding purchase orders for goods or services not yet received  which are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets until such goods and or services are received 
the contractual obligation table excludes our fin liabilities of million because we cannot reliably estimate the timing of cash payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
purchase obligations occasionally we contract with certain of our communications clients which currently represent approximately of our annual revenue to provide us with telecommunication services 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arm s length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements we expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately of the expected capital expenditures in are related to the opening and or expansion of delivery centers and relates to the maintenance capital required for existing assets and internal technology projects 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional delivery center capacity as well as enhancements to our technological infrastructure 
we also expect to continue to incur outside legal  accounting and consulting expenses in conjunction with the shareholder class action and derivative action lawsuits filed against us and certain current directors 
table of contents and officers as a result of our review of historical equity based accounting practices 
although we cannot predict the amount of such expenses in  we incurred million and million of expenses in and  respectively  for accounting  legal  tax  other professional services and additional compensation in connection with the audit committee s review as well as restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
we may consider restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures or the incurrence  assumption  or refinancing of indebtedness and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of our operations 
the launch of large client contracts may result in short term negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants our credit facility  dated september   permits us to borrow up to a maximum of million 
the credit facility expires on september  and allows us to request a one year extension beyond the maturity date subject to unanimous approval by the lenders 
the credit facility is secured by the majority of our domestic accounts receivable and a pledge of of the capital stock of specified material foreign subsidiaries 
our domestic subsidiaries are guarantors under the credit facility 
the credit facility  which includes customary financial covenants  may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  purchases of treasury stock and acquisition financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
the credit facility accrues interest at a rate based on either prime rate  defined as the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or libor plus an applicable credit spread  at our option 
the interest rate will vary based on our leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
as of december   interest accrued at the weighted average rate of approximately in addition  we pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the credit facility at a rate of per annum 
as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of million and million  respectively 
our borrowing capacity is reduced by million as a result of the letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
the unused commitment under the credit facility was million as of december  client concentration our five largest clients accounted for  and of our annual revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  these five clients accounted for an even greater proportional share of our consolidated earnings 
the profitability of services provided to these clients varies greatly based upon the specific contract terms with any particular client 
in addition  clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis 
we believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party  this risk is mitigated  in part  by the service level disruptions that would arise for our clients 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and a particular client may have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
market risk also includes credit and non performance risk by counterparties to our various financial instruments  our banking partners 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar  as well as changes in the financial stability of our various counterparty banks 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as discussed below  we enter into derivative instruments to manage and reduce the impact of currency exchange rate changes  primarily between the us dollar canadian dollar  the us dollar philippine peso  the us dollar mexican peso  the us dollar argentine peso  the us dollar s 
african rand  and the u 
s dollar brazilian real 
in order to mitigate against credit and non performance risk  it is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts and other financial instruments with investment grade counterparty financial institutions and  correspondingly  our derivative valuations reflect the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced  nor do we anticipate  any issues related to derivative counterparty defaults 
interest rate risk the interest rate on our credit facility is variable based upon the prime rate and the london interbank offered rate libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there was an million outstanding balance under the credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 
if the prime rate or libor increased basis points  there would not be a material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency risk in addition to the us  we have operations in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  costa rica  england  germany  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  northern ireland  the philippines  scotland  south africa  and spain 
for the years ended december   and  revenue associated with operations in non us countries represented   and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
the expenses from these foreign operations  are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates between local currencies and contractual currencies primarily the us dollar 
as a result  we may experience foreign currency gains or losses  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries 
the majority of this exposure is related to work performed from delivery centers located in canada  the philippines  argentina  and mexico 
in order to mitigate the risk of these foreign currencies from strengthening against the functional currency of the contracting subsidiary  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though not  of the foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall strengthening of the foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the contracting subsidiary over the long term

us dollar n a cash flow hedging program our subsidiaries in argentina  canada  costa rica  the united kingdom  mexico  the philippines and south africa use the local currency as their functional currency for paying labor and other operating costs 
conversely  revenue for these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in us dollars and other foreign currencies 
to hedge against the risk of principally a weaker us dollar  we purchase forward  non deliverable forward and or option contracts to acquire the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future 
we have designated and account for these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  forecasted revenue in non functional currencies  as defined by sfas while we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions  as this is part of transacting business in an international environment 
not every exposure is or can be hedged and  where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure  they are based on forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate 
failure to successfully hedge or anticipate currency risks properly could adversely affect our consolidated operating results 
our cash flow hedging instruments as of december  and are summarized as follows amounts in thousands 
all hedging instruments are forward contracts  except as noted

african rand british pound sterling the portfolio is valued using models based on market observable inputs  including both forward and spot foreign exchange rates  implied volatility  and counterparty credit risk 
the year over year change in fair value largely reflects the recent global economic conditions which resulted in high foreign exchange volatility and an overall strengthening in the us dollar 
we recorded net gains of million  million  and million for settled cash flow hedge contracts and the related premiums for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these gains are reflected in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
if the exchange rates between our various currency pairs were to increase or decrease by from current period end levels  we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains or losses in our underlying exposures 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency while some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
approximately of revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies  thus our results from operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we endeavor to settle these accounts on a timely basis
