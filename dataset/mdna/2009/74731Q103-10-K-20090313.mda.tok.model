item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an investment management firm that utilizes a classic value investment approach in each of our investment strategies 
we currently manage assets in a variety of value oriented investment strategies across a wide range of market capitalizations in both u 
s 
and international capital markets 
at december   our assets under management  or aum  were billion 
we manage separate accounts on behalf of institutions and high net worth individuals and act as sub investment adviser for a variety of sec registered mutual funds and offshore funds 
we function as the holding company through which the business of our operating company  pzena investment management  llc  is conducted 
following our initial public offering and reorganization on october   we became the sole managing member of pzena investment management  llc 
as such  we now control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and other investors collective membership interest in our operating company  we reflect their ownership as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  subsequent to october   our income is generated by our economic interest in our operating company s net income 
results for the periods prior to october  reflect solely the operations of pzena investment management  llc 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of the operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of the business 
revenue we generate revenue from management fees and incentive fees  which we collectively refer to as our advisory fees  by managing assets on behalf of separate accounts and acting as a sub investment adviser for mutual funds and certain other investment funds 
our advisory fee income is recognized over the period in which investment management services are provided 
pursuant to the preferred accounting method under emerging issues task force issue d  accounting for management fees based on a formula eitf d  income from incentive fees is recorded at the conclusion of the contractual performance period  when all contingencies are resolved 
our advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of our aum 
our aum increases or decreases with the net inflows or outflows of funds into our various investment strategies and with the investment performance thereof 
in order to increase our aum and expand our business  we must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients and provide attractive returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our aum  and our ability to continue to attract clients  will depend on a variety of factors includindg  among other things our ability to educate our target clients about our classic value investment strategies and provide them with exceptional client service  the relative investment performance of our investment strategies  as compared to competing products and market indices  competitive conditions in the investment management and broader financial services sectors  general economic conditions  investor sentiment and confidence  and our decision to close strategies when we deem it to be in the best interests of our clients 
for our separately managed accounts  we are paid fees according to a schedule  which varies by investment strategy 
the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases  subject to a minimum fee to manage each account 
certain of these clients pay us fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreed upon benchmarks  which results in a slightly lower base fee  but allow us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreed upon benchmark 
pursuant to our sub investment advisory agreements  we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule  in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of these funds pay us fixed rate management fees 
due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts  the average advisory fees we earn on them  as a percentage of aum  are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our separately managed accounts 
the majority of advisory fees we earn on separately managed accounts are based on the value of aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis  either in arrears or advance 
advisory fees on certain of our separately managed accounts  and with respect to most of the mutual funds that we sub advise  are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value 
advisory fees are also adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio  where the cash flow represents greater than of the value of the portfolio 
while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate  the method used to calculate the fee according to the fee rate schedule may differ as described above 
our advisory fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following changes in aum due to appreciation or depreciation of our investment portfolios  and the levels of the contribution and withdrawal of assets by new and existing clients  distribution of aum among our investment strategies  which have different fee schedules  distribution of aum between separately managed accounts and sub advised funds  for which we generally earn lower overall advisory fees  and the level of our performance with respect to accounts on which we are paid incentive fees 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expenses  as well as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  awards of equity to our employees and members of our operating company  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  and expenses  such as rent  professional service fees and data related costs  incurred  as necessary  to run our business 
compensation and benefits expense our largest expense is compensation and benefits  which includes the salaries  bonuses  equity based compensation and related benefits and payroll costs attributable to our members and employees 
compensation and benefits packages are benchmarked against relevant industry and geographic peer groups in order to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we have experienced a decrease in cash compensation and benefits expense  particularly in  as we reduced our year end bonus packages to reflect the adverse economic conditions in our business and industry in general 
cash compensation has also declined due to lower revenue based variable compensation costs and a decline in headcount 
the table included in the section below describes the components of our compensation expense for the three years ended december  for the year ended december  in thousands cash compensation and other benefits distributions on compensatory units change in redemption value of compensatory units change from formula to fair value plan for compensatory units acceleration of vesting of compensatory units other non cash compensation total compensation and benefits expense historically  we granted profits only interests in our operating company to selected employees 
these profits only interests entitled the holder to a share of the future distributions of our operating company 
pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement of our operating company prior to december   the holders of these profits only interests had the right to require us to redeem their profits only interests upon their termination of employment  or death  at a formula value equal to their pro rata share of our net investment advisory fee revenues for the four completed fiscal quarters preceding their termination  or death  as applicable 
we have accounted for the distributions on profits only interests  as well as the annual increase in their redemption value  in our operating company s financial statements as compensation expense 
on december   all then outstanding profits only interests in our operating company were exchanged for capital units  as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report  and our operating company s operating agreement was amended to  among other things  change the formula pursuant to which it would be required to redeem the previously granted profits only interests  subsequently exchange for capital units  to one based on the fair market value of our firm 
the change in the redemption value required us to a take a one time compensation charge of million in the fourth quarter of  which was recorded as compensation expense  with respect to the capital units deemed compensatory 
our operating company s operating agreement was further amended as of march  to eliminate its obligation to redeem units under any circumstance 
as all of its membership units thereafter had only equity characteristics  neither distributions nor subsequent incremental changes to their value were charged against income from the date of the amendment 
as of march   we accelerated the vesting of all compensatory units  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report  then subject to vesting 
the one time charge associated with this acceleration  approximately million  was recorded on march  subsequent to this date  distributions on these units are not considered a component of compensation and benefits expense and are instead recorded as a direct reduction of operating company capital 
on january   we adopted the pim llc equity incentive plan  pursuant to which we have issued restricted units  and options to acquire units  in our operating company  both of which vest ratably over a four year period 
we used a fair value method in recording the compensation expense associated with the granting of these restricted units  and options to acquire units  to new and existing members under the pim llc equity incentive plan 
under this method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the award s vesting period 
the fair value of the units is to be determined by reference to the market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant  since these units are exchangeable for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the fair value of the options to acquire units will be determined by using an appropriate option pricing model on the grant date 
on january   we instituted a deferred compensation plan  in which employees who earn in excess of  per year are required to defer a portion of their compensation in excess of this amount 
these deferred amounts may be invested  at the employee s discretion  in certain of our investment strategies  restricted phantom units of our operating company  or money market funds 
amounts deferred in any calendar year reduce that year s cash compensation expense and vest ratably over a four year period beginning on january of the next year 
therefore  the amortization of deferred amounts has been reflected in our expenses for the year ended december  no material amounts were deferred in should additional amounts be deferred in future years  we would expect the non cash portion of our compensation expense to increase as the existing and subsequently deferred amounts are amortized through income 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrecorded compensation expense related to phantom operating company units issued pursuant to our deferred compensation plan and operating company unit and option grants issued under our pim llc equity incentive plan 
we expect that the amortization of these amounts will be approximately million for each of the next three years  with a negligible amount amortized thereafter 
there was no such unrecorded compensation expense for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include professional and outside services fees  office expenses  depreciation and the costs associated with operating and maintaining our research  trading and portfolio accounting systems 
our occupancy related costs and professional services expenses  in particular  generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the overall size and scale of our business operations 
as a result of our offering on october   we have incurred and expect to incur  additional expenses associated with being a public company for  among other things  director and officer insurance  director fees  sec reporting and compliance including sarbanes oxley compliance  transfer agent fees  professional fees and other similar expenses 
these additional expenses have and will reduce our net income 
other income expense other income expense is derived primarily from interest income generated on our excess cash balances  investment income or loss arising from our investments in various private investment vehicles that we employ to incubate new strategies  interest expense on our amended credit agreement and senior subordinated notes  and mark to market movements on our swap agreement 
other income expense is also affected by changes in our estimates of the liability due to our selling shareholders associated with payments owed to them under the tax receivable agreement which was implemented subsequent to our reorganization and offering on october  as discussed further below  this liability represents of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the amortization of the increases in tax basis generated from company s purchase of operating company units from its selling shareholders 
amounts waived by our selling shareholders reduce this liability 
we expect the interest and investment components of other income  in the aggregate  to fluctuate based on market conditions and the performance of our investment strategies 
non controlling interests our operating company has historically consolidated the results of operations of the private investment partnerships over which we exercise a controlling influence 
after our reorganization  we became the sole managing member of our operating company and now control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and outside investors interest in our operating company  we have reflected their membership interests as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  subsequent to october   our income is generated by our economic interest in our operating company s net income 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of the operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of the business 
provision for income tax while our operating company has historically not been subject to us federal and certain state income taxes  it has been subject to new york city unincorporated business tax 
as a result of our reorganization  we are now subject to taxes applicable to c corporations 
as such  our effective tax rate has increased as a result of our reorganization 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
as discussed below  in  we recorded a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company units in conjunction with the offering 
interest on mandatorily redeemable units until the amendment of its operating agreement on march   the operating company recorded a net liability for its capital units equal to the accumulated redemption value as of the balance sheet date of all such outstanding units 
this liability also included any undistributed earnings attributable to such units 
as such  interest on mandatorily redeemable units included distributions made on capital units outstanding  as well as the incremental increases or decreases in the redemption values of these units 
distributions were generally paid on the operating company s income before non cash compensation charges 
redemption values were determined based on fair value 
prior to march   capital units were required to be redeemed on the death of a member 
effective march   the operating company s operating agreement was amended to eliminate its obligation to redeem units under any circumstance 
since all capital units thereafter had only equity characteristics  neither distributions  nor subsequent incremental changes to these units value  were charged against income subsequent to the effective date of the amendment 
the million charge recorded in represents the distributions and incremental changes to these units fair value through march  operating results general our earnings and cash flows are heavily dependent upon prevailing financial market conditions 
significant increases or decreases in the various securities markets  particularly the equities markets  can have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
beginning in the second half of and continuing through  performance of our investment strategies was negatively impacted by significant volatility in the equity markets  and our overweight investment exposure to the financial services sector in particular 
as a result  our assets under management declined in by billion  or from billion to billion  and billion  or  from billion to billion in  due primarily to negative performance of billion and billion  respectively 
in  we experienced gross outflows of billion  which were partially offset by gross inflows of billion 
our sub advised accounts experienced gross outflows of billion  which were offset by billion in gross inflows 
the billion in net outflows were mainly attributable to the weaker performance of our sub advised funds compared to that of their peers 
our separately managed accounts similarly experienced billion in net outflows during for the year  our separately managed accounts had billion in gross outflows and billion in gross inflows 
in  we experienced gross outflows of billion  which were almost entirely offset by gross inflows of billion 
this decline in aum occurred during the second half of the year 
our sub advised accounts experienced billion in gross outflows of aum  which were offset by billion in gross inflows 
as noted above  the billion in net outflows were mainly attributable to the weaker performance of our sub advised funds compared to that of their peers 
these net outflows were  however  mostly offset by net inflows of billion in our separately managed accounts during for the year  our separately managed accounts experienced gross inflows of billion and gross outflows of billion 
prior to  our aum had grown significantly as a result of several factors including  among others  the exceptional investment performance for the since inception  five year and three year periods for each of our investment strategies through the end of our average aum fluctuates based on changes in the market value of accounts advised and sub advised by us and on fund flows 
accordingly  our revenues have declined from the comparable and periods to the extent that the markets have continued to be unfavorable to our value investment strategy 
a decrease in revenue results in lower operating income and net income 
we expect that we will experience continued pressure on our operating margins in the future if aum continues to decline 
we expect our operating expenses  exclusive of unit based compensation charges  to decline modestly in from the comparable periods  as we identify and implement potential cost savings opportunities 
assets under management and flows the change in aum in our separately managed accounts and our sub advised accounts for the two years ended december  and is described below year ended december  assets under management in billions separately managed accounts beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows performance end of period assets sub advised accounts beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows performance end of period assets total beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows performance end of period assets at december   our billion of aum were invested in twelve value oriented investment strategies which represent distinct capitalization segments of the u 
s and international markets 
the following table describes the allocation of our aum as of december  among our seven largest investment strategies and the aggregate of our other investment strategies investment strategy aum at december  in billions large cap value value service global value small cap value international value mid cap value all cap value other strategies total our five other investment strategies are financial opportunities service  diversified value  european value  mega cap value  and international diversified value 
year ended december  versus december  at december   the company managed billion in total assets  a decrease of billion  or  from billion at december  the decrease year over year in aum was due primarily to billion in market depreciation  and  to a lesser extent  net outflows of billion 
generally negative economic conditions and our overweight investment exposure to the financial services sector in particular contributed to the performance related decline in our aum 
our separately managed and sub advised accounts experienced net outflows of billion and billion  respectively  for the year ended december  these net outflows were driven in part by our investment strategies underperformance relative to their respective benchmarks and client asset re balancing in response to the volatile economic environment 
the company managed billion in separately managed accounts and billion in sub advised accounts  for a total of billion in assets at december  assets in separately managed accounts decreased by billion  or  during the year ended december   due to billion in market depreciation and billion in gross outflows  offset by billion in gross inflows 
assets in sub advised funds decreased by billion  or  during the year ended december   as a result of billion in market depreciation and billion in gross outflows  offset by billion in gross inflows 
at december   separately managed accounts represented of our total aum  as compared to at december  aum in our international value and global value strategies  decreased by a total of billion  or  to billion  at december  from billion at december  at december   our international value and global value investment strategies accounted for of our aum  as compared to at december  year ended december  versus december  at december   the company managed billion in total assets  a decrease of billion  or  from billion at december  the decrease year over year in assets under management was due almost entirely to billion in market depreciation  with net inflows of billion into our separately managed accounts largely offsetting net outflows of billion from our sub advised accounts 
the performance related decline in our aum occurred primarily in the second half of  as market conditions in general deteriorated and were particularly unfavorable to certain of our strategies overweight positions in the financial services sector 
the company managed billion in separately managed accounts and billion in sub advised accounts  for a total of billion in assets at december  assets in separately managed accounts decreased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   due to billion in market depreciation and billion in gross outflows  offset by gross inflows of billion 
during the same period  assets in sub advised accounts decreased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   due to billion in market depreciation and gross outflows of billion  offset by gross inflows of billion 
at december   separately managed accounts represented of our total aum  as compared to at december  aum in our international value and global value strategies  increased by a total of billion  or  to billion  at december  from billion at december  at december   our international value and global value investment strategies accounted for of our aum  as compared to at december  in  we re opened all of our domestic strategies 
revenues our revenues from advisory fees earned on our separately managed accounts and our sub advised accounts for the three years ended december   and is described below year ended december  revenue in millions separately managed accounts sub advised accounts total year ended december  versus december  our total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this change was driven primarily by a reduction in weighted average aum  which decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion from the year ended december  our weighted average fees were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in weighted average fees was primarily due to a shift in asset mix towards separately managed accounts 
weighted average assets in separately managed accounts decreased billion  or  to billion  for the year ended december  from billion at december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
weighted average assets in sub advised accounts decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
years ended december  versus december  our total revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this change was driven primarily by an increase in weighted average aum  which increased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  our weighted average fee was for each of the years ended december  and weighted average assets in separately managed accounts increased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  weighted average fees for separately managed accounts remained constant at for the years ended december  and weighted average assets in sub advised accounts increased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenses our operating expenses are driven primarily by our compensation costs 
the table below describes the components of our compensation expense for the three years ended december    and much of the historical variability in our compensation costs had been driven by distributions made on our compensatory units then outstanding  and the incremental increases or decreases in their redemption value subsequent to their grant date 
as of march   these items are no longer reflected in compensation expense 
for the year ended december  in thousands cash compensation and other benefits distributions on compensatory units change in redemption value of compensatory units change from formula to fair value plan for compensatory units acceleration of vesting of compensatory units other non cash compensation total compensation and benefits expense year ended december  versus december  total operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the million in charges taken in associated with the distributions on  and change in redemption value of  the compensatory units of our operating company and the one time charge associated with the acceleration  as of march   of the vesting of all such compensatory units then subject to vesting 
as a result of changes to the operating company s operating agreement on march   these charges did not recur in compensation and benefits expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the million in charges described above that were not replicated in compensation and benefits expense also decreased due to a million reduction in cash compensation  as we lowered our headcount and reduced our year end bonus packages to reflect the adverse economic conditions in our business and industry in general 
these decreases were  to a limited extent  offset by a million increase in other non cash compensation associated with annual option awards to our employees 
our employee count decreased from at december  to at december  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was mainly attributable to the incurrence  in  of million in professional and outside services fees associated with our reorganization and initial public offering and data system enhancements that were not replicated in these decreases were offset modestly by an increase in facility related costs associated with the full year impact of the lease of additional office space that began in year ended december  versus december  total operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the one time  million compensation charge taken on december  arising as a result of the change in the method of calculating the redemption value of profits only interests in our operating company from a formula based amount to a fair value based amount pursuant to an amendment and restatement of the operating agreement of our operating company on december  the decrease arising from this charge was partially offset in by a million one time charge associated with the acceleration  as of march   of the vesting of all compensatory units of our operating company then subject to vesting 
compensation and benefits expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the million net difference in the one time charges described above of million and million taken in and  respectively 
compensation and benefits expense also decreased as a result of a million decrease in the expense associated with the change in the redemption value of compensatory membership units outstanding  and a million decrease in the compensatory distributions made to employees with respect to these units in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was offset by a million increase in other non cash compensation associated with the vesting of all options granted in  as well as cash costs associated with the hiring of additional employees across all functional areas of the company during the year ended december  overall cash compensation expenses fell slightly in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in part due to the approximately million effect of the initial adoption on january  of the mandatory deferral provisions of the operating company s bonus plan 
our employee count increased from at december  to at december  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly attributable to a million increase in professional and outside services fees associated with our reorganization and initial public offering  and a million increase associated with more significant expenditures for information systems upgrades and data system enhancements commensurate with our growth 
general office and facility related expenses also increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in headcount and the lease of additional office space in other income expense year ended december  versus december  other income expense was income of million for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of in income associated with the reduction in the liability to selling shareholders that occurred in conjunction with the tax valuation allowance taken on september  the company also recognized approximately million in income in the year ended december  related to the waiver  by its selling shareholders  of all payments due to them under the tax receivable agreement for the and tax years 
as discussed further below  this liability represents of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the amortization of the increases in tax basis generated from the company s purchase of operating company units from its selling shareholders 
amounts waived by our selling shareholders reduce this liability 
this income was partially offset by million in losses related to the negative performance of our investments in our own products and million in interest charges associated with the operating company s term loan and subordinated notes agreements 
other income expense was an expense of million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of million in expenses associated with losses related to the negative performance of our investments in our own products and million in interest expense  offset by million in interest  dividend and other income 
year ended december  versus december  other income expense was an expense of million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of million in losses related to the negative performance of our investments and million in interest expense associated with the term loan agreement 
these expenses were partially offset by million in interest  dividend and other income 
other income expense was income of million for the year ended december  and consisted of million of income related to the positive performance of our investment in our own products and million from net interest  dividend income  equity in earnings of affiliates  and other income 
provision for income taxes year ended december  versus december  the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due to the establishment  in the third quarter  of a million valuation allowance assessed against the deferred tax asset recorded as part of our initial public offering 
a comparison of the effective tax rate for the year ended december  to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is not meaningful due to the valuation allowance and the full year effect of our liability for c corporation taxation in year ended december  versus december  the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to an increase in taxable income  as well as the partial year effect of our obligation to pay taxes applicable to c corporations subsequent to the reorganization and our initial public offering 
our effective corporate tax rate for the year ended december   exclusive of our pro rata share of our operating company s provision for the new york city unincorporated business tax  was approximately 
a comparison of the effective tax rate for the year ended december  to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is not meaningful due to the partial year effect of our liability for c corporation taxation  and the equity based compensation charges of million and million taken in and  respectively 
neither of these charges was deductible for tax purposes 
non controlling interests year ended december  versus december  non controlling interests were a charge of million for the year ended december  and consisted of million associated with our employees and outside investors full year interest in the income of the operating company  offset by the million effect of the absorption  by our consolidated subsidiaries  of their share of the losses of our consolidated investment partnerships 
for the year ended december   non controlling interests were a credit of million and consisted primarily of our employees and outside investors exclusive interest in the million loss of our operating company prior to the consummation of our reorganization on october   partially offset by their million interest in the income of the operating company subsequent to that date 
the change in non controlling interests reflects primarily the losses incurred at the operating company in that were not replicated in this change also reflects  to a lesser extent  the impact to our non controlling interests of the less favorable investment performance of the private investment vehicles we managed during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  year ended december  versus december  non controlling interests were a credit of million for the year ended december   compared to a charge of million for the year ended december  this change primarily reflects our employees and outside investors exclusive interest in the million loss of our operating company prior to the consummation of our reorganization on october   partially offset by their million interest in the income of the operating company subsequent to that date 
this change also reflects  to a lesser extent  the impact to our non controlling interests of the less favorable investment performance of the private investment vehicles we managed during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest on mandatorily redeemable units year ended december  versus december  there were no charges associated with interest on mandatorily redeemable units for the year ended december  as of march   the operating agreement of our operating company was amended to remove all mandatory redemption provisions related to our membership units 
the removal of these provisions caused our membership units to be classified as equity  and neither distributions  nor subsequent changes to these units value  were charged to income following the amendment 
years ended december  versus december  interest on mandatorily redeemable units decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the amendment of the operating agreement of our operating company as of march  to remove all mandatory redemption provisions related to our membership units 
the removal of these provisions caused our membership units to be classified as equity  and neither distributions  nor subsequent changes to these units value  were charged to income following the amendment 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the working capital needs of our business have primarily been met through cash generated by our operations 
distributions to members of our operating company and loan amortization payments have been our largest use of cash from financing activities 
investing activities have historically been investments in our own investment strategies and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  inclusive of million in cash held by our consolidated investment partnerships 
advisory fees receivable were million 
we also had approximately million in marketable equity securities  net of million in non controlling interests  and exclusive of approximately million in investments set aside to satisfy our obligations under our deferred compensation program 
we expect to fund the liquidity needs of our business in the next twelve months  and over the long term  primarily through cash generated from operations 
as an investment management firm  our business has been materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
our liquidity is highly dependent on the revenue and income from our operations  which is directly related to our levels of aum 
as of and for the year ended december   our aum and revenues declined by and  respectively  compared with the year ended december  these reductions contributed to a decline in our cash provided by operating activities during the same period 
to the extent that our aum continues to decline  the cash provided by operating activities may be negatively impacted 
in determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including  among other things  cash  working capital  investments  long term liabilities  lease commitments  debt obligations including required amortization payments  and operating company distributions 
further  we consider compensation  one of our largest expenses  as sufficiently variable such that it can be adjusted to mitigate the decline in revenue we have experienced  and may continue to experience in the next twelve months 
we continuously evaluate our staffing requirements and compensation levels with reference to our own liquidity position and external peer benchmarking data 
the result of this review directly influences management s recommendations to our board of directors with respect to such staffing and compensation levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our year end compensation packages and lowered headcount by approximately  as we took steps to reduce our overall cost structure 
we anticipate that tax allocations to the members of our operating company  which consisted of of our employees as of december   two outside investors  one former employee and us  will continue to be a material financing activity 
under the terms and conditions of our amended credit agreement and senior subordinated notes  we have suspended our dividend payment to shareholders 
cash distributions to operating company members for partnership tax allocations are expected to decline as the taxable income of the operating company decreases 
as discussed further below  on october   our operating company entered into a third amendment to its credit agreement and issued million in senior subordinated notes to entities established by richard s 
pzena  the company s ceo  for the benefit of certain of his family members  an entity controlled by a company director and a former employee 
the proceeds of the notes and million of cash reserves were used to reduce the principal amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
the amendment to the credit agreement  among other things  eliminated all financial covenants and the excess cash flow sweep  and reduced availability under the revolving credit facility from million to million 
it also requires us to make mandatory quarterly principal repayments of million and precludes us from paying dividends to shareholders 
as of december   we had million and million outstanding under the credit agreement and the senior subordinated notes  respectively 
although we are comfortable with our current capital structure  in the current economic environment  it is uncertain whether additional or alternative sources of debt or equity financing would be available on acceptable terms 
we have never drawn on our current revolving credit facility for liquidity needs and do not anticipate needing to draw on such a facility in the future 
we do not anticipate meaningful outlays for internal investment or capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we believe that the amendment of our credit agreement  elimination of the dividend  reductions in headcount and ability to vary cash compensation levels have provided us with an appropriate degree of flexibility in providing for our liquidity needs 
dividend policy we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockhoders  if any 
when and if our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the dividends declared 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common stockholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends or any of our financing facilities or other agreements restrict us from doing so 
pursuant to restrictions set forth in our amended credit agreement and the senior subordinated notes as of october   we have suspended previous quarterly cash dividend payments to our class a common stockholders 
in the future  our board of directors may  in its discretion and subject to the company s operating results  debt agreements and applicable law  reinstate the dividend at an amount to be determined by it 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 
credit agreement on july   our operating company borrowed million pursuant to a three year term loan facility the credit agreement  the proceeds of which were used to finance a special one time distribution to the members of our operating company as of that date 
concurrently  our operating company also obtained a million revolving credit facility to finance our short term working capital needs 
we refer to the term loan and revolving loan facilities as our credit agreement 
on february   our operating company entered into the first amendment to the credit agreement 
the amendment changed a number of credit agreement provisions  including i the minimum aum financial covenant was reduced from billion to billion  ii the minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  financial covenant for each four quarter period was reduced from million to million  iii the capacity of the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million  and iv the interest rate was increased from libor plus to libor plus 
in addition  two mandatory prepayment provisions were added a term loan amortization was required beginning in any period when aum was less than billion and ending when aum was greater than billion  and b a excess cash flow sweep was required if aum was below billion 
during the three months ended june   our assets under management fell below billion 
pursuant to the provisions of the term loan  as amended  our operating company was required to make an amortization payment of million on june  on september   our operating company entered into amendment no 
to its credit agreement 
the agreement  as amended  required the operating company to maintain assets under management of at least billion and to make minimum quarterly amortization payments of million until maturity  which was extended to july  additionally  the libor interest rate option was increased to libor plus and the ebitda financial covenant stipulated in amendment no 
was eliminated 
the excess cash flow sweep was also increased to of excess cash flow 
on september   our operating company made a required amortization payment of million as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this amendment 
on september   our operating company made a quarterly amortization payment of million 
on october   our operating company entered into amendment no 
to its credit agreement 
this amendment provided for the following changes to the credit agreement  among others i the minimum assets under management financial covenant was eliminated  ii the excess cash flow mandatory repayment was eliminated  iii the commitments under the revolving credit facility were reduced from million to approximately million  iv with respect to loans borrowed at base rate  the margin added to base rate was increased from to  with respect to loans borrowed at libor  the margin was not modified  v certain additional restrictions were placed on the operating company s ability to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement  including dividends  and vi amendments to certain covenants in order to permit the incurrence of subordinated debt by the operating company 
conditions precedent to the execution of amendment no 
included  among others  i the repayment by the operating company of million of the million principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement as of october   and ii the grant by the operating company and one of its subsidiaries of a security interest in their accounts receivable 
in order to fund the million repayment by our operating company  we used million in cash reserves and the proceeds from the issuance on october  of an aggregate of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes collectively  the notes to entities established by richard pzena  our company s chief executive officer  for the benefit of certain of his family members  an entity controlled by a company director  and a former employee of our operating company 
each of these notes is unsecured  has a ten year maturity and bears interest at per annum 
the provisions of the notes include a restricted payments covenant including dividend payments  a prohibition on incurring indebtedness which is not subordinated to the notes  and events of default based on failure to make payments  bankruptcy  change of control and acceleration of material indebtedness 
in addition  the notes are subordinated to the repayment in full of the loans under the credit agreement 
tax receivable agreement our purchase of membership units of our operating company concurrently with our initial public offering  and the future exchanges by holders of class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the exchange rights provided for in the operating company s operating agreement  has resulted in  and are expected to continue to result in  increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company at the time of our acquisition and these future exchanges  which will increase the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us 
these increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce  the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the current members of our operating company  the one member of our operating company immediately prior to our initial public offering who sold all of its membership units to us in connection with our initial public offering  and any future holders of class b units  that requires us to pay them of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by us  or a change in control  as described in the tax receivable agreement as a result of the increases in tax basis described above and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement  including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement 
in october  the selling unitholders agreed to waive any payments that we are or will be required to make to them for the and tax years pursuant to the tax receivable agreement 
cash flows operating activities provided million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decline in cash flows from operating activities was driven primarily by a decrease in average aum from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december   which had a corresponding negative impact on total revenues 
this decline was partially offset by the full year impact of the reclassification of cash flows associated with the removal of the mandatory redemption provisions of the operating company s operating agreement noted below 
overall cash compensation declined in as we reduced our year end compensation packages and lowered headcount by approximately to reduce our overall cost structure 
operating activities provided million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change is due primarily to the fact that beginning on march   the effective date of an amendment to the operating agreement of our operating company to eliminate its obligation to redeem a member s units therein under any circumstance  as well as the acceleration of the vesting of all compensatory units then subject to vesting  distributions on all membership units are classified as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
as a result of this reclassification  net cash provided by operating activities has increased  and net cash provided by financing activities has decreased during the period from march to december  overall cash compensation fell slightly in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   in part due to the approximately million effect of the initial adoption on january  of the mandatory deferral provisions of our operating company s bonus plan 
investing activities consist primarily of investments in affiliates and other investment partnerships  as well as capital expenditures 
investing activities used million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this change was largely a result of capital expenditures undertaken in that were not replicated in investing activities used million for the year ended december and provided million for the year ended december  this change was driven primarily by capital expenditures associated with the build out of additional space in our new york office 
financing activities consist primarily of borrowing arrangements and contributions from  and distributions to  non controlling interests 
financing activities used million for the year ended december  and used million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to a reduction in distributions to non controlling interests associated with reduced operating company income and a suspension of our dividend payments 
this decrease was offset by million in repayments on our debt and the full year effect of the reclassification of cash flows associated with the removal of the mandatory redemption provisions of the operating company s operating agreement noted above 
financing activities used million for the year ended december  and provided million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to the fact that the amendment to the operating agreement of our operating company  as explained above  reclassifies distributions on all membership units as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows subsequent to march  contractual obligations the following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease term loan senior subordinated debt to related parties interest payments total off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition 
management believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
unit based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires the recognition of the cost of equity based compensation based on the fair value of the award as of its grant date 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we accounted for our unit based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
the adoption of fas r did not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
pursuant to fas r  we recognize compensation expense associated with the granting of equity based compensation based on the fair value of the award as of its grant date if it is classified as an equity instrument  and on the changes in settlement amount for awards that are classified as liabilities 
prior to march   our compensatory membership unit based awards had repurchase features that required us to classify them as liabilities 
accordingly  distributions paid on these membership units were classified as compensation expense 
in addition  changes to their redemption values subsequent to their grant dates have been included in compensation expense 
as of march   we accelerated the vesting of all compensatory units then subject to vesting 
the one time charge associated with this acceleration  approximately million  was recorded on march  our operating agreement was further amended as of march   such that our operating company will no longer be required to redeem any membership units for cash upon a member s termination or death 
accordingly  beginning with our interim financial statements for the three months ended june   our operating company is no longer required to include in compensation expense the distributions in respect of these membership units or the change in their redemption value 
consolidation our policy is to consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
we also consolidate non variable interest entities which we control as the general partner or managing member 
we assess our consolidation practices regularly  as circumstances dictate 
all significant inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated 
investments in private investment partnerships in which we have a minority interest and exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method 
such investments  if any  are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as investments in affiliates and are recorded at the amount of capital reported by the respective private investment partnerships 
such capital accounts reflect the contributions paid to  distributions received from  and the equity earnings of  the private investment partnerships 
the earnings of these private investment partnerships are included in equity in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are a c corporation under the internal revenue code  and thus liable for federal  state and local taxes on the income derived from our economic interest in our operating company 
the operating company is a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes 
our operating company has not made a provision for federal or state income taxes because it is the responsibility of each of the operating company s members including us to separately report their proportionate share of the operating company s taxable income or loss 
similarly  the income of our consolidated investment partnerships is not subject to income taxes  as such income is allocated to each partnership s individual partners 
the operating company has made a provision for new york city ubt 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
determining the valuation allowance requires significant management judgments and assumptions 
in determining the valuation allowance  we use historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
each quarter  we reevaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future profitability 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the million valuation allowance  assessed in against the deferred tax asset recorded in as part of our initial public offering  is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
if we were not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  evaluating our tax positions and establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to earnings would result 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas  on january  our fair value measurements relate to our interest rate swap  as well as our investments in marketable securities and securities sold short  which are primarily exchange traded securities with quoted prices in active markets 
the fair value measurements of the securities have been classified as level the fair value measurement of the interest rate swap has been classified as level  based upon the market prices for interest rate swaps with similar provisions and forward interest rate curves 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
fas permits an entity to elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  since we chose not to elect this fair value option  the impact of the adoption of this statement was not material 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations fas r which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
fas r establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii discloses the business combination 
this statement applies to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses  including transactions that occur without the transfer of any type of consideration 
fas r is effective for us on a prospective basis for all business combinations on or after january   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
the adoption of fas r on january  will apply to future acquisitions  and its impact will depend on the nature and volume of those transactions 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas amends arb no 
and establishes accounting and reporting standards that require non controlling interests previously referred to as minority interest to be reported as a component of equity  changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions  and upon a loss of control  retained ownership interest will be remeasured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
fas is effective for us on january   except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of fas will only impact the company s presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  as fas only affects financial statement disclosure  the impact of the adoption will be limited to financial statement disclosure 
in june  the fasb issued eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
the eitf release states that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
the adoption of eitf on january  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment adviser for the separate accounts we manage and the funds for which we act as sub investment adviser 
as noted in item a  risk factors  global markets have continued to experience unprecedented volatility  and a challenging business climate is forecast for the foreseeable future 
market conditions have resulted in a significant reduction in our assets under management  which directly impacts our revenues and net income 
a continued economic downturn and volatility in the global financial markets could also significantly affect the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments 
all of our revenue for the three years ended december  was derived from advisory fees  which are typically based on the market value of aum  which can be affected by adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange and equity prices 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of the holdings of our consolidated subsidiaries  which consist primarily of marketable securities 
at december   the fair value of these assets was million 
assuming a increase or decrease  the fair value would increase or decrease by million at december  interest rate risk the amounts that our operating company borrowed pursuant to the credit agreement  and any amounts our operating company borrows under the related revolving credit facility  will accrue interest at variable rates 
the operating company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that commenced on july  the swap  which expires on july   obligates us to pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount and requires the counterparty to pay us a floating interest rate based on the monthly libor interest rate 
the spread on the credit agreement is in addition to these amounts 
interest rate changes may  therefore  affect the amount of our interest payments related to any potential differential between the notional amount of the interest rate swap and amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  as well as any amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility 
such changes would correspondingly affect our future earnings and cash flows 
in addition  we have not entered any arrangement to hedge our exposure to interest rates from july  to july  for this one year period  interest rate changes would affect our future earnings and cash flows 
based on the consolidated debt obligations that we have as of december   we believe that our hedge would be unaffected in the event that interest rates were to increase by one percentage point
