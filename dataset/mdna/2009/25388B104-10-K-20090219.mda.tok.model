acquisitions and comparability of results we acquired direct response technologies  inc now dr marketing solutions  inc in january  mindvision  inc 
in june  netgiro systems ab in september  ia users club  inc dba customcd and digitalswift corporation in january and think subscription  inc in september the results of these acquisitions must be factored into any comparison of our results to the results for or see note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for pro forma financial information as if these entities had been acquired on january  critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we evaluate the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force  eitf issues no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as net revenue 
we act as the merchant of record on most of the transactions processed and have contractual relationships with our clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services 
table of contents rendered associated with the e commerce and other services provided to our clients and end customers 
our revenue is recorded as net as generally our clients are subject to inventory risks and control customers product choices 
we sell both physical and digital products 
revenue is recognized upon fulfillment and based upon when products are shipped and title and significant risk of ownership passes to the customer 
we also provide customers with various proprietary software backup services 
we recognize revenue for these backup services based upon historical usage within the contract period of the digital backup services when this information is available 
digital backup services are recognized straight line over the life of the backup service when historical usage information is unavailable 
shipping revenues are recorded net of any associated costs 
we also  to a lesser extent  provide fee based client services  which include website design  custom development and integration  analytical marketing  affiliate marketing and email marketing services 
if we receive payments for fee based services in advance of delivery  these amounts  if significant  are deferred and recognized over the service period 
provisions for doubtful accounts and transaction losses and authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition based upon our historical experience 
the provision for doubtful accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to operating expense  while the provision for authorized credits is recognized as a reduction of net revenues 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eift 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the company presents these taxes on a net basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates and assumptions that can affect the amount of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses we report in any financial reporting period 
we use estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  which are based on our historical experience and current trends 
we must estimate the collectability of our billed accounts receivable 
we analyze accounts receivable and consider our historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
credit card chargeback reserve 
we use estimates based on historical experience and current trends to determine accrued chargeback expenses 
significant management judgments are used and estimates made in connection with these expenses in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment  amortize certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period of time over which the assets will generate revenue or benefit our business 
we review assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value we are carrying on our financial statements for an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers non financial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
if there are indications that impairment may be necessary  we use an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine the impairment amount  if any 
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be necessary utilizing the two step approach prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets 
there have been no material impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years  and income taxes and deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record deferred tax assets for favorable tax attributes  including tax loss carryforwards 
we currently have us tax loss carryforwards  consisting solely of acquired operating tax loss carryforwards  and a lesser amount of acquired foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 
a portion of the benefit of the acquired tax loss carryforwards has been reserved by a valuation allowance pursuant to united states generally accepted accounting principles 
these valuation allowances of the deferred tax asset will be reversed if and when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
any future release of valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense 
there is uncertainty of future realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from acquired tax loss carryforwards due to anticipated limitations  including limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
therefore  a valuation allowance was recorded against the tax effect of such tax loss carryforwards 
at december   the company has a valuation allowance on approximately million of deferred tax assets related to acquired operating losses and other tax attributes as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
any future release of this valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
no provision has been made for federal income taxes on approximately million of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december  since we plan to indefinitely reinvest all such earnings 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes on such earnings 
the amount of us income taxes would be subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and for the impact of the step up in the basis of assets resulting from a section election made at the time of acquisition 
if these earnings were to be distributed  the income tax liability would be approximately million 
stock based compensation expense 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock grants and employee stock purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  for periods beginning in prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had elected to apply the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
accordingly  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb and related interpretations 
compensation expense for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the stock option exercise price 
we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method under which prior periods are not revised 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period 
the fair value of 
table of contents each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized using the straight line amortization method over the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense of million was charged to operating expenses during as stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income for is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our pro forma information required under sfas  for periods prior to  accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
in march the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
we have applied the provision of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as required prior to adoption of sfas r in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
see note in the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information regarding the impact of our adoption of sfas r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based compensation 
results of operations the following table presents certain items from our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenue for the years indicated 
revenue costs and expenses direct cost of services network and infrastructure sales and marketing product research and development general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of acquisition related intangibles total costs and expenses income from operations interest income other expense  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income revenue 
our revenue increased to million in from million in and million in the revenue increases were primarily attributable to growth in the number of online game and consumer electronic clients we served  increased sales from international sites  expanded strategic marketing 
table of contents activities with a larger number of clients  and acquisitions 
sales of security software products for pcs represent the largest contributor to our revenues 
acquisitions made during each of  and generated approximately  and of our total revenue for those years  respectively 
international e commerce sales have been stable at approximately  and of revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales of products for one software publisher client  symantec corporation  accounted for approximately of our revenue in  in and in in addition  revenues derived from proprietary digital river services sold to symantec consumers and onenetworkdirect tm sales of symantec products amounted to approximately of our total revenue in  in and in direct cost of services

the increase in compared with was primarily driven by revenue growth and increased cd supply and personnel costs incurred through the digitalswift and customcd acquisitions in january the increase in compared with was primarily due to approximately million in increased cd supply costs associated with higher gross sales and million in additional personnel costs to support our largest clients and handle increased sales volume 
as a percentage of revenue  direct cost of services increased to in from and in and  respectively 
we currently believe direct costs of services will remain relatively flat compared to in absolute dollars as costs associated with moderately higher cd sales volume are offset by lower costs and efficiencies related to the full integration of our cd companies 
this outlook assumes continued financial challenges for consumers and macroeconomic uncertainty which is expected to temper our revenue performance indefinitely 
if economic conditions improve or further deteriorate or we complete any future acquisitions we expect a correlating increase or decrease in direct cost of services in line with revenue 
network and infrastructure 
our network and infrastructure expenses primarily include personnel related expenses and costs to operate and maintain our technology platforms  customer service  data communication and data center operations 
network and infrastructure expenses were million in  up from million and million in and  respectively

the increases supported our revenue growth and were partially offset by million lower personnel costs due primarily to symantec corporation bringing certain customer service activities in house and the absence of workforce reduction related costs incurred in connection with the consolidation of our international customer service center located in ireland 
as a percentage of revenue  network and infrastructure costs increased to from and in and  respectively 
we currently believe network and infrastructure expenses will increase in absolute dollars in compared to as we continue to expand our global data center and customer service capacity

if economic conditions improve or further deteriorate or we complete any future acquisitions we expect a correlating increase or decrease in sales and marketing expenses 
product research and development 
our product research and development expenses include the costs of personnel and related expenses associated with developing  maintaining and enhancing our technology platforms and related systems 
product research and development expense was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in both and compared to the prior year were primarily due to additional workforce and facility costs in development and quality assurance 
recent acquisitions netgiro  customcd  digtalswift and think subscriptions comprised a total of approximately million of the increase in research and development costs in compared to our research and development investments supported on going initiatives in our e commerce infrastructure to advance global system scalability  our e marketing capabilities  data management and client reporting 
key enhancements implemented in included regulatory environmental fee management  subscription solutions and new online payment types

we capitalized million of internal software development employee and consultant labor costs in this capitalization was primarily related to design efforts on our new enterprise resource planning system and a new data management and reporting infrastructure 
we did not capitalize any significant costs related to internal software development in or as a percentage of revenue  product research and development expense increased to in from in and in we currently believe that product research and development expenses will increase moderately in absolute dollars in compared to  as a result of continued investments in product development required to remain competitive 
however  if global economic conditions continue to deteriorate  cost containment actions may result in lower product research and development spending in as compared to if we complete any future acquisitions we expect research and development expenses to increase in line with higher revenue

general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively

the increase in compared to resulted primarily from additional workforce related expenses required to support our global expansion and infrastructure investments and additional bank fees mainly through our netgiro systems acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in both and we currently believe that general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in compared to we plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support continued organic growth 
however  we expect these incremental expenses will be offset by efficiencies gained through the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning erp system  client reporting enhancements and cost containment measures 
if we complete any future acquisitions we expect a correlating increase in our general and administrative expenses in line with increased revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of computer equipment and office furniture and the amortization of purchased and internally developed software  leasehold improvements made to our leased facilities and debt financing costs 
computer equipment  software and furniture are depreciated under the straight line method using three to seven year lives and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the remaining length of the lease 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively

income from operations 
our income from operations in was million  down from million in and up from million in as a percentage of revenue  income from operations was in  in and in income from operations decreased during from and as a percentage of revenue as expenses grew faster than revenues primarily due to higher spending on global growth and operational efficiency initiatives 
interest income 
our interest income represents the total of interest income on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily due to the use of million in cash for our share repurchase program during the first quarter of also  interest income declined in due to significantly lower market yields on our portfolio 
the increase in interest income in compared to was primarily due to higher cash balances and slightly higher interest rates 

table of contents we currently anticipate interest income will decline in due to lower cash balances and lower market yields when compared to the company used about million of cash in january  which includes accrued interest of million  to satisfy the majority of holders of our convertible senior notes due who exercised their put option to require the company to repurchase their notes 
in total  of the million convertible senior notes were repurchased by the company

in  our tax expense was million  consisting of approximately million of current tax expense offset by approximately million of deferred tax benefit 
in  our tax expense was million  consisting of approximately million of current tax expense offset by million of deferred tax benefit 
in  our tax expense was million  consisting of approximately million of current tax expense offset by million of deferred tax benefit 
our effective tax rate for was compared to in and in differences in our effective tax rate from the us statutory rate are primarily due to our mix of earnings from international operations and the differences in statutory rates in these countries from the us rate 
as of december   we had us tax loss carryforwards of approximately million and foreign tax loss carryforwards of million 
these tax loss carryforwards consist solely of acquired net operating losses 
the us tax loss carryforwards expire in the years through however  we anticipate most us tax loss carryforwards will be utilized in the next few years 
there is uncertainty of future realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from acquired tax loss carryforwards due to anticipated limitations 
therefore  a valuation allowance was recorded against the tax effect of such tax loss carryforwards 
at december   the company has a valuation allowance on approximately million of deferred tax assets related to acquired operating losses and other tax attributes as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
any future release of this valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense

the major components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and short term receivables net of client payables 
our primary source of internal liquidity is our operating activities

all the securities are guaranteed by the department of education or the federal family education loan program ffelp with the exception of two securities which are and guaranteed by ffelp 
all of these securities continue to fail at auction due to illiquid market conditions 
we did determine a market value discount  due to current illiquid market conditions  of million of par value existed as of december  and recorded a temporary fair value reduction to other

the discounted cash flow model we used to value the securities included the following assumptions determination of the penalty coupon rate  frequency of reset period associated with each ars an average redemption period of seven years a contribution of the ars paying its contractually stated interest rate determination of the risk adjusted discount rate based on libor rates for these maturities plus market information on student loan credit spreads in aggregate the ars portfolio is yielding and we continue to receive of the contractually required interest payments 
we continue to believe that we will be able to liquidate at par over time 
accordingly  we treated the fair value decline as temporary 
we anticipate we have sufficient cash flow from operations to execute our business strategy and fund our operational needs 
we believe that capital markets are also available if we need to finance other investing alternatives 
see note for further information 
our principal commitments consist of interest and principal on our convertible senior notes and long term obligations outstanding under operating leases 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate continued capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to grow as our overall business grows and that operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands total amount and contractual obligations committed thereafter operating lease obligations convertible senior notes total we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations and acquisitions of businesses  products  services and other assets as well as licenses of technology related to our current business

any such transactions could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges for our operational  financial and management information systems  as well as unforeseen expenditures and other risks  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key customers  employees and business partners  difficulties in managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas  and difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
in addition  an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on any acquisition or that future acquisitions will not be dilutive to our current shareholders percentage ownership or to earnings 
with respect to our convertible senior notes due january  the notes  we are required to pay interest on the notes on january and july of each year so long as the notes are outstanding 
on january   we paid million in interest for the period july through december  the notes bear interest at a rate of and  if specified conditions are met  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes may be surrendered for conversion under certain circumstances  including the satisfaction of a market price condition  such that the price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold  the satisfaction of a trading price condition  such that the trading price of the 
table of contents notes falls below a specified level  the redemption of the notes by us  the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as defined in the related indenture  and the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the related indenture 
the initial conversion price is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  of principal amount of the notes 
we will adjust the conversion price if certain events occur  as specified in the related indenture  such as the issuance of our common stock as a dividend or distribution or the occurrence of a stock subdivision or combination 
in addition  contingent interest is required to be paid to holders if certain conditions are met 
if a fundamental change  such as a change in our control  as defined in the related indenture  occurs on or before january   we may also be required to purchase the notes for cash and pay an additional make whole premium payable in our common stock upon the repurchase or conversion of the notes in connection with the fundamental change 
holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes prior to maturity on january   and we have the right to redeem the notes  under certain circumstances  on or after july  and prior to january   and we may redeem the notes at any time on or after january  on january   we announced that holders of of the notes exercised the option to require us to repurchase those notes on january  at a purchase price of of the principal amount of each tendered note 
we paid an aggregate of approximately million in connection with this repurchase  which includes million in interest

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments is maintained in a variety of securities  including government obligations and money market funds 
investments are classified as available for sale securities and carried at their market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the market value of certain securities in our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or utilize derivative financial instruments 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
the approximate gains or losses in earnings are estimates  and actual results could vary due to the assumptions used 
at december  and  we had million of fixed rate contingent convertible debt outstanding 
foreign currency risk a large portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar  and  therefore  is subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
because of our extensive international operations  we also face other risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statement of income 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses 
conversely  our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
the following schedule summarizes revenue  costs and expenses and income from operations that would have resulted had exchange 
table of contents rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results 
the effect on our consolidated statements of income from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  at prior exchange at prior exchange at prior exchange year rate as year rate as year rate as rates effect reported rates effect reported rates effect reported revenue costs and expenses income from operations represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results

transaction exposure the company enters into short term foreign currency forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non functional currencies 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives  as well as re measurement gains and losses  are recognized in current earnings in other income  net 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were a gain of million in  a loss of million in and a gain of million in translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax benefit or expense 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse currency movement is million and million for and  respectively
