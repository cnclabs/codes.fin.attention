item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the operating partnership is managed by its sole general partner  the company  a fully integrated  self administered and self managed equity reit that provides leasing  management  development  construction and other customer related services for our properties and for third parties 
the company conducts virtually all of its activities through the operating partnership 
as of december   we owned or had an interest in in service office  industrial and retail properties  encompassing approximately million square feet and rental residential units  which includes a interest in a  square foot office property directly owned by the company and thus is included in the company s consolidated financial statements  but not included in the operating partnership s consolidated financial statements 
as of that date  we also owned development land and other properties under development as described under business and properties above 
we are based in raleigh  north carolina  and our properties and development land are located in florida  georgia  iowa  kansas  maryland  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia

we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
results of operations comparison of to as noted above  results for were reclassified from previously reported amounts to reflect in discontinued operations the operations for those properties sold or held for sale in which qualified for discontinued operations presentation 
rental and other revenues while we own and operate a limited number of industrial  retail and residential properties  our operating results depend heavily on successfully leasing and operating our office properties 
economic growth in florida  georgia  north carolina and tennessee is and will continue to be an important determinative factor in predicting our future operating results 
the key components affecting our rental and other revenues are average occupancy  rental rates  new developments placed in service  acquisitions and dispositions 
average occupancy generally increases during times of improving economic growth  as our ability to lease space outpaces vacancies that occur upon the expirations of existing leases 
average occupancy generally declines during times of slower economic growth  when new vacancies tend to outpace our ability to lease space 
asset acquisitions  dispositions and new developments placed in service directly impact our rental revenues and could impact our average occupancy  depending upon the occupancy rate of the properties that are acquired  sold or placed in service 
a further indicator of the predictability of future revenues is the expected lease expirations of our portfolio 
as a result  in addition to seeking to increase our average occupancy by leasing current vacant space  we also must concentrate our leasing efforts on renewing leases on expiring space 
for more information regarding our lease expirations  see properties lease expirations 
whether or not our rental revenue tracks average occupancy proportionally depends upon whether rents under new leases signed are higher or lower than the rents under the previous leases 
the average rental rate per square foot on second generation renewal and relet leases signed in our wholly owned properties compared to the rent under the previous leases based on straight line rental rates was higher in than in the annualized rental revenues from second generation leases signed during any particular year is generally less than of our total annual rental revenues 
rental and other revenues from continuing operations were higher in as compared to primarily due to the contribution from development properties placed in service in and  higher average occupancy and higher average rental rates 
we expect a slight decline in total occupancy in primarily related to anticipated declines in occupancy at our industrial properties 
we expect to sell additional non core properties in that will likely be classified as discontinued operations 
we expect rental and other revenues to increase slightly over  adjusted for any discontinued operations in  due to the effect of new developments placed in service in and as discussed below  partly offset by the slight projected decline in occupancy 
we expect to deliver approximately million of new office and industrial development properties by the end of  which currently are pre leased 
operating expenses our expenses primarily consist of rental property expenses  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
for and  expenses also included impairments of assets held for use 
rental property expenses are expenses associated with our ownership and operation of rental properties and 
table of contents include expenses that vary somewhat proportionately to occupancy levels  such as common area maintenance and utilities  and expenses that do not vary based on occupancy  such as property taxes and insurance 
depreciation and amortization is a non cash expense associated with the ownership of real property and generally remains relatively consistent each year  unless we buy  place in service or sell assets  since we depreciate our properties and related building and tenant improvement assets on a straight line basis over a fixed life 
general and administrative expenses  net of amounts capitalized  consist primarily of management and employee salaries and other personnel costs  corporate overhead and long term incentive compensation 
rental and other operating expenses were approximately higher in as compared to primarily due to general inflationary increases in certain operating expenses  which include utility costs  insurance  real estate taxes  salaries  and benefits  and from expenses of development properties placed in service in and we expect rental and other operating expenses to increase in as compared to from utility and property tax increases and from development properties placed in service during the latter part of and in  partially offset by planned dispositions 
operating margin  defined as rental and other revenues less rental property and other expenses expressed as a percentage of rental and other revenues  was relatively unchanged at in as compared to the increase in depreciation and amortization of results primarily from development properties placed in service in the latter part of and in in  buildings in two business parks and one land parcel in winston salem  nc became impaired and an expense charge aggregating million was recorded  of which million related to the buildings and million to the land parcel 
in  one land parcel became impaired and an expense charge of million was recorded 
general and administrative expenses were approximately lower in as compared to primarily due to lower audit and legal fees and lower deferred compensation expense  partially offset by higher compensation costs including short and long term incentive compensation 
interest expense interest expense depends upon the amount of our borrowings  the weighted average interest rates on our debt and the amount of interest capitalized on development projects 
contractual interest expense is shown net of amounts capitalized to development projects 
the net decrease in contractual interest was primarily due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december   partly offset by an increase in average borrowings from  million in the year ended december  to  million in the year ended december  in addition  capitalized interest in was approximately million lower compared to due to decreased development activity and lower average construction and development costs 
total interest expense is expected to decrease in due to expected lower average outstanding debt balances resulting from the september equity offering and expected asset sales  offset by expected higher average interest rates resulting from projected new debt financings and lower capitalized interest 
gains on disposition of properties  gains on for sale residential condominiums  gain from property insurance settlement  minority interest  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net gains on dispositions of properties not classified as discontinued operations were million in compared to in gains are dependent on the specific assets sold  historical cost basis and other factors  and can vary significantly from period to period 
in  gains on for sale residential condominiums aggregating million resulted from sales of such condominiums and forfeitures of earnest money deposits by defaulting contractual counterparties 
our partner s interest in these gains was million and was recorded as minority interest 
in  we recorded a million gain from finalization of a prior year insurance claim 
minority interest in the company s consolidated statements of income decreased million in compared to primarily due to lower income from continuing operations  after preferred equity distributions  of 
table of contents the operating partnership as a result of the various charges discussed above  partially offset by the minority interest in gains on for sale residential condominiums

the increase in depreciation and amortization of primarily results from development properties placed in service in and in in  one land parcel became impaired and an expense charge of million was recorded 

table of contents general and administrative expenses were approximately higher in as compared to primarily due to higher write offs of deferred development costs on projects that did not proceed or were deemed unlikely to occur in the future  higher annual and long term incentive compensation costs  higher salary and fringe benefit costs from annual employee wage and salary increases and inflationary effects on other general and administrative expenses 
interest expense contractual interest expense is shown net of amounts capitalized to development projects

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview we generally use rents received from customers to fund our operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures and distributions 
to fund property acquisitions  development activity or building renovations and repay debt upon maturity  we may sell assets and or obtain new debt 
our debt generally consists of mortgage debt  unsecured debt securities and borrowings under our secured and unsecured credit facilities 
we also may sell or issue common or preferred equity to fund additional growth or to reduce our debt 
to generate additional capital to fund our growth and other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property  we may also sell some of our properties or contribute them to joint ventures 
our goal is to maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
our million unsecured revolving credit facility is currently scheduled to mature on may  as permitted under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we have submitted our notice to extend the maturity date of the credit facility by one year 
upon payment of the extension fee and assuming no default exists at may   the facility will be extended until may  as a result of this extension  we will have sufficient borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility to retire the approximate million of debt  as measured at february   that will mature including approximately million of required principal amortization payments relating to debt that matures in future years during the remainder of and fund the remaining costs of our current development pipeline 
in january  we paid off at maturity million of unsecured notes using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
because the cost and availability of credit  however  has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads  we expect to use less cash for investing activities in than in prior years 
based on management s view of current and future market conditions  we expect to generate a positive amount of cash from operating activities during we currently intend to use any such positive net cash flows from operating activities after payment of distributions and recurring capital expenditures  together with the proceeds from projected non core property dispositions and projected new debt financings  to reduce outstanding debt balances in these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
statements of cash flows as required by gaap  we report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
the following table sets forth the changes in the company s cash flows from to in thousands year ended december  change cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities total cash flows the following table sets forth the changes in the operating partnership s cash flows from to in thousands year ended december  change cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities total cash flows in calculating cash flow from operating activities  depreciation and amortization  which are non cash expenses  are added back to net income 
as a result  we have historically generated a positive amount of cash from operating activities 
from period to period  cash flow from operations depends primarily upon changes in our net income  as 
table of contents discussed more fully above under results of operations  changes in receivables and payables  and net additions or decreases in our overall portfolio  which affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense 
cash provided by or used in investing activities generally relates to capitalized costs incurred for leasing and major building improvements and our acquisition  development  disposition and joint venture activity 
during periods of significant net acquisition and or development activity  our cash used in such investing activities will generally exceed cash provided by investing activities  which typically consists of cash received upon the sale of properties and distributions of capital from our joint ventures 
cash used in financing activities generally relates to distributions  incurrence and repayment of debt and sales  repurchases or redemptions of common stock  common units and preferred stock 
as discussed previously  we use a significant amount of our cash to fund distributions 
whether or not we have increases in the outstanding balances of debt during a period depends generally upon the net effect of our acquisition  disposition  development and joint venture activity 
we use our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes  which means that during any given period  in order to minimize interest expense  we will likely record significant repayments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities of the company in compared to was primarily the result of the net decrease in the change in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by cash flows from net income as adjusted for changes in depreciation and amortization  gains on disposition of properties  impairments of assets held for use  gains from for sale residential condominiums  gain from a property insurance settlement  minority interest  and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
cash provided by operating activities of the operating partnership differs from cash provided by operating activities of the company primarily due to minority interest in the operating partnership included in the company s consolidated financial statements but not included in the operating partnership s consolidated financial statements 
the decrease of million in cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily the result of lower capital expenditure spending  higher proceeds from the dispositions of for sale residential condominiums and positive changes in restricted cash and other investment activities  partially offset by lower proceeds from disposition of real estate assets  lower returns of capital from unconsolidated affiliates  and higher contributions to unconsolidated affiliates  primarily for the formation of a new joint venture 
the decrease of million in cash used in financing activities in compared to the same period in was primarily the result of fewer retirements of preferred stock and preferred units  lower distributions on preferred stock and preferred distributions  substantially higher proceeds from the sale of common stock  higher net borrowings from mortgages and notes payable and our revolving credit facility  and lower repurchases of common units  partially offset by higher distributions resulting from an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding and lower contributions from minority interest partners 
cash used in financing activities of the operating partnership differs from cash used in financing activities of the company primarily due to cash used to repurchase common units included in the cash flows of the company but not included in the cash flows of the operating partnership 
capitalization the following table sets forth the company s capitalization in thousands  except per share amounts december  december  mortgages and notes payable  at recorded book value financing obligations preferred stock  at liquidation value common stock outstanding minority interest partnership units per share stock price at year end market value of common stock and common units total market capitalization with debt and obligations 
table of contents based on our total market capitalization of approximately billion at december  at the december  per share stock price of and assuming the redemption for shares of common stock of the approximate million common units not owned by the company  our mortgages and notes payable represented of our total market capitalization 
mortgages and notes payable at december  was comprised of million of secured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of and million of unsecured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   our outstanding mortgages and notes payable and financing obligations were secured by real estate assets with an aggregate undepreciated book value of approximately billion 
current and future cash needs rental and other revenues are our principal source of funds to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
other sources of funds for short term liquidity needs include available working capital and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and revolving construction credit facility which had million and million of availability  respectively  as of february  
our short term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses  interest and principal amortization on our debt  distributions  any payments under guarantee obligations and recurring capital expenditures  including building improvement costs  tenant improvement costs and lease commissions 
building improvements are recurring capital costs not related to a specific customer to maintain existing buildings 
recurring tenant improvements are the costs required to customize space for the specific needs of customers in spaces other than in new development projects 
notwithstanding the ongoing turbulence and uncertainty in the global capital markets  such as widening credit spreads and tightening underwriting standards which have negatively impacted the availability of capital across many industries  we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  with cash available from borrowings under our credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
as a result of the expected one year extension of our revolving credit facility  we will have sufficient borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility to retire the approximate million of debt  as measured at february   that will mature including approximately million of required principal amortization payments relating to debt that matures in future years during the remainder of and fund the remaining costs of our current development pipeline 
if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  our ability to pay distributions and satisfy other cash payments may be adversely affected 
see item a 
risk factors our use of debt to finance our operations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions 
our long term liquidity uses generally consist of the retirement or refinancing of debt upon maturity including mortgage debt  our revolving and construction credit facilities  term loans and other unsecured debt  funding of existing and new building development or land infrastructure projects and funding acquisitions of buildings and development land 
excluding recurring capital expenditures for leasing costs and tenant improvements and for normal building improvements  our expected future capital expenditures for started and or committed new development projects were approximately million at december  a significant portion of these future expenditures are currently subject to binding contractual arrangements 
additionally  we may from time to time retire some or all of our remaining outstanding preferred stock through redemptions  open market repurchases  privately negotiated acquisitions or otherwise 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of positive net cash flows from operating activities after payment of distributions and recurring capital expenditures  unsecured borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or new financing arrangements that we may obtain  secured borrowings under existing construction facilities or new financing arrangements that we may obtain at december   we had approximately billion of unencumbered real estate assets at undepreciated cost  the disposition of non core assets  the issuance by the operating partnership of unsecured debt securities  
table of contents the issuance of equity securities by the company and the operating partnership  and the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties  development projects and development land to strategic joint ventures to be formed with unrelated investors  which would have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions 
distributions to maintain its qualification as a reit  the company must pay dividends to stockholders that are at least of its annual reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
the company s reit taxable income  as determined by the federal tax laws  does not equal its net income under gaap 
in addition  although capital gains are not required to be distributed to maintain reit status  capital gains  if any  that are generated as part of our capital recycling activity are subject to federal and state income tax unless such gains are distributed to stockholders 
the partnership agreement requires the operating partnership to distribute at least enough cash for the company to be able to pay such dividends 
although the minimum common stock dividend per share required for the company to maintain its reit status excluding any net capital gains was and in and  respectively  our per share and per unit distributions during both years was 
cash distributions reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available for other business purposes  including funding debt maturities or future growth initiatives 
under temporary irs regulations  for  distributions can be paid partially using a reit s freely tradable common stock  provided that stockholders have the option of receiving at least of the total distribution in cash 
the amount and composition of future distributions will be made at the discretion of the company s board of directors 
for a discussion of the factors that will influence decisions of the board of directors regarding distributions  see item market for registrant s common stock  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
financing structure and activity in september  the company sold million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
as required by the terms of the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the net proceeds from the offering were contributed by the company to the operating partnership in exchange for million additional common units 
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering were subsequently used to repurchase  series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce the borrowings then outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
in january  we paid off at maturity million of unsecured notes using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our million secured construction facility  which bears interest at libor plus basis points  is initially scheduled to mature on december  assuming no defaults have occurred  we have options to extend the maturity date for two successive one year periods 
as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the construction facility 
our million unsecured revolving credit facility is currently scheduled to mature on may  as permitted under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we have submitted our notice to extend the maturity date of the credit facility by one year 
upon payment of the extension fee and assuming no default exists at may   the facility will be extended until may  we depend on our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes and for the short term funding of our development and acquisition activity and  in certain instances  the repayment of other debt upon maturity 
continuing ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility allows us to quickly capitalize on accretive opportunities at short term interest rates 
if our lenders default under their obligations under the revolving credit facility or we become unable to borrow additional funds under the facility for any reason  we would be required to sell additional assets or seek alternative equity or debt capital  which could be more costly and adversely impact our financial condition 
if such alternative capital were unavailable  we would not be able to make new investments and could have difficulty repaying other debt 

table of contents the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is libor plus basis points and the annual base facility fee is basis points 
the interest rate would increase to libor plus or basis points if our credit rating were to fall below investment grade according to two of three credit rating agencies

our million three year term loan is currently scheduled to mature on february  our million secured construction facility is currently scheduled to mature on december  assuming no defaults have occurred  we have options to extend the maturity date for two successive one year periods 
we have million of outstanding letters of credit as of december   which reduce the availability on our revolving credit facility 
as a result  the unused capacity of our revolving credit facility at december  was million 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the lenders that participate in our credit facilities using publicly available information  particularly in light of the current dislocations in the credit markets 
based on this review  we currently expect our lenders  which are major financial institutions  to perform their obligations under our existing facilities 
covenant compliance the operating partnership has million principal amount of bonds outstanding and million principal amount of bonds outstanding 
the indenture that governs these outstanding notes requires us to comply with customary operating covenants and various financial ratios  including a requirement that we maintain unencumbered assets of at least of all outstanding unsecured debt 
the trustee or the holders of at least in principal amount of either series of bonds can accelerate the principal amount of such series upon written notice of a default that remains uncured after days 
our revolving credit facility and our million bank term loan due in february also require us to comply with customary operating covenants and various financial requirements  including a requirement that we maintain a ratio of total liabilities to total asset value of no more than 
for purposes of the revolving credit facility  total asset value depends upon the effective economic capitalization rate after deducting capital expenditures used to determine the value of our buildings 
depending upon general economic conditions  the lenders have the good faith right to unilaterally increase the capitalization rate by up to basis points once each calendar year 
any such increase in capitalization rates  without a corresponding reduction in total liabilities  could 
table of contents make it more difficult for us to maintain a ratio of total liabilities to total asset value of no more than  which could have an adverse effect on our ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility 
upon an event of default  lenders having at least of the total commitments under the revolving credit facility can accelerate all borrowings then outstanding and prohibit us from borrowing any further amounts under our revolving credit facility  which would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants and requirements 
although we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants and ratios for at least the next year  depending upon our future operating performance  property and financing transactions and general economic conditions  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be in compliance 
we may not be able to repay  refinance or extend any or all of our debt at maturity or upon any acceleration 
if any refinancing is done at higher interest rates  the increased interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to pay dividends 
any such refinancing could also impose tighter financial ratios and other covenants that restrict our ability to take actions that could otherwise be in our best interest  such as funding new development activity  making opportunistic acquisitions  repurchasing our securities or paying dividends

off balance sheet arrangements we have several off balance sheet joint venture and guarantee arrangements 
the joint ventures were formed with unrelated investors to generate additional capital to fund property acquisitions  repay outstanding debt  fund other strategic initiatives and lessen the risks typically associated with owning of a property 
when we create a joint venture with a partner  we usually contribute cash or wholly owned assets to a newly formed entity in which we retain an equal or minority interest 
for financial reporting purposes  certain assets we sold have been accounted for as financing arrangements

financing arrangements sf hiw harborview plaza  lp our joint venture partner in sf hiw harborview plaza  lp harborview lp has the right to put its equity interest in harborview lp to us in exchange for cash at any time during the one year period commencing september  the value of the equity interest will be determined at the time that our partner elects to exercise its put right  if ever  based upon the then fair market value of harborview lp s assets and liabilities  less  which amount was intended to cover the normal costs of a sale transaction 
because of the put option  this transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction as described in note accordingly  the assets  liabilities and operations related to harborview plaza  the property owned by harborview lp  including any new financing by the partnership  remain in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we have established a financing obligation equal to the net equity contributed by the other partner 
at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the financing obligation is adjusted to equal the greater of the original financing obligation or the current fair value of the put option discussed above 
this financing obligation  net of payments made to our joint venture partner  is adjusted by a related valuation allowance account  which is being amortized prospectively through september as interest expense on financing obligation 
the amount of the financing obligation together with the valuation allowance was million at december  additionally  the net income from the operations before depreciation of harborview plaza allocable to the partner is recorded as interest expense on financing obligation 
we continue to depreciate the property and record all of the depreciation on our books 
any payments made under the master lease agreement were expensed as incurred  and million was expensed during the years ended december  and  respectively and any amounts paid under the tenant improvement and lease commission guarantee are capitalized and amortized to expense over the remaining lease term 
at such time as the put option expires or is otherwise terminated  we will record the transaction as a sale and recognize gain on sale 
eastshore in connection with the disposition in of three buildings located in richmond  va the eastshore transaction  we guaranteed any shortfalls that were incurred in the payment of rent and re tenanting costs for a five year period from the date of sale through november 
because the guarantees covered the entire space occupied by a single tenant under a triple net lease arrangement  our guarantees were considered a guaranteed return on the buyer s investment for an extended period of time  and therefore  we accounted for the transaction originally as a financing arrangement 
in july  we recorded the transaction as a completed sale when the maximum exposure to loss under the guarantees became less than the related deferred gain 
gain of million was recognized in and million in gain was recognized in as the maximum exposure under the guarantees was reduced 
payments made under rent guarantees after july were recorded as a reduction of the deferred gain 
tax increment financing bond in connection with tax increment financing for construction of a public garage related to an office building  we are obligated to pay fixed special assessments over a year period ending in the net present value of these assessments  discounted at at the inception of the obligation  which represents the interest rate on the 
table of contents underlying bond financing  is shown as a financing obligation in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also receive special tax revenues and property tax rebates recorded in interest and other income  which are intended  but not guaranteed  to provide funds to pay the special assessments 
in december  we acquired for million the remaining outstanding bonds  at par value  that were issued by a municipal authority in connection with this tax increment financing 
these available for sale securities are carried at estimated fair value in prepaid and other assets with unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the fair value of these bonds has been below carrying value for two quarters due to the current dislocations in the credit markets 
we believe these bonds will recover in value in the future due to the quality of the underlying collateral 
interest rate hedging activities to meet  in part  our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is adjusted at one and three month intervals  subject to settlements under these interest rate hedge contracts 
we also enter into treasury lock agreements from time to time in order to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates with respect to future debt offerings 
prior to  we entered into certain interest rate hedging arrangements which were designated as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of these arrangements  representing deferred interest expense  was million and million and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl as of december  and  respectively 
this deferred expense will be recognized as an addition to interest expense in the same periods during which interest expense on the hedged financings affects net income 
during  we entered into two floating to fixed interest rate swaps for a one year period with respect to an aggregate of million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  however  certain of our significant accounting policies contain an increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact in our consolidated financial statements 
management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following real estate and related assets  impairment of long lived assets  sales of real estate  discontinued operations  allowance for doubtful accounts  and property operating expense recoveries 
real estate and related assets real estate and related assets are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
renovations  replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and depreciable land infrastructure costs  years for building improvements and five to seven years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
tenant improvements are amortized using the straight line method over initial fixed terms of the respective leases  which generally are from three to years 
expenditures directly related to the development and construction of real estate assets are included in net real estate assets and are stated at depreciated cost in our consolidated balance sheets 
development expenditures include pre construction costs essential to the development of properties  development and construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
interest and other carrying costs are capitalized until the building is ready for its intended use 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements 
interest and other carrying costs are capitalized until the building is ready for its intended use  but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
expenditures directly related to the leasing of properties are included in deferred leasing costs and are stated at amortized cost in our consolidated balance sheets 
all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
internal leasing costs include primarily compensation  benefits and other costs  such as legal fees related to leasing activities  which are incurred in connection with successfully securing leases of properties 
capitalized leasing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the initial fixed terms of the respective leases  which generally are from three to years 
estimated costs related to unsuccessful activities are expensed as incurred 
changes in our estimates regarding the successful efforts of leasing could result in changes that impact earnings 

table of contents we record liabilities for the performance of asset retirement activities when the obligation to perform such activities is unconditional  whether or not the timing or method of settlement of the obligation may be conditional on a future event 
upon the acquisition of real estate assets  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets such as land  buildings and tenant improvements  intangible assets such as above and below market leases  acquired in place leases and other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities 
we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair values 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates as well as available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above and below market leases acquired are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets or in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities at their fair value 
fair value is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and any below market option periods 
in place leases acquired are recorded at their fair value in net real estate assets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the respective lease 
the value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider tenant improvements  leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses 
the value of in place leases is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
the value of a tenant relationship is based on our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered include the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of a tenant relationship is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the initial term and any renewal periods defined in the respective leases 
real estate and other assets are classified as long lived assets held for sale or as long lived assets to be held for use 
real estate is classified as held for sale when we believe a sale is probable 
we believe a sale is probable when we execute a legally enforceable contract on terms that have been approved by the company s board or a committee thereof and the probable buyer s due diligence investigation period  if any  has expired 
this determination requires us to make estimates and assumptions  including assessing the probability that potential sales transactions may or may not occur 
actual results could differ from those assumptions 
impairment of long lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates with respect to assets classified as held for use  if events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant decline in occupancy and change in use  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired  an impairment analysis is performed 
such analysis consists of determining whether the asset s carrying amount will be recovered from its undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows  including estimated residual cash flows 
these cash flows are estimated based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property 
if the carrying amount of a held for use asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the asset and the carrying amount 
we generally estimate the fair value of assets held for use by using discounted cash flow analysis 
in some instances  appraisal information may be available and is used in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis 
as the factors used in generating these cash flows are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the discounted and or undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows estimated by us in our 
table of contents impairment analyses or those established by appraisal may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize future impairment losses on our properties held for sale and held for use 
we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value 
fair value of assets held for sale is equal to the estimated or contracted sales price with a potential buyer  less costs to sell 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
with respect to investments in unconsolidated affiliates  if events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant decline in occupancy  degradation of economic conditions or change in use  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired  an impairment analysis is performed 
such analysis consists of determining whether a loss in value of an investment which is other than a temporary decline should be recorded 
sales of real estate for sales transactions meeting the requirements for full profit recognition  the related assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet and the resultant gain or loss is recorded in the period the transaction closes 
for sales transactions with continuing involvement after the sale  if the continuing involvement with the property is limited by the terms of the sales contract  profit is recognized at the time of sale and is reduced by the maximum exposure to loss related to the nature of the continuing involvement 
sales to entities in which we have or receive an interest are accounted for using partial sale accounting 
for transactions that do not meet the criteria for a sale  we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement  including put and call provisions  if present  and account for the transaction as a financing arrangement  profit sharing arrangement  leasing arrangement or other alternate method of accounting  rather than as a sale  based on the nature and extent of the continuing involvement 
some transactions may have numerous forms of continuing involvement 
in those cases  we determine which method is most appropriate based on the substance of the transaction 
if we have an obligation to repurchase the property at a higher price or at a future indeterminable value such as fair market value  or we guarantee the return of the buyer s investment or a return on that investment for an extended period  we account for such transaction as a financing arrangement 
for transactions treated as financing arrangements  we record the amounts received from the buyer as a financing obligation and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  are reflected as interest expense on the financing obligation 
if the transaction includes an obligation or option to repurchase the asset at a higher price  additional interest is recorded to accrete the liability to the repurchase price 
for options or obligations to repurchase the asset at fair market value at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the liability is adjusted to equal the then current fair value to the extent fair value exceeds the original financing obligation 
the corresponding debit or credit is recorded to a related discount account and the revised debt discount is amortized over the expected term until termination of the option or obligation 
if it is unlikely such option will be exercised  the transaction is accounted for under the deposit method or profit sharing method 
if we have an obligation or option to repurchase at a lower price  the transaction is accounted for as a leasing arrangement 
at such time as these repurchase obligations expire  a sale will be recorded and gain recognized 
if we retain an interest in the buyer and provide certain rent guarantees or other forms of support where the maximum exposure to loss exceeds the gain  we account for such transaction as a profit sharing arrangement 
for transactions treated as profit sharing arrangements  we record a profit sharing obligation for the amount of equity contributed by the other partner and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  are allocated to the other partner for its percentage interest and reflected as co venture expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in future periods  a sale is recorded and profit is recognized when the remaining maximum exposure to loss is reduced below the amount of gain deferred 
discontinued operations properties that are sold or classified as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations provided that the operations and cash flows of the property will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property after it is sold 
interest expense is included in discontinued operations if the related loan securing the sold property is paid off or assumed by the buyer 
table of contents in connection with the sale 
if the property is sold to a joint venture in which we retain an interest  the property will not be accounted for as a discontinued operation due to our significant ongoing interest in the operations through our joint venture interest 
if we are retained to provide property management  leasing and or other services for the property owner after the sale  the property generally will be accounted for as a discontinued operation because the expected cash flows related to our management and leasing activities will generally not be significant in comparison to the cash flows from the property prior to sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our total receivables balance related to our tenants is comprised primarily of rents and operating cost recoveries as well as accrued straight line rents receivable 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and considering such factors as the credit quality of our tenant  historical trends of the tenant and or other debtor and changes in customer payment terms 
additionally  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  we estimate the expected recovery through bankruptcy claims and increase the allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible 
if our assumptions regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable and accrued straight line rents receivable prove incorrect  we could experience write offs of accounts receivable or accrued straight line rents receivable in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
property operating expense recoveries property operating cost recoveries from tenants or cost reimbursements are determined on a lease by lease basis 
the most common types of cost reimbursements in our leases are common area maintenance cam and real estate taxes  where the tenant pays its pro rata share of operating and administrative expenses and real estate taxes 
the computation of property operating cost recovery income from tenants is complex and involves numerous judgments  including the interpretation of terms and other tenant lease provisions 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computation 
many tenants make monthly fixed payments of cam  real estate taxes and other cost reimbursement items 
we record these payments as income each month 
we make accrual adjustments  positive or negative  to cost recovery income to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements quarterly 
after the end of the calendar year  we compute each tenant s final cost reimbursements and  after considering amounts paid by the tenants during the year  issue a bill or credit for the appropriate amount to the tenant 
the differences between the amounts billed less previously received payments and the accrual adjustment are recorded as increases or decreases to cost recovery income when the final bills are prepared  which occurs during the first half of the subsequent year 
funds from operations ffo the company believes that ffo and ffo per share are beneficial to management and investors and are important indicators of the performance of any equity reit 
because ffo and ffo per share calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  management believes that the use of ffo and ffo per share  together with the required gaap presentations  provide a more complete understanding of the company s performance relative to its competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing and investing activities 
ffo and ffo per share as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo and ffo per share as described below 
however  you should be aware that ffo and ffo per share are non gaap financial measures and therefore do not represent net income or net income per share as defined by gaap 
net income and net income per share as defined by gaap are the most relevant measures in determining the company s operating performance because ffo and ffo per share include adjustments that investors may deem 
table of contents subjective  such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
furthermore  ffo per share does not depict the amount that accrues directly to the stockholders benefit 
accordingly  ffo and ffo per share should never be considered as alternatives to net income or net income per share as indicators of the company s operating performance 
the company s calculation of ffo  which it believes is consistent with the calculation of ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and which appropriately excludes the cost of capital improvements and related capitalized interest  is as follows net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  less dividends to holders of preferred stock and less excess of preferred stock redemption cost over carrying value  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  less gains  or plus losses  from sales of depreciable operating properties but excluding impairment losses and excluding items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis  and plus or minus adjustments for depreciation and amortization and gains losses on sales and minority interest related to discontinued operations 
further  in calculating ffo  the company adds back minority interest in the income from the operating partnership  which the company believes is consistent with standard industry practice for reits that operate through an upreit structure 
the company believes that it is important to present ffo on an as converted basis since all of the common units not owned by the company are redeemable on a one for one basis for shares of its common stock 
other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 

table of contents the company s ffo and ffo per share are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share funds from operations net income dividends to preferred stockholders excess of preferred stock redemption repurchase cost over carrying value net income available for common stockholders add deduct depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties minority interest from the operating partnership in income from operations unconsolidated affiliates depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties discontinued operations depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties minority interest from the operating partnership in income from discontinued operations release of fasb fin tax liability funds from operations weighted average shares outstanding includes assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future effects  but only indicators of reasonably possible effects 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had  million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
the estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt at december  was  million 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would increase by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding that was not protected by interest rate swaps 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower during the months ended december   our interest expense relating to this debt would be increased or decreased approximately million 
as of december   we had floating to fixed interest rate swaps with respect to an aggregate of million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  term loan or other floating rate debt 
the swaps fix the underlying libor rate under which interest on such borrowings is based at a weighted average of as of december  if libor interest rates increase or decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of the swaps as of december  would increase by million or decrease by million  respectively 
in january  two of our interest rate swaps with respect to an aggregate of million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt matured 
in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties  which are pnc bank  na and bank of america  na  under the swaps 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our counterparties using publicly available information  particularly in light of the current dislocations in the credit market 
based on this review  we currently expect the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  to perform fully under the swaps 
however  if a counterparty defaults on its obligations under the swap  we could be required to pay the full rates on the applicable debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract
