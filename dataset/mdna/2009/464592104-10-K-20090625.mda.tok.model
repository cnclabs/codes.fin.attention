impact of current economic conditions the current state of the united states economy has negatively impacted our results of operations through fiscal the turmoil in the credit and other financial markets  and in the broader global economy has exacerbated these trends and consumer confidence has been significantly impacted  as evidenced by broader indications of consumer behavior such as trends in auto and other retail sales 
we believe that our customers have reduced their discretionary spending as a result of these adverse economic conditions 
given these economic conditions  we have increasingly focused on managing costs 
given the uncertainty in the economy and the unprecedented nature of the situation with the financial and credit markets  forecasting future results has become very difficult

availability of cash and additional capital at april   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
as of april   we had million in revolving credit and million in term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
our net line of credit availability at april  was approximately million 
capital expenditures and development activities historically  we have made significant investments in property and equipment and expect that our operations will continue to demand ongoing investments to keep our properties competitive 
in fiscal we expect to invest approximately million in maintenance capital expenditures 
additionally  we have identified approximately million in projects primarily focused on refreshing our hotel room inventory as well as additional improvements to our black hawk and lake charles properties 
the timing an amount of these capital expenditures will be determined as we gain more clarity as to improvement of economic and local market conditions  cash flows from our continuing operations and availability of cash under our senior secured credit facility 
historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures through operating cash flow and debt financing 
while  we believe that existing cash  cash flow from operations  and available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  there is no assurance that these sources will in fact provide adequate funding for our planned and necessary expenditures or that our planned reduced levels of capital investments will be sufficient to allow us to remain competitive in our existing markets 
we are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms if our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient or if we fail to stay in compliance with the covenants of our senior secured credit facility 
we will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations 
as part of our business development activities  historically we have entered into agreements which have resulted in the acquisition or development of businesses or assets 
these business development efforts and related agreements typically require the expenditure of cash  which may be significant 
the amount and timing of our cash expenditures relating to development activities may vary based upon our evaluation of development opportunities  our financial condition and the condition of the financing markets 
our development activities are subject to a variety of factors including but not limited to obtaining permits  licenses and approvals from appropriate regulatory and other agencies  legislative changes and  in certain circumstances  negotiating acceptable leases 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  
table of contents those estimates where  had we chosen different estimates or assumptions  the resulting differences would have had a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations  and those estimates that  if they were to change from period to period  likely would result in a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
based upon management s discussion of the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  we believe the following accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill and other intangible assets at april   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  representing of total assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets below their carrying value 
for properties with goodwill and or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each property to carrying value 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  we engage an independent third party valuation firm to conduct annual impairment testing under sfas as a result of our annual impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at black hawk during fiscal and a million write down of goodwill at lula during fiscal year property and equipment at april   we had property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation of  million  representing of total assets 
we capitalize the cost of property and equipment 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition  changes in technology and new regulations could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  equipment and other long lived assets  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values 
if these estimates or the related assumptions are not achieved or change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
in evaluating impairment of long lived assets for newly opened operations  estimates of future cash flows and residual values may require some period of actual results to provide the basis for an opinion of future cash flows and residual values used in the determination of an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to reduce our blue chip assets held for sale to their estimated fair value less the cost to sell 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we engaged an independent third party valuation firm to conduct an appraisal of our long lived assets associated with our coventry  england due to the continuation of losses from operations  a review of expected future operating trends and the current fair values of our long lived assets in coventry 
based upon this appraisal  we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the write down of long lived assets at our coventry  england operations as of the end of fiscal self insurance liabilities we are self funded up to a maximum amount per claim for our employee related health care benefits program  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance 
claims in excess of this maximum are fully insured through a stop loss insurance policy 
we accrue a discounted estimate for workers compensation insurance and general liabilities based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
while the estimated cost of claims incurred depends on future developments  such as increases in health care costs  in our opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires that we recognize a current tax asset or liability for the estimated taxes payable or refundable based upon application of the enacted tax rates to taxable income in the current year 
additionally  we are required to recognize a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences 
temporary differences occur when differences arise between a the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and b the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in financial statements 
sfas also requires that any deferred tax asset recognized must be reduced by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits that  in our judgment and based upon available evidence  may not be realizable 
as of april   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires that tax positions be assessed using a two step process 
a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold  and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized 
uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date 
liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts  and are classified as current other accrued liabilities or long term other long term liabilities based on the time until expected payment 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
this policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin stock based compensation we apply the fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the estimate of the fair value of the stock options is calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
this model requires the use of various assumptions  including the historical volatility  the risk free interest rate  estimated expected life of the grants  the estimated dividend yield and estimated rate of forfeitures 
total stock option expense is included in the expense category corresponding to the employees regular compensation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
new development projects and pre opening costs we pursue development opportunities for new gaming facilities in our ongoing efforts to grow and develop the company 
projects that have not yet been deemed as probable to reach completion because they have not yet met certain conditions  including receipt of sufficient regulatory approvals  site control or related permits and or probable 
table of contents financing are considered by us to be in the development stage 
in accordance with statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities sop  costs related to projects in the development stage  except for those costs as detailed in sop  are recorded as an expense of new development at the corporate level and recorded on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations in the operating expense line item corporate development 
items for which a future value is probable  regardless of the project s outcome  may be subject to capitalization and subsequent depreciation and amortization 
for approved projects  certain eligible costs related to such projects are capitalized 
we follow the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  which are classified under the line item property and equipment  net on the balance sheet 
costs that are not capital in nature but either retain value or represent future liability  such as refundable utility deposits or a note payable  receive the appropriate balance sheet treatment 
all costs that are neither eligible for capitalization nor eligible for other balance sheet treatment  such as payroll  advertising  utilities and travel  are recorded as operating expenses when incurred 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings and have identified certain loss contingencies 
we record liabilities related to these contingencies when it is determined that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
these assessments are based on our knowledge and experience as well as the advice of legal counsel regarding current and past events 
any such estimates are also subject to future events  court rulings  negotiations between the parties and other uncertainties 
if an actual loss differs from our estimate  or the actual outcome of any of the legal proceedings differs from expectations  operating results could be impacted 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides information as of fiscal year  about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the table presents contractual obligations by due dates and related contractual commitments by expiration dates in millions 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases long term obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations estimated interest payment on long term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding at our fiscal year end and forecasted libor rates for our senior secured credit facility
