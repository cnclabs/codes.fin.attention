item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the caption risk factors in this report 
overview background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the in licensing and development of proprietary branded products and late stage product candidates for the treatment of diseases and disorders in the central nervous system therapeutic area 
we were incorporated in august upon in licensing our first product candidate  silenor 
we are a development stage company with no revenues to date 
we submitted our nda for silenor doxepin to the fda on january  the fda accepted the nda for filing effective march  pursuant to pdufa guidelines  the fda was expected to complete its review and provide an action letter with respect to nda by december  however  in november  the fda indicated that its review of the nda would be extended for up to three additional months  resulting in a new pdufa date of february  on february   we received a complete response letter from the fda relating to the nda 
the fda stated that based on its review the nda could not be approved in its present form 
in the complete response letter the fda raised a number of issues relating to the interpretation of the efficacy data contained in the nda and indicated that the fda was open to a discussion of these concerns 
the fda did not specifically request us to conduct additional clinical trials of silenor 
we believe that a discussion with the fda will be necessary to gain a complete understanding of the implications of the issues raised in the complete response letter  and we have scheduled a meeting with the fda for april  with respect to safety  the fda noted that there were no adverse events observed in the clinical studies included in the nda that would preclude approval  but asked us to address the possibility that doxepin may prolong the cardiac qt interval 
we have responded by submitting to the fda the results of our completed clinical trial of doxepin that evaluated the potential for ecg effects 
the results of this clinical trial demonstrated that doxepin had no effect on qt interval prolongation when administered at mg or under exaggerated exposure conditions of mg 
since our founding in  we have also entered into in license agreements for nalmefene and acamprosate 
in prior years  we conducted a phase clinical trial on nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling which did not show a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo  and a pilot phase clinical trial for nalmefene for smoking cessation which showed positive results 
in march  we and biotie entered into an agreement to mutually terminate the license agreement 
pursuant to this agreement  biotie agreed to pay us a million termination fee 
there are no further obligations under this license agreement 
with regards to acamprosate  we conducted formulation development work and after analyzing the results we made a determination to not move forward with the acamprosate program and terminated the in license agreement effective january we have incurred significant losses since our inception in in december  we completed our initial public offering 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect our accumulated deficit to continue to increase for the next several years as we manage the regulatory approval process for our silenor nda  complete the conduct of any non clinical studies and other regulatory requirements  prepare for the potential commercial launch of silenor  and potentially pursue development of other product candidates 
we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  debt financings  strategic relationships  assigning receivables or royalty rights  or other arrangements and cannot assure that the funding will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise 
table of contents sufficient additional funds  we may be required to reduce or curtail our operations and costs  and we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
revenues as a development stage company  we have not generated any revenues to date  and we do not expect to generate any revenues from licensing  achievement of milestones or product sales until we enter into a strategic collaboration or are able to commercialize silenor ourselves 
license fees our license fees consist of the costs incurred to in license our product candidates 
we expense all license fees and milestone payments for acquired development and commercialization rights to operations as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future use at this time 
research and development expenses to date  our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials managed by our cros  non clinical development program for silenor  costs associated with submitting and seeking approval of our nda for silenor  regulatory expenses  drug development costs  salaries and related employee benefits  as well as share based compensation expense 
in our most significant costs were associated with our development program for silenor  including the conduct of a voluntary standard clinical trial of doxepin  the active ingredient in silenor  designed to evaluate the potential for ecg effects  and the preparation of our nda for silenor 
during our most significant costs were associated with our development program for silenor  including the conduct of standard toxicology studies requested by the fda  and the preparation and submission of our nda for silenor 
in our most significant costs were associated with services provided by cros  investigators and consultants relating to our clinical trials 
we expense all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain a significant component of our operating expenses in the future as we continue our non clinical studies  seek nda approval for silenor and potentially pursue the development of other product candidates 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects and many resources are not attributable to specific projects 
accordingly  we do not account for our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
we use external service providers to conduct our non clinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture the product candidates used in our studies 
these external costs are accounted for on a project basis 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the regulatory approval process of our nda for silenor and the drug development process with respect to any other product candidates we may develop  and given the nature of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of product candidates for potential commercialization 
non clinical and clinical development timelines  the probability of success and the costs of development of product candidates vary widely 
the lengthy process of completing non clinical testing  seeking regulatory approval  and conducting clinical trials requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in obtaining regulatory approval  or completing non clinical testing or clinical trials for silenor or any future product candidates  would cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or other strategic transactions  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of product candidates or collaboration agreements  if at all 

table of contents marketing  general and administrative our marketing  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  share based compensation expense  advertising  market research costs  insurance and facility costs  and professional fees related to our marketing  administrative  finance  human resources  legal and internal systems support functions 
we anticipate increases in marketing  general and administrative expenses as we add personnel  prepare for the potential commercial launch of silenor and potentially pursue the acquisition and development of other product candidates 
interest and other income interest and other income consist primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we expect our interest income to decrease to the extent our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances decrease from continued operating losses 
interest and other expense interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense incurred on our outstanding debt 
we expect our interest expense to decrease to the extent we pay down our debt balance 
however  we are actively seeking additional financing and if such financing is in the form of additional debt  our interest expense will likely increase 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
license fees to date  the costs related to patents and acquisition of our intellectual property have been expensed as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures is in connection with our development efforts and has no alternative future use 
certain of our license agreements contain provisions which obligate us to make milestone payments or provide other consideration if specified events occur 
determining whether these events will occur  and the timing of such events  requires judgment on the part of management 
for instance  upon fda approval of silenor  we would owe a million milestone payment to our licensor 
as of december   we have not recognized this milestone in our financial statements 
additionally  we would capitalize costs related to our intellectual property once technological feasibility has been established and capitalized amounts would be amortized over the expected life of the intellectual property 
determining the extent to which a milestone may be earned  when technological feasibility has been achieved  and determining the related amortization period for capitalized intellectual property requires the use of estimates and subjective judgment 
research and development expenses our research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include expenditures relating to our clinical trials  non clinical studies  our nda filing for silenor and drug development costs 
measurement of these external research and development expenses often requires judgment as we may not have been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs  making it necessary to estimate the efforts completed to date and the related expense 
the period over which services are performed  the level of services performed as of a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
our principal vendors operate within terms of contracts which establish program costs and estimated timelines 
we assess the status of our programs through regular discussions between our program management team and the related vendors 
based on these assessments  we determine the progress of our programs in relation to the scope of work outlined in the contracts  and recognize the related amount of expense 
table of contents accordingly 
we adjust our estimates as actual costs become known to us 
changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations 
share based compensation statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in the statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
measurement and recognition of share based compensation under sfas no 
r involves significant estimates and subjective inputs 
the grant date fair value of share based payment awards is determined using an option valuation model  such as the black scholes model which we use 
the grant date fair value is affected by many complex and subjective assumptions  including estimates of our future volatility  the expected term for our stock options  including the consideration of option exercise behavior  and the number of shares expected to ultimately vest 
in addition  the period in which the expense is recognized requires judgment in assessing the timing and probability of vesting for our share based awards which contain performance vesting conditions 
our stock did not have a readily available market prior to our initial public offering in december  creating a short history from which to obtain data to estimate volatility for our stock price 
consequently  we generally estimate our expected future volatility based on comparable companies and our own stock price volatility to the extent such history is available 
our future volatility may differ from our estimated volatility at the grant date 
in estimating the expected term for our options  we applied the guidance in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
and sab no 
 which provide a formula driven approach for determining the expected term 
share based compensation recorded in our statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from actual forfeiture rates which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
certain of our share based awards would vest upon the achievement of performance conditions  generally surrounding fda approval or the potential commercial launch of silenor 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation expense of awards with performance conditions is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the time the applicable condition is met 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
as of december   we had not recognized in our financial statements expense related to certain of our performance based awards because at december  it was not considered probable that the fda would approve silenor or that we would achieve the commercial launch of silenor 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking estimates  the actual value of our stock options upon exercise could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we have incurred significant net operating losses to date 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and california net operating loss carryforwards of million 
federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire years after being generated and california net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire ten years after being generated 
we also have research and development credits as of december  of million for federal purposes and million for california purposes 
federal research and development credits begin to expire years after being generated and california research and development credits do not expire 
we have fully reserved our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits until such time that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than occurs within a three year period 
we determined that such an ownership change occurred as of june  due to various stock issuances used to finance our development activities 
this ownership change resulted in limitations on the utilization of tax attributes  including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we estimate that 
table of contents million of our california net operating loss carryforwards were effectively eliminated 
additionally  million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards  million of our state net operating loss carryforwards and million of our federal research and development credits were subject to the section limitation 
a portion of the limited net operating loss carryforwards becomes available for use each year 
we estimate that approximately million of the restricted net operating loss carryforwards become available each year between and  decreasing to million in and million per year thereafter 
at december   we estimate that million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of our state net operating loss carryforwards remain limited 
net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits generated subsequent to the ownership change are currently not subject to limitations  but could be subject to limitations in the future if additional ownership changes occur 
as of march   we have not updated our section analysis  which was completed in conjunction with our initial public offering in december debt and interest expense in may  we entered into a loan agreement under which we borrowed million  less debt issuance costs of million  for net proceeds of million 
in connection with the loan agreement  we issued warrants with a value of million which was allocated to equity and resulted in a corresponding debt discount 
in march  we repaid the entire remaining million principal amount of the loan  together with the final payment of million required under the loan agreement 
in connection with the repayment  we issued to the lenders an aggregate of  warrants having a ten year term and an exercise price of  which the lenders agreed to accept in lieu of the million prepayment penalty required under the loan agreement 
we no longer have any obligations under the loan agreement 
prior to our repayment of the loan  the lenders had the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in an event of default  which included  among other things  a material adverse change in our business  operations or financial condition or a material impairment in the prospect of repayment of the loan 
based on our recurring losses  negative cash flows from operations and working capital levels  and to reflect the lenders right to declare the loan immediately due and payable  we classified the december  outstanding debt balance as a current liability and classified the related restricted cash which collateralized this debt as a current asset 
in addition  as of december   we fully accreted to interest expense the debt discount  debt issuance costs  final payment and the value of the warrants issued in lieu of the prepayment penalty

silenor development costs also increased due to higher costs incurred during relating to efforts to prepare for the potential commercialization of silenor  offset by a reduction in development expenses due to the completion during of the majority of the non clinical studies requested by the fda our two year rat carcinogenicity study remains on going 
personnel and other costs decreased primarily due to bonus expense incurred during  but which was not incurred during as we did not accrue for a bonus during given certain cost reduction activities 
share based compensation  which is a non cash expense  increased million primarily due to share based awards granted during for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   research and development expense decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in expenses associated with silenor development work as a result of the completion of four phase clinical trials during expenses related to nalmefene and acamprosate decreased million primarily due to the conclusion of the phase clinical trial for the treatment of pathological gambling and the pilot phase clinical trial for smoking cessation during we discontinued our acamprosate development program during with no further costs expected to be incurred 
during  we reversed accrued expenses relating to silenor and nalmefene clinical trials of approximately million as a result of actual clinical trial expenses being less than previously accrued estimates

we did not have any debt or related interest expense prior to liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed through the private placement of equity securities  our initial public offering and debt 
cumulatively through december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock  and issuance of debt as follows net proceeds of million from the sale and issuance of an aggregate of  shares of preferred stock as follows from august through january  we issued and sold an aggregate of 
table of contents  shares of series a preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
from april through june  we issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of series b preferred stock for net proceeds of million after deducting offering costs of million 
in june  we issued and sold  shares of series c redeemable preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million after deducing offering costs of million 
in september  the warrant instrument  which was issued in conjunction with the june series c stock issuance  was exercised and we issued and sold an additional  shares of series c redeemable preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
net proceeds of million from the sale and issuance of an aggregate of  shares of common stock as follows in december  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering for aggregate net proceeds of million after deducting offering costs of million 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock at a ratio of six shares of preferred stock converting into one share of common stock 
since our inception on august  through december   we have issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options from which we have received aggregate proceeds of million 
net proceeds of million from the issuance of debt as follows in may  we entered into a loan and security agreement under which we borrowed million  less debt issuance costs of million for net proceeds of million 
interest payments were due monthly  but no principal repayment was due until january   at which time the debt was to be repaid through equal monthly installments 
we repaid the loan in full in march as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in united states government backed securities and money market funds placed with reputable financial institutions for which credit loss is not anticipated 
the capital markets have recently been highly volatile and there has been a lack of liquidity for certain financial instruments  especially those with exposure to mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
this lack of liquidity has made it potentially difficult for the fair value of these types of instruments to be determined 
our money market funds are with institutions that have minimal mortgage backed security exposure and we do not hold any auction rate securities 
all of our investments in money market funds and united states government backed securities continue to be highly rated  highly liquid and have readily determinable fair values 
as a result  none of our securities are considered to be impaired 
we have established guidelines relating to credit rating  diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
the diversity in maturities of our holdings provides us the capability to generally hold our securities until maturity  which we regularly do 
this allows any temporary changes in the value of our marketable securities due to market volatility to be recovered by the time the security matures 
to date  realized gains and losses from the sale of securities prior to their maturity have been negligible 
as of december   the longest time for maturity for any of our marketable securities is days with the weighted average time to maturity being days 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the costs and timing of regulatory approval  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing and other commercial capabilities  if required  the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses  the rate of progress and cost of our non clinical studies  clinical trials and other development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of development programs we pursue  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and 
table of contents the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
cash flows we expect to continue to incur losses and have negative cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future as we seek nda approval and prepare for the potential commercial launch of silenor 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in our net loss for as we voluntarily conducted a standard clinical trial during to evaluate the potential for ecg effects of doxepin  the active ingredient in silenor  and prepared for the potential commercialization of silenor 
we cannot be certain if  when  or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of silenor or any other product candidate that we may develop 
we expect our operating expenses to be substantial over the next few years as we seek approval of our nda for silenor  prepare for the potential commercial launch of silenor and potentially develop other product candidates 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources and through the sale of other equity securities  debt financings  assigning receivables or royalty rights or other strategic transactions 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining additional financing when needed  or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we also may not be successful in entering into strategic collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
if we are unsuccessful in raising sufficient additional funds  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate development plans or programs relating to our business  relinquish some or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development  renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or cease operating as a going concern 
if we are successful in raising additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we are successful in raising additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the sec 
this registration statement could allow us to obtain additional financing  subject to the sec s rules and regulations relating to eligibility to use form s in addition  in july  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s in conjunction with our ceff  which has not been declared effective by the sec 
our ability to conduct any drawdowns under the ceff is subject to the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement and other conditions 
one of these conditions is that the volume weighted average price of our common stock is above 
on march   the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market was 
under current sec regulations  at any time during which the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non affiliates  or public float  is less than million  the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve month period using shelf registration statements will be limited to an aggregate of one third of our public float 
as of march   our public float was approximately  shares  the value of which was approximately million based upon the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market of on such date 
as of march   the value of one third of our public float calculated on the same basis was approximately million 
as a result of recent volatility in the capital markets  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected 
concern about the stability of the markets in general and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

table of contents our independent auditors report for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about or ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements  and it is likely that investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in response to the fda s delay of the pdufa date for silenor in november and the complete response letter we received from the fda in february  we implemented certain cost reduction measures 
in december  we reduced our workforce by approximately  and in march we reduced our workforce by an additional 
in addition  in november  our board of directors amended the director compensation policy to provide that non employee directors will receive their quarterly retainers for service on the board of directors or committees thereof and their fees for attending meetings of the board and committees thereof in restricted stock units under our equity incentive award plan in lieu of cash compensation 
the compensation arrangement of david hale  our executive chairman of the board  was also amended in november so that his cash compensation for such role will also be payable in restricted stock units 
in addition  we did not make a cash bonus award under our incentive plan 
furthermore  we have been and will continue working with certain of our suppliers and vendors to manage our cash expenditures relating to our operations 
loan and security agreement in may  we entered into the loan agreement with silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation under which we borrowed million  less debt issuance costs of million  for net proceeds of million 
in connection with entering into the loan agreement  we issued warrants to silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and a ten year term 
in march  we repaid the entire remaining million principal amount of the loan  together with the final payment of million required under the loan agreement 
in connection with the repayment  we issued to the lenders an aggregate of  warrants having a ten year term and an exercise price of  which the lenders agreed to accept in lieu of the prepayment penalty required under the loan agreement

committed equity financing facility in may  we entered into the ceff with kingsbridge  pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to provide capital financing for a period of three years through the purchase of a maximum of approximately  newly issued shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations as set forth in the common stock purchase agreement 
our ability to conduct any drawdowns under the ceff is subject to the effectiveness of a resale shelf registration statement  which has not occurred as of march   and other conditions 
one of these conditions is that the volume weighted average price of our common stock is above

as of march   our public float was approximately million which was based on  shares held by non affiliates and a closing stock price of on such date 
the value of one third of our public float calculated on the same basis was approximately million 
in connection with the ceff  we filed a resale shelf registration statement on form s on july  with the sec to facilitate kingsbridge s public resale of the shares of our common stock issuable under the ceff or upon the exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
the resale shelf registration statement has not been declared effective by the sec 
in the event that an effective registration statement is not available for the resale of securities 
table of contents purchased by kingsbridge in connection with a draw down  under certain circumstances we may be required to pay liquidated damages to kingsbridge 
we have not conducted any draw downs under the ceff 
our ability to require kingsbridge to purchase our common stock under the ceff is subject to various limitations 
we can make draw downs of a maximum amount of  at our discretion  either i of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down  or ii the lesser of a of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down and b the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement 
neither i nor ii may exceed a million limit 
unless kingsbridge agrees otherwise  a minimum of three trading days must elapse between the expiration of any draw down pricing period and the beginning of the next draw down pricing period 
we may  from time to time  at our discretion  and subject to certain conditions that we must satisfy  draw down funds under the ceff by selling shares of our common stock to kingsbridge 
the purchase price of these shares will be at a discount ranging from six to twelve percent of the volume weighted average of the price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following our election to sell shares  or draw down under the ceff 
the discount on each of these eight trading days will be determined as follows  and the resultant price will be used to determine the number of shares issuable to kingsbridge with respect to one eighth of the aggregate draw down amount percent of applicable vwap vwap discount greater than per share less than or equal to per share but greater than per share less than or equal to per share but greater than per share less than or equal to per share but greater than or equal to per share as set forth in the common stock purchase agreement  vwap means the volume weighted average price the aggregate sales price of all trades of our common stock during each trading day divided by the total number of shares of common stock traded during that trading day of our common stock during any trading day as reported by bloomberg  lp using the aqr function 
the vwap and corresponding discount will be determined for each of the eight trading days during a draw down pricing period 
during the eight trading day pricing period for a draw down  if the vwap for any one trading day is less than the greater of i or ii of the closing price of our common stock for the trading day immediately preceding the beginning of the draw down period  the vwap from that trading day will not be used in calculating the number of shares to be issued in connection with that draw down  and the draw down amount for that pricing period will be reduced by one eighth of the draw down amount we had initially specified 
in addition  if trading in our common stock is suspended for any reason for more than three consecutive or non consecutive hours during any trading day during a draw down pricing period  that trading day will not be used in calculating the number of shares to be issued in connection with that draw down  and the draw down amount for that pricing period will be reduced by one eighth of the draw down amount we had initially specified 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant became exercisable in november and will remain exercisable  subject to certain exceptions  through november contractual obligations we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates

sfas no 
continues to be applicable for us beginning january  for 
table of contents financial assets and financial liabilities 
because of this deferral for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  we have only partially adopted sfas no 
as of december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  business combinations  which replaces sfas no  and in february  the fasb issued fsp r a which amends portions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no

r is effective for us beginning january  and will apply to business combinations completed on or after that date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb  which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests

fsp is effective upon issuance and clarifies that broker or pricing service quotes may not be indicative of fair value when markets are not active 
the use of a reporting entity s own assumptions level fair value measurement may be appropriate in a dislocated market where market transactions level fair value measurement are occurring largely from distressed sales or forced liquidations 
adoption of fsp did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  consisted primarily of money market funds and united states government agency notes 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to 
table of contents preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities consisting of money market funds and united states government debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we also generally time the maturities of our investments to correspond with our expected cash needs  allowing us to avoid realizing any potential losses from having to sell securities prior to their maturities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
our cash is invested in accordance with a policy approved by our board of directors which specifies the categories  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
we made this determination based on discussions with our treasury managers and a review of our holdings 
our money market funds are with institutions that have minimal mortgage backed security exposure and our debt holdings are in united states government backed securities 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are well diversified and do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that our investments will not be subject to future adverse changes in market value
