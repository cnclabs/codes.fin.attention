item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or in other parts of this annual report 
overview we develop and provide the leading software solutions for digital investigations  including encase enterprise  a network enabled product primarily for large corporations and government agencies  and encase forensic  a desktop based product primarily for law enforcement agencies 
we were incorporated and commenced operations in from through  we generated a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of our encase forensic products and related services 
we have experienced increases in our revenue as a result of the release of our encase enterprise products in late  which expanded our customer 
table of contents base into corporate enterprises and federal government agencies 
in addition  the releases of our encase ediscovery solution in late and encase information assurance solution in late have increased our average transaction size 
we anticipate that sales of our encase enterprise products and related services  in particular our encase ediscovery and encase information assurance solutions  will comprise a substantial portion of our future revenues 
factors affecting our results of operations there are a number of trends that may affect our business and our industry 
some of these trends or other factors include legislative and regulatory developments 
our digital investigation solutions allow law enforcement agencies  government organizations and corporations to conduct investigations within the legal and regulatory framework 
historically  the implementation of new laws and regulations surrounding digital investigations has helped create demand for our products 
future changes in applicable laws or regulations could enhance or detract from the desirability of our products 
information technology budgets 
deployment of our solutions may require a substantial capital expenditure by our customers 
budgets for information technology related capital expenditures at corporations and all levels of government organizations are typically cyclical in nature  with generally higher budgets in times of improving economic conditions and lower budgets in times of economic slowdowns 
law enforcement agency budgets 
we sell our encase forensic products and training services primarily to law enforcement agencies 
because of the limited nature of law enforcement budgets  funds are typically initially allocated toward solving issues perceived to be the most pressing 
sales of our products could be impacted by changes in the budgets of law enforcement agencies or in the relative priority assigned to digital law enforcement investigations 
prevalence and impact of hacking incidents and spread of malicious software 
the increasing sophistication of hacking attacks on government and private networks and the global spread of malicious software  such as viruses  worms and rootkits  have increased the focus of corporations and large government organizations on digital investigations and other aspects of network security  which has  in turn  increased demand for our products 
future changes in the number and severity of such attacks or the spread of malicious software could have an effect on the demand for our products 
seasonality in revenues 
we experience seasonality in our revenues  with the third and fourth quarters typically having the highest revenues for the year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from our customers budgeting cycles 
the federal government budget year ends in the third calendar quarter of the year and a majority of corporate budget years end in the fourth calendar quarter of the year 
in addition  our customers also tend to make software purchases near the end of a particular quarter  which tends to make our revenues for a particular period unpredictable for a significant portion of that period 
we expect that this seasonality within particular years and unpredictability within particular quarterly periods will continue for the foreseeable future 
amount of commercial litigation 
because commercial litigation often involves ediscovery  an increase in commercial litigation could increase demand for our products and services  while a decrease in commercial litigation could decrease demand 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our financial statements  included herein at item the application of gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and 
table of contents assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates are made 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  changes in these accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
although we evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated based on our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent there are significant differences between these estimates and actual results  our future results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below require the most subjective judgment and have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates  and their related disclosure in this report  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from licenses of our software and sales of related services  which include post contract customer support  or maintenance  consulting and training 
we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap as prescribed for the software industry  which are substantially governed by aicpa statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted 
while these pronouncements govern the basis for revenue recognition  in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue should be recognized currently and which portions  if any  should be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
in general  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable  as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
if we either enter into contracts or receive written purchase orders issued by a customer that legally bind us and the customer  we consider that as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
we deem delivery of products to have occurred when the title and risk of ownership have passed to the buyer 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the payment terms are within normal established practices 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we have a reasonable basis to expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue reported 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total purchase price irrespective of invoiced allocations among the various elements we deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
the vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when 
table of contents sold separately and  for software license updates and product support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
if we were to change our pricing practices or any of our other assumptions or judgments in the future  our future revenue recognition could differ significantly from our historical results 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements when revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
product revenue 
the timing of product revenue recognition is dependent on the nature of the product sold 
product arrangements comprising multiple deliverables  including software and hardware  are generally categorized into one of the following encase enterprise  encase ediscovery  and related products 
license revenue associated with these arrangements  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance and other undelivered elements for which we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
encase forensic 
license revenue from corporate customers  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance  for which we have vsoe of fair value  is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
because maintenance is included at no additional cost in governmental forensic arrangements  vsoe of fair value for the maintenance element for governmental customers is indeterminable  so we allocate governmental forensic product  services and maintenance revenue ratably over the longer of the contractual maintenance period months or the implied maintenance period typically  months based on estimated fair values of the various components 
premium license support program solutions 
the premium license support program is a subscription arrangement entitling customers to receive unspecified future products and post contract customer support for a period of several years 
revenue resulting from premium license support program arrangements is recognized ratably over the contractual period beginning with the delivery of the first product 
encase neutrino 
our mobile device investigative solution is sold to forensic customers with a related subscription covering future adapters for newly issued cell phones 
revenue is recognized over the related subscription period 
for enterprise customers  encase neutrino revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
standard maintenance is charged to entitle customers to future cell phone adapters on an if and when available basis 
hardware 
revenue associated with the sale of hardware is recognized upon shipment to the customer  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
services and maintenance revenue 
services and maintenance revenue consists of professional services  training  and maintenance 
revenue from such services is recognized as the services are provided 
we refer to revenue related to technical product support and software updates on a when and if available basis as maintenance revenue  which is recognized ratably over the applicable contractual period 
we determine the amount of maintenance revenue to be deferred through reference to substantive maintenance renewal provisions contained in each arrangement 
we consider substantive maintenance provisions to be provisions where the cost 
table of contents of the maintenance renewal  stated in the contract with our customer as a percentage of the product fee  is comparable to the normal pricing for maintenance only renewals 
substantially all of our customers purchase maintenance support when they acquire new software licenses and substantially all renew their maintenance support contracts annually or otherwise 
training revenues are either recognized on a per class basis upon a participant s attendance or  for those customers who have subscribed to our annual training passport program  revenue is recognized ratably over the annual period 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we used the minimum value method afforded by the sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for disclosure purposes 
since all options granted prior to january  were granted at exercise prices that were equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no share based compensation for stock options was recorded in the accompanying financial statements prior to and we are not required to record compensation expense for stock options granted prior to january  unless the terms of those options are subsequently modified 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method and  accordingly  since adoption  we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based awards granted after january  under that transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
with the exception of one option granted in december with market based vesting conditions  which is discussed further below  we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of share based payments and recognize that cost  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the determination of the grant date fair value of share based awards using that model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the estimated number of years that we expect employees to hold their stock options the option term and our expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividends to be paid on our stock over that term 
the expected term life of stock option awards has been calculated using the simplified method as afforded by staff accounting bulletins sab topic no 
and because we lack sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
we lack this historical data because of two factors first  our equity incentive plan the plan was adopted in and we do not have a sufficient history of exercises and forfeitures over the typical year life of our awards to predict future option holder behavior  which is critical in estimating an expected term for our options  and  second  we believe that our december initial public offering has likely changed the historical patterns that were experienced during the brief period of time from the plan s adoption to our initial public offering 
the volatility of our common stock is estimated at the date of grant based on a weighted average of the implied volatility of publicly traded day to day options on the common stock of a select peer group of similar companies similar companies  the historical volatility of the common stock of similar companies and  beginning in late  the historical volatility of our common stock  consistent with the requirements of sfas r and sab the risk free interest rate used in option valuation is based on the implied yield in effect at the time of each option grant  based on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent expected terms 
we use a dividend yield of zero in the black scholes model  as we have no intention to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
sfas r also requires that we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can potentially have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 

table of contents in december  we granted an option to purchase  shares of our common stock that vests  in increments  only upon attainment of specified market based conditions tied to the market value of our common stock and we may continue to award such market based vesting options from time to time in the future 
under the provisions of sfas r  the fair value of share based grants with a market vesting condition must be modeled and valued with a path dependent valuation technique 
accordingly  we estimate the value of such awards using the monte carlo binomial simulation model 
the primary assumptions used in the model are volatility  a risk free interest rate  starting stock price  transferability restrictions and the terms of the award  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
using these assumptions and inputs  in valuing the december grant  we simulated  possible price paths for our common stock over a ten year period 
for each trial  if the market conditions were met  the fair value of the option was then estimated using the black scholes model  if the market condition was not met  the options were assigned zero value 
the fair value of this award was then calculated as the average net present value across the simulation trials and a derived service period was calculated for achievement of each of the four market conditions 
under fas r  the calculated million fair value of this award must be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately two years whether the market conditions are met or not so long as the grantee meets the service condition 
if we change the terms of our employee share based compensation programs  refine future assumptions  such as experiencing forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  or if we change to other acceptable valuation models  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from historical trends and could materially affect our results of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded put and call options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our stock option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and monte carlo models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the grant date fair value of share based compensation awards may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those grants in the future 
certain stock options may be forfeited or expire and result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years for grants subsequent to january  see notes and of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is established through a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable  through consideration of the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
in addition  
table of contents we analyze our historical credit loss history and apply these loss rates to our current accounts receivable balances to verify the reasonableness of our allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in the future  which would result in increased general and administrative expense 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the foreign and domestic jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known  which can significantly impact our effective tax rate 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we periodically evaluate all pending or threatened contingencies and commitments  if any  that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position 
we assess the probability of an adverse outcome and determine if it is remote  reasonably possible or 
table of contents probable as defined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if management determines that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of our financial statements  and the amount of the loss  or the range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we record an accrued liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of the conditions pursuant to sfas no 
are not met  but the probability of an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible  we would disclose the nature of the contingency  if material  and provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss  or state that such an estimate cannot be made 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  any accruals recorded are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we would reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates favorably or unfavorably 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

product revenues increased by million in over  with that growth driven by a million revenue increase from our encase forensic product line and a million increase in other revenue 
the increase in forensic revenue is attributable to a larger number of governmental contracts completed during  including the united states securities and exchange commission and certain security and defense administrations 
as discussed herein  while portions of governmental forensic license revenues are deferred  the revenue increase is largely volume driven 
the increase in other revenue is largely attributable to new agreements to resell third party products licensed from hb gary and bit with our products during encase enterprise revenue grew modestly in after large increases in recent years as a result of market penetration  the uncertain economic environment and our introduction of the availability of our ediscovery product on a pay per use basis during the second half of we signed approximately new customers on a pay per use basis during late but will not begin recognizing revenue from this pricing model until early we expect revenues from our ediscovery and forensic products will grow at a moderate rate in

the effective tax rate in differed from the statutory rate of primarily due to research and development credits  offset by the impact of certain stock compensation charges under sfas no 
r and a partial valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate in differed from the statutory rate of primarily due to the company being treated as an s corporation until we revoked our s corporation status on december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have largely financed our operations from our cash flow from operations 
in december  we issued and sold  primary shares of our common stock at per share  for net proceeds of million in our initial public offering 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we generate cash from operations primarily from cash collections related to the sale of our products and services 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with net cash provided by operations of million in the decrease in cash provided by operations is the net result of a number of non cash items including higher share based compensation and depreciation expense  but also increasing 
table of contents investment in accounts receivable and lower accrued liabilities  and a lower increase in deferred revenues from the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to higher fourth quarter sales as cash collections were strong during the quarter 
the increase in cash collections resulted from higher sales volumes of existing products and new offerings although a portion of these cash flows must be deferred for recognition as revenue at a later date 
despite significantly higher revenues in  we were able to reduce the cash used to carry accounts receivable balances from million in to million in the million use of cash in operations during was largely attributable to increased payroll and related costs associated with additional sales  marketing and development personnel and higher accounts receivable balances 
the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year are our strongest quarters for cash collections  a consequence of the higher sales volumes typically experienced in the third and fourth quarters 
net cash used by investing activities was million in due solely to capital expenditures  primarily on our new erp system  whereas in  investing activities resulted in a million use of cash due to the maturities of short term investments 
this change is largely the result of our decision to invest a considerable portion of the proceeds of our december initial public offering in short term investments prior to year end  and subsequent decision to reinvest the proceeds upon maturity into cash equivalents during additionally  cash used in investing activities in consists of capital expenditures of approximately million for the purchase of new computer equipment and the construction and build out of new office facilities in pasadena  ca  new york  ny  and near san francisco  chicago and washington  dc  compared with million in capital expenditures during we presently expect capital expenditures to approximate million to million in  which we expect to fund from operating cash flows 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased from million in to million in due primarily to lower stock option exercises as well as a lower excess tax benefit from share based compensation 
cash from financing activities in decreased significantly from due to the non recurring net proceeds of our initial public offering in december in addition  we made a cash distribution to the shareholders in respect of s corporation taxable earnings in the amount of million during for which no corresponding payment was required in in each of the periods  we also paid down capital lease obligations 
we maintain a million line of credit with a bank 
this line of credit terminates on april  at december   there were no amounts outstanding against this line 
the line requires that we maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants associated with the revolving line of credit 
we currently have no material cash commitments  except our normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals and leases  all of which are currently expected to be funded through existing working capital and future cash flows from operations 
at december   our outstanding contractual cash commitments were largely limited to our non cancelable lease obligations  primarily relating to office facilities  as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our selling and marketing activities  the timing and extent of research and development spending to support product development and enhancement efforts  costs associated with expansion into new territories or markets  the timing of the introduction of new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
to the extent that our short term investments and existing cash  the availability under our line of credit and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our 
table of contents future activities and planned growth  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
furthermore  although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation or foreign exchange markets on our operations  we do not believe these external economic forces have had  or are likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on our results of operations 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose  or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have material relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed in this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements but rather defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of for financial assets and liabilities and are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of for nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
adoption of sfas with respect to financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations and we do not expect adoption of sfas with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas allows companies to elect fair value measurement when an eligible financial asset or financial liability is initially recognized or when an event  such as a business combination  triggers a new basis of accounting for that financial asset or financial liability 
sfas became effective for us on january   however we did not elect the fair value measurement provision for any of our financial assets or liabilities  so adoption of sfas had no effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items  including acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 

table of contents sfas r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
we will be required to adopt sfas r prospectively to any business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas r will only have an effect on our financial statements in the event that we enter into business combinations subsequent to that date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of operations 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
we will be required to adopt sfas effective january  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not have a noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that the initial application of sfas no 
will have an impact on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although we currently bill for our products and services mostly in us dollars  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
we are billed by and pay substantially all of our vendors in us dollars 
in the future  an increased portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies 
to date  exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results 
we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
our investment portfolio  consisting of short term fixed rate financial institution and commercial obligations at december   is subject to interest rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio
