table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
we consider the allowance for loan loss a critical accounting policy subject to estimate 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses in this management s discussion and analysis and allowance for loan losses in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is one of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect financial condition and results of operations 
material estimates particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the assessment of impaired loans  deferred income taxes  fair value measurements  the valuation of stock options and valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans 
in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of foreclosed assets held for sale  management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties 
review of financial condition securities at december   securities totaled million  compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or

the increase in total loans is primarily attributable to the decrease in undisbursed commitments as opposed to new loan originations 
at december   total undisbursed commitments to lend were million  compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
with few exceptions  we have suspended the origination of new real estate construction  land development and completed lot loans 
new loan originations for the year ended december   totaled million  down from billion for the year ended december  contractual maturities of loans  excluding loans held for resale and net of deferred fees  at december   are shown below in thousands

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is the amount which  in the opinion of management  is necessary to absorb future probable loan losses 
management s determination of the level of the provision for loan losses is based on various judgments and assumptions  including general economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  prior loan loss experience  the evaluation of credit risk related to specific credits and market segments and monitoring results from our ongoing internal credit review staff 
management also reviews the growth and terms of loans so that the allowance can be adjusted for probable losses 
the allowance methodology takes into account that the loan loss reserve will change at different points in time based on economic conditions  credit performance  loan mix and collateral values 
management and the board review policies and procedures at least annually  and changes are made to reflect the current operating environment integrated with regulatory requirements 
partly out of these policies has evolved an internal credit risk review process 
during this process  the quality grades of loans are reviewed and loans are assigned a dollar value of the loan loss reserve by degree of risk 
this analysis is performed quarterly and reviewed by senior management who makes the determination if the risk is reasonable and if the reserve is adequate 
this quarterly analysis is then reviewed by the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or  of total loans outstanding at december  this compares to the allowance for loan losses of million  or  of total loans outstanding at december   and million  or  at december  the increase in the allowance for loan loss for  as compared to and  is primarily attributable to the downturn in the economy and the negative impact on the local housing market  which significantly affected our real estate construction  land development and completed lot portfolios 
for the year ended december   net charge offs totaled million  compared to thousand for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  
table of contents the following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and the net losses  by loan type  for the years ended december in thousands balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses loans charged off commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other total charged off loans recoveries commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other total recoveries net charge offs recoveries balance before portion identified for undisbursed loans reserve acquired in merger portion of reserve identified for undisbursed loans and reclassified as a liability balance at end of year total loans at end of period daily average loans ratio of net charged offs recoveries during the period to average loans outstanding loan loss reserve as a percentage of total loans includes loans held for resale 
table of contents based on certain characteristics of the portfolio  potential losses can be anticipated by major loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  has been allocated among the major loan categories based primarily on their historical net charge off experience  along with consideration of factors such as quality  volume  anticipated economic conditions and other business considerations in thousands 
loan loan loan category category category reserve percent reserve percent reserve percent commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other unallocated portion of reserve identified for undisbursed loans and reclassifed as a liability loan loan category category reserve percent reserve percent commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other unallocated portion of reserve identified for undisbursed loans and reclassifed as a liability historical net charge offs are not necessarily accurate indicators of future losses since net charge offs vary from period to period due to economic conditions and other factors that cannot be accurately predicted 
thus  an evaluation based on historical loss experience within individual loan categories is only one of many factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the overall allowance 

table of contents nonperforming assets loans delinquent days or more or other nonaccruing  restructured and other real estate owned oreo  on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued at december are as follows in thousands commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction land development completed lots residential family installment and other total nonaccruing loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets restructured loans total loans at end of period total assets at end of period total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming assets to total assets includes loans held for resale for the years ended december  there are certain amounts of interest collected on nonaccrual loans that is included in income  and amounts that have not been accrued  which are indicated in the following table in thousands additional interest income which would have been recorded during the period under original loan terms interest collected and included in net income for the period commitments for additional funds related to loans above impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when management determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled in the loan agreement 
these loans include all loans in nonaccrual  loans restructured  and other loans that management considers to be at risk 
this assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are on nonaccrual or the loan has been restructured 
when a loan with unique risk characteristics has been identified as being impaired  the amount of impairment will be measured by the corporation 
if the current value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an existing allocation of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents nonaccrual loans it is the bank s practice to discontinue accruing interest on virtually all loans that are delinquent in excess of days regardless of risk of loss  collateral  etc 
some problem loans  which are less than days delinquent  are also placed into nonaccrual status if the success of collecting full principal and interest in a timely manner is in doubt 
some loans will remain in nonaccrual even after improved performance until a consistent timely repayment pattern is exhibited and or timely performance is considered reliable 
at december   nonaccruing loans totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in nonaccruing loans for the period is primarily attributable to the slow down in the housing market and general economy  which significantly impacted our real estate construction and land development portfolios 
of the total nonaccrual loans at december   relate to our real estate construction  land development and completed lot portfolios 
restructured loans in cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to the contractual terms  the loan is classified as a restructured accruing loan 
loans restructured at a rate equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the time of the contract is modified may be excluded from the impairment assessment and may cease to be considered impaired 
interest income on restructured loans is recognized pursuant to the terms of the new loan agreement 
interest income on impaired loans is monitored and based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement 
however  the recorded net investment in impaired loans  including accrued interest  is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair market value of the loan or the fair market value of the loan s collateral 
there were no restructured loans at december  or other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is carried at the lesser of book value or market value  less selling costs 
the costs related to completion  repair  maintenance  or other costs of such properties  are generally expensed with any gains or shortfalls from the ultimate sale of oreo being shown as other income or other expense 
the following table presents the activity related to oreo in thousands december  december  amount number amount number beginning balance additions to oreo capitalized improvements valuation adjustments disposition of oreo ending balance at december   oreo totaled million and consisted of properties in washington and oregon  with balances ranging from thousand to thousand 
at december   we had one oreo property totaling thousand 
certain other loans  currently in nonaccrual  are in the process of foreclosure and potentially could become oreo 
efforts  however  are constantly underway to reduce and minimize such nonperforming assets 
during  we expanded our special assets group from to individuals  all selected from within the company  to focus on reducing nonperforming assets 

table of contents intangible assets at december   intangible assets totaled thousand  compared to million at december  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill 
this write down resulted from goodwill impairment testing performed in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was performed due to the quarterly decline in the stock price and the resulting difference between the market capitalization and book value of the corporation 
the results of the goodwill impairment testing demonstrated that the estimated fair value of the corporation  or reporting unit  was less than the book value  resulting in full impairment

liquidity resources liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and payment of operating expenses 
the need for liquidity is affected by loan demand  net changes in deposit levels and the scheduled maturities of borrowings 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
liquidity is derived from assets by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell assets at market prices  earnings and by utilizing unpledged assets as collateral for borrowings 
liquidity is also derived from a variety of funding sources  including advances from the fhlb and other short and long term borrowings 
at december   the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling million 
at december   committed lines of credit agreements totaling approximately million were available to us from an unaffiliated bank 
there were no outstanding balances related to this line of credit at december  such lines generally provide for interest at the lending bank s federal funds rate or other money market rates and are short term in nature 
the corporation is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the corporation s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
for the year ended december   the bank paid the corporation million in dividends to fund regular operations and the quarterly cash dividend to shareholders

the million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million of net deposit increases and a million increase in net fhlb advances  partially offset by a million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and million in cash dividends paid 

table of contents capital requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
the minimum ratios and the actual capital ratios are set forth in the table below

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into off balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments for the extension of credit  credit card commitments  letter of credit commitments  home equity lines and standby letters of credit 
these instruments are recorded in the financial statements only when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received 
the following table summarizes the amount of commitments as of december  in thousands amount commitments to extend credit credit card arrangements standby and commercial letters of credit commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are written for one year  or have a call in one year 
the fair value of these commitments is not material since they are for a short period of time and subject to customary credit terms 
a fee is charged for all commitments to lend 
there have been no losses associated with these commitments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market pricing and rates 
a significant market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  deposit  borrowing and mortgage banking activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
a number of measures are utilized to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulation and gap analysis further discussed below under the subheading asset and liability management 
an income simulation model is primarily used to assess the impact on earning changes that interest rates may produce 
key assumptions in the model include cash flows and maturities of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and pricing  deposit sensitivity  consumer preferences and management s capital leverage plans 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may significantly differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and specific strategies  among other factors 
the model also uses a multiplier effect which is discussed later 
we use a simulation model to estimate the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings and capital 
the model calculates the change in net interest income under various rate shocks 
as of december   the model predicted that net income would increase by approximately thousand if rates increased 
since rates are currently at less than  the model did not predict any decreases in interest rates 
the percentages shown in the table below represent changes over a month period in net interest income and net income under two rate scenarios 
the cash flows have been adjusted to account for prepayments and other factors and an assumed tax rate 
in thousands estimated change estimated change estimated change rate shock net interest income na net income na the interest rate scenarios reflected above represent the results of possible near term interest rate movements 
approximately of the loan portfolio is tied to rate indexes that are one year or less in duration 
these indexes include our base rate  federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb advance rate  wall street journal prime  london interbank offering rate libor and constant maturity treasury cmt 
for the year ended december   our rates moved basis points downward 
at december   the model predicted that our net interest income would decrease by thousand and our net income would decrease by thousand  if rates decreased by 
actual net interest income decreased million and net income decreased million for  compared to our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital  while structuring the asset and liability components to obtain the maximum net interest margin 
we rely primarily on our asset and liability structure to control interest rate risk 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is the responsibility of the asset liability committee  which acts within policy directives established by the board of directors 
this committee meets regularly to monitor the composition of the balance sheet  to assess projected earnings trends and to formulate strategies consistent with the objectives for liquidity  interest rate risk and capital adequacy 
the objective of asset liability management is to maximize long term shareholder returns by optimizing net interest income within the constraints of credit quality  interest rate risk policies  levels of capital leverage and adequate liquidity 
assets and liabilities are managed by matching maturities and repricing in a systematic manner 
in addition to a simulation model  an interest rate gap analysis is used to measure the effect interest rate changes have on net interest income 
the gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative in the reverse situation 
however  the exact impact of the gap on future income is uncertain both in timing and amount because interest rates for our assets and liabilities can change rapidly as a result of market conditions and customer behavior patterns 

table of contents expected maturities for financial assets and liabilities in the following table in thousands  the expected maturities for financial liabilities  with no stated maturity  reflect assumptions using the run off rates for noninterest bearing deposits of per year  for now  sweep and money market accounts per year  and for savings accounts per year 
the weighted average interest rates for financial instruments presented are for year end expected maturity date fair thereafter total value financial assets cash and due from banks noninterest bearing fed funds sold variable rate weighted average interest rate securities available for sale fixed rate weighted average interest rate securities held to maturity fixed rate weighted average interest rate loans receivable  net fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate financial liabilities noninterest bearing deposits now  sweep and money market accounts weighted average interest rate savings accounts weighted average interest rate time certificates fixed rate weighted average interest rate federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase variable rate weighted average interest rate subordinated debt weighted average interest rate fhlb advances fixed rate weighted average interest rate represents tax equivalent yield represents weighted note rates exclusive of loan fees please note that in the above table  financial assets and liabilities are listed at their expected maturity date 
our variable rate financial assets may reprice much sooner than their expected maturity date and liabilities may or may not run off at the expected rate as indicated above 
therefore  we prefer to analyze our assets and liabilities as shown in the following chart  which indicates when the assets and liabilities can be repriced 

table of contents repricing opportunities for assets and liabilities in thousands as of december  thereafter total assets loans yield investments yield fed funds sold yield total earning assets yield liabilities now  money market  and sweep accounts cost savings cost time deposits cost fed funds purchased and repurchase agreements cost subordinated debt cost fhlb borrowings cost total interest bearing liabilities cost gap loan fees and costs are included in balance but not in the yield taxable equivalent amortized cost it is generally assumed that during a period of rising interest rates  the net earnings of an institution with a negative gap may be adversely affected due to its interest bearing liabilities repricing to a greater extent than its interest earning assets 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  net earnings may increase 
that assumption  however  is based on the premise that assets liabilities within a one year time frame will generally move in the same direction at approximately the same rate 
however  historical data reflects that the relationship between one year asset liabilities may not be as strongly correlated as assumed 
loans with one year repricing characteristics are tied to a number of indexes to include our base rate  the wall street journal prime  the one year constant maturity treasury  libor  and fhlb rates 
those indexes are subject to the movement of the one year market rates 
on the other hand  now and time deposits  which constitute the bulk of the one year repricing liabilities  are subject to the local financial institutions market 
pricing for now and time deposits is dependent on customer preferences and the subjective pricing influence of local banks  credit unions  etc 
thus  while a good portion of our loans are tied to national and international money markets  deposits are subject to the conditions of our market areas in washington and oregon 
additionally  when interest rates change  different rates change by different amounts 
the use of multipliers is used that represent the change of each asset liability rate compared to the change in the federal funds rate 
for example  the prime rate has a factor of indicating it changes the same amount as any federal funds rate change 
core deposit sectors may have a factor of  indicating those rates move only as much 
applying the multipliers to the balance sheet  at december   we had a positive gap of million  compared to a positive gap of million at december
