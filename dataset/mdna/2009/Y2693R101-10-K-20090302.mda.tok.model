we are a leading provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services 
as of december  our fleet consisted of vessels aframax vessels  suezmax vessels  two vlccs  two panamax vessels and four product carriers with a total cargo carrying capacity of million deadweight tons 
general maritime subsidiary is the predecessor of the company for purposes of us securities regulations governing financial statement filing 
the arlington combination is accounted for as an acquisition by general maritime subsidiary of arlington 
therefore  the disclosures throughout this annual report on form k and the accompanying consolidated financial statements  unless otherwise noted  reflect the results of operations of general maritime subsidiary for the years ended december  and and the financial position of general maritime subsidiary as of december  the company had separate operations for the period beginning december   the effective date of the arlington combination  and disclosures and references to amounts for periods after that date relate to the company unless otherwise noted

all share and per share amounts presented throughout this annual report on form k  unless otherwise noted  have been adjusted to reflect the exchange of shares of our common stock for each share of common stock held by shareholders of general maritime subsidiary in connection with the arlington combination 
spot and time charter deployment we actively manage the deployment of our fleet between spot market voyage charters  which generally last from several days to several weeks  and time charters  which can last up to several years 
a spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon total amount 
under spot market voyage charters  we pay voyage expenses such as port  canal and fuel costs 
a time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily rate 
under time charters  the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port  canal and fuel costs 
vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows  but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions 
vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates 
we are constantly evaluating opportunities to increase the number of our vessels deployed on time charters  but only expect to enter into additional time charters if we can obtain contract terms that satisfy our criteria 
net voyage revenues as performance measure for discussion and analysis purposes only  we evaluate performance using net voyage revenues 
net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses 
voyage expenses primarily consist of port  canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage  which would otherwise be paid by a charterer under a time charter 
we believe that presenting voyage revenues  net of voyage expenses  neutralizes the variability created by unique costs associated with particular voyages or the deployment of vessels on time charter or on the spot market and presents a more accurate representation of the revenues generated by our vessels 
our voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the spot market voyages and the lives of the charters  while direct vessel expenses are recognized when incurred 
we recognize the revenues of time charters that contain rate escalation schedules at the average rate during the life of the contract 
we calculate time charter equivalent  or tce  rates by dividing net voyage revenue by voyage days for the relevant time period 
we also generate demurrage revenue  which represents fees charged to charterers associated with our spot market voyages when the charterer exceeds the agreed upon time required to load or discharge a cargo 
we calculate daily direct vessel operating expenses and daily general and administrative expenses for the relevant period by dividing the total expenses by the aggregate number of calendar days that we owned each vessel for the period 
results of operations margin analysis for the indicated items as a percentage of net voyage revenues for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below 
income statement margin analysis of net voyage revenues year ended december  income statement data net voyage revenues direct vessel expenses other expense general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization loss gain on sale of vessels and equipment operating income net interest expense income other expense income net income income statement data dollars in thousands  except share data year ended december  voyage revenues voyage expenses net voyage revenues year ended december  compared to the year ended december  voyage revenues voyage revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase reflects a increase in vessel operating days  reflecting in part an increased utilization rate for our vessels  as well as increases in rates attained during for our vessels under time charter and spot charter as compared to the prior year 
included in this percentage increase is operating days for the two vlccs  two panamaxes  and four product carriers we acquired on december  pursuant to our merger with arlington 
an additional operating days during relates to our purchase of two aframax vessels during voyage revenues are expected to increase during as compared to as a result of the vessels acquired in late being in our fleet for all of voyage expenses voyage expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase in voyage expenses is primarily attributable to higher fuel costs incurred during fuel costs increased by per spot voyage day during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages  under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs 
during the year ended december   the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters decreased by to  days or  days for our aframax vessels and days for our suezmax vessels from  days  days for our aframax vessels and days for our suezmax vessels during the prior year 
voyage expenses are expected to increase during as compared to due to increases in the number of days our vessels are expected to be on spot charter during as compared to net voyage revenues net voyage revenues  which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
of this total increase  approximately million is attributable to the increase in the average size of our fleet which increased to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  product carrier for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax for the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in net voyage revenue is associated with stronger overall daily tce rates for suezmax and aframax vessels during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our average tce rates increased to  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the following is additional data pertaining to net voyage revenues year ended december  increase decrease change net voyage revenue in thousands time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a panamax a n a product a n a total spot charter aframax suezmax total total net voyage revenue vessel operating days time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a panamax a n a product a n a total spot charter aframax suezmax total total vessel operating days average number of vessels time charter equivalent tce time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a n a panamax a n a n a product a n a n a combined spot charter aframax suezmax combined total tce a acquired on december  as of december   of our vessels are on time charters expiring between july and july direct vessel expenses direct vessel expenses  which include crew costs  provisions  deck and engine stores  lubricating oil  insurance  maintenance and repairs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the company incurred higher crewing costs during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period which reflects higher crew wages in due in part to exchange rates on a substantially higher portion of crew wages paid in euros during the period as compared to the prior year period  as well as additional wage increases given to crews commencing during the second half of this increase is also associated with higher repair costs during the year ended december  associated with significant repairs including fuel consumed during the repair period on four of the company s suezmax vessels  as well as additional expenses of spare parts purchases and their delivery costs and costs associated with tank cleaning of several vessels pursuant to tank inspections required by charterers during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
lubricating costs were also higher during the year ended december  compared to the prior year associated with higher petroleum product costs 
in addition  the company recognized an expense of million during the period relating to a general average claim associated with a suezmax vessel 
these factors contributed to a rise in daily direct vessel expenses per vessel which increased by  or  to   aframax   suezmax   vlcc   panamax   product for the year ended december  compared to   aframax   suezmax for the prior year 
also contributing to the overall increase in direct vessel expense is an increase in the average size of our fleet which increased to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  product for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax for the prior year 
we anticipate that direct vessel expenses will increase to million during based on daily budgeted direct vessel expenses on our suezmax vessels  aframax vessels  two vlccs  two panamax vessels and four product carriers of     and  respectively 
the budgets for the aframax and suezmax vessels are based on actual results adjusted for certain events not expected to recur or anticipated events which did not occur in increases in daily budgets from actual results are primarily attributed to expected increases in crew costs and higher costs of lubricating oils 
budgets for the vlccs  panamax vessels and product carriers are based on contractual obligations with northern marine 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
significant factors contributing to this increase for the year ended december  compared to the prior year are a a million increase in compensation accruals in connection with our executive transition plan incurred in  including million to peter c 
georgiopoulos in connection with the termination of his employment arrangments with the company 
b an million payment in lieu of a cash bonus to peter georgiopoulos during the year ended december  peter georgiopoulos did not receive a cash bonus in the prior year when he was granted restricted shares  the expense of which is amortized over the vesting period of approximately years 
c million incurred during the year ended december  relating to fines and costs deemed to be uncollectible from insurers relating to a conviction in a criminal proceeding involving the genmar defiance 
d million of financial advisory fees during the year ended december  associated with financial advisory services received pursuant to our determination to pay a special dividend 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
daily general and administrative expenses per vessel increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
for  we have budgeted general and administrative expenses to be approximately million 
this budget reflects reductions in payroll attributable to lower head count in relating to severance costs incurred during and reduction in expenses associated with the corporate aircraft  the lease for which will terminate in february depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  which include depreciation of vessels as well as amortization of drydocking and special surveys  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
vessel depreciation increased by million to million during year ended december  compared to million during the prior year period 
this increase is due to increased depreciation during relating to the additions to our fleet of the genmar st 
nikolas in february  the genmar elektra in october  the genmar daphne in december  and the eight vessels we acquired in the arlington combination in december amortization of drydocking increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
drydocks are typically amortized over periods from months to months 
this increase reflects amortization during of a portion of the million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended december  and amortization for the full year of the million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended december  loss gain on sale of vessels and equipment during the years ended december  and  we incurred losses of million and million  respectively  associated with the disposal of certain vessel equipment 
interest income interest income decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates on deposits during compared to interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is attributable to the increase in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility during and the addition of the rbs facility in december during the year ended december   our weighted average outstanding debt increased by to million compared to million during the prior year 
this increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest rates during compared to on our floating rate debt 
we expect our long term debt during to approximate the debt level at december  because this amount is greater than our weighted average debt for the year ended december   we expect our interest expense to be higher during as compared to other income expense other expense for the year ended december  was million which an aggregate realized loss on our freight derivatives of million partially offset by an unrealized gain on our freight derivatives of million 
other expense for the year ended december  was million which is comprised primarily of an aggregate realized loss on our freight derivatives of million and an unrealized loss on our freight derivatives of million 
net income net income was million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the prior year 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  voyage revenues voyage revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease reflects a decrease in vessel operating days  reflecting in part a decreased utilization rate for our vessels  as well as a decrease in the proportion of our vessel operating days relating to spot charters  spot charter rates are generally higher than time charter rates to allow the vessel owner to recoup voyage expenses which are paid for by the charterer under time charters 
voyage expenses voyage expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease in voyage expenses is primarily due to a decrease in the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters 
substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages  under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs 
during the year ended december   the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters decreased by  or  to  days  days aframax  days suezmax from  days  days aframax   days suezmax during the prior year 
although port costs  which can vary depending on the geographic regions in which the vessels operate and their trading patterns  decreased by during to million from million during the prior year  port costs per spot charter day increased by approximately associated with the increase in in the proportion of such spot days associated with aframax tankers 
aframax spot market voyages are generally of shorter durations than suezmax spot market voyages  resulting in more port calls during the year and consequently higher port costs 
fuel costs decreased by approximately during to million from million during the prior year 
although fuel prices were higher in as compared to  fuel cost per spot days remained relatively unchanged 
this is due to the increase in in the proportion of spot market voyage days associated with aframax tankers  which consume significantly less fuel than do suezmax vessels 
net voyage revenues net voyage revenues  which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
of this total decrease  approximately million is attributable to the decrease in the average size of our fleet which decreased to vessels aframax  suezmax for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax for the prior year 
approximately million of the decrease in net voyage revenue is associated with weaker overall daily rates for suezmax and aframax vessels during the year ended december  compared to the prior year

effects of inflation the company does not consider inflation to be a significant risk to the cost of doing business in the current or foreseeable future 
inflation has a moderate impact on operating expenses  drydocking expenses and corporate overhead 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds  cash management since our formation  our principal sources of funds have been equity financings  issuance of long term debt securities  operating cash flows  long term bank borrowings and opportunistic sales of our older vessels 
our principal use of funds has been capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet  maintain the quality of our vessels  comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations  fund working capital requirements and repayments on outstanding loan facilities 
beginning in  general maritime subsidiary and subsequently the company also adopted policies to use funds to pay dividends and  from time to time  to repurchase our common stock 
see below for descriptions of our dividend policy and our share repurchase program 
our practice has been to acquire vessels or newbuilding contracts using a combination of funds received from equity investors  bank debt secured by mortgages on our vessels and shares of the common stock of our shipowning subsidiaries  and long term debt securities 
because our payment of dividends is expected to decrease our available cash  while we expect to use our operating cash flows and borrowings to fund acquisitions  if any  on a short term basis  we also intend to review debt and equity financing alternatives to fund such acquisitions 
our business is capital intensive and its future success will depend on our ability to maintain a high quality fleet through the acquisition of newer vessels and the selective sale of older vessels 
these acquisitions will be principally subject to management s expectation of future market conditions as well as our ability to acquire vessels on favorable terms 
as the arlington combination was structured as a stock for stock combination  we funded the acquisition of arlington through an issuance of shares in exchange for the shares of the combined entities 
we expect to rely on operating cash flows as well as long term borrowings and future equity offerings to implement our growth plan  dividend policy  and share repurchases 
we believe that our current cash balance as well as operating cash flows and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next year 
our operation of ocean going vessels carries an inherent risk of catastrophic marine disasters and property losses caused by adverse severe weather conditions  mechanical failures  human error  war  terrorism and other circumstances or events 
in addition  the transportation of crude oil is subject to business interruptions due to political circumstances  hostilities among nations  labor strikes and boycotts 
our current insurance coverage includes protection and indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability  which is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations  hull and machinery insurance for actual or constructive loss from collision  fire  grounding and engine breakdown  war risk insurance for confiscation  seizure  capture  vandalism  sabotage and other war related risks and loss of hire insurance for loss of revenue for up to days resulting from a vessel being off hire for all of our vessels

management anticipates that vessels which are younger than years are required to undergo in water surveys years after a drydock and that vessels are to be drydocked every five years  while vessels years or older are to be drydocked every years in which case the additional drydocks take the place of these in water surveys

other derivative financial instruments freight derivatives as part of our business strategy  we have and may from time to time enter into freight derivative contracts to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
generally  these freight derivative contracts are futures contracts that would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified notional amount of tonnage forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
these contracts generally settle based on the monthly baltic tanker index bitr  which is a worldscale index  and a may also include a specified bunker price index 
the bitr averages rates received in the spot market by cargo type  crude oil and refined petroleum products  and by trade route 
the duration of a contract can be one month  quarterly or up to three years with open positions settling on a monthly basis 
although freight derivatives can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  our objective has been to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
to the extent that we enter into freight derivatives  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market

also during january  we entered into an agreement with a counterparty for the five month period from february to june which stipulated a spread between gulf coast fuel oil and houston fuel oil of mt 
the notional amount of fuel oil was  mt each month and the prices of each commodity were determined based on the average closing trading prices during each month 
to the extent the spread was less than mt  we were to pay the counterparty  to the extent the spread is greater than mt we were to collect from the counterparty 
because this contract expired on june   the fair value of this contract is as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized a realized gain of million which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations

we consider all of our fuel derivative contracts to be speculative 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recorded when services are rendered  the company has a signed charter agreement or other evidence of an arrangement  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our revenues are earned under time charters or spot market voyage contracts 
revenue from time charters is earned and recognized on a daily basis 
certain time charters contain provisions which provide for adjustments to time charter rates based on agreed upon market rates 
revenue for spot market voyage contracts is recognized based upon the percentage of voyage completion 
the percentage of voyage completion is based on the number of spot market voyage days worked at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of days expected on the voyage 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we do not provide any reserve for doubtful accounts associated with our voyage revenues because we believe that our customers are of high creditworthiness and there are no serious issues concerning collectibility 
we have had an excellent collection record during the past seven years 
to the extent that some voyage revenues become uncollectible  the amounts of these revenues would be expensed at that time 
we provide a reserve for our demurrage revenues based upon our historical record of collecting these amounts 
as of december   we provided a reserve of approximately for these claims  which we believe is adequate in light of our collection history 
we periodically review the adequacy of this reserve so that it properly reflects our collection history 
to the extent that our collection experience warrants a greater reserve we will incur an expense as to increase this amount in that period 
in addition  certain of our time charter contracts contain speed and fuel consumption provisions 
we have a reserve for potential claims  which is based on the amount of cumulative time charter revenue recognized under these contracts which we estimate may need to be repaid to the charterer due to failure to meet these speed and fuel consumption provisions 
depreciation and amortization 
we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our double hull tankers on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
we believe that a year depreciable life for double hull and double sided vessels is consistent with that of other ship owners and with its economic useful life 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
we estimate our residual scrap value per lightweight ton to be an increase in the useful life of the vessel would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
an increase in the residual scrap value would decrease the amount of the annual depreciation charge 
a decrease in the useful life of the vessel would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
a decrease in the residual scrap value would increase the amount of the annual depreciation charge 
replacements  renewals and betterments 
we capitalize and depreciate the costs of significant replacements  renewals and betterments to our vessels over the shorter of the vessel s remaining useful life or the life of the renewal or betterment 
the amount capitalized is based on our judgment as to expenditures that extend a vessel s useful life or increase the operational efficiency of a vessel 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with gaap and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of our vessels 
costs that are not depreciated are written off as a component of direct vessel operating expense during the period incurred 
expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
if the amount of the expenditures we capitalize for replacements  renewals and betterments to our vessels were reduced  we would recognize the amount of the difference as an expense 
deferred drydock costs 
our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
we capitalize the costs associated with the drydocks as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydocks 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with gaap guidelines and industry practice  and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the vessels 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  we review certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  vessel sales and purchases  business plans and overall market conditions 
we determine undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each vessel and compare it to the vessel carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  we would determine the fair value of the related asset and we record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
various factors including future charter rates and vessel operating costs are included in this analysis 
goodwill 
we follow the provisions for sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and written down with a charge to operations when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we amortized goodwill

based on tests performed  we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  and recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt 
at december   we had million of floating rate debt with a margins over libor of ranging from to compared to december  when we had million of floating rate debt with a margin over libor of 
as of december   the company is party to five interest rate swaps which effectively fix libor on an aggregate million of its outstanding floating rate debt to a fixed rates ranging from to 
a one percent increase in libor would increase interest expense on the portion of our million outstanding floating rate indebtedness  which is not hedged  by approximately million per year from december  foreign exchange rate risk the international tanker industry s functional currency is the us dollar 
virtually all of the company s revenues and most of its operating costs are in us dollars
