table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading integrated global provider of carbon compounds and commercial wood treatment products 
our products are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end markets  including the aluminum  railroad  specialty chemical  utility  rubber and steel industries 
we serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network  which includes manufacturing facilities located in the united states  australia  china  the united kingdom and denmark 
we operate two principal businesses carbon materials chemicals cm c and railroad utility products r up 
we believe that our cm c business is the largest distiller of coal tar in north america  australia  the united kingdom and scandinavia 
we process coal tar into a variety of products  including carbon pitch  creosote and phthalic anhydride  which are critical intermediate materials in the production of aluminum  the pressure treatment of wood and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals  respectively 
we believe that our r up business is the largest north american supplier of railroad crossties 
our other commercial wood treatment products include the provision of utility poles to the electric and telephone utility industries 
our cm c business has entered into a number of strategic transactions during the last two years to expand and focus on its core business related to coal tar distillation and derived products 
in november  tangshan koppers kailuan carbon chemical company limited tkk was established which is constructing and will operate a new tar distillation facility in the hebei province near the jingtang port with a distillation capacity of  metric tons 
we hold a percent investment in tkk which is expected to commence production in the second quarter of in november  we completed a project to expand the capacity of our existing percent owned tar distillation plant in tangshan  china from  metric tons to  metric tons 
on october   we sold our percent interest in koppers monessen partners lp monessen to arcelormittal sa for cash of million plus working capital of million 
net cash proceeds  after deduction for the limited partner interest  taxes and transaction costs  were approximately million 
the company recognized an after tax gain of million 
monessen is a metallurgical furnace coke facility 
effective as of the end of the second quarter of  monessen was classified as a discontinued operation in the company s statement of operations and its assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale in the balance sheet 
accordingly our financial statements and earnings per share have been restated for prior periods 
in july  we sold our percent interest in koppers arch investments pty limited and its subsidiaries koppers arch to arch chemicals inc for net cash proceeds of million and recognized a gain from the sale  net of tax  of million 
effective as of this date  koppers arch was classified as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations and earnings per share and our financial statements have been accordingly restated 
koppers arch was a manufacturer of timber preservation chemicals 
monessen and koppers arch were part of our carbon materials chemicals business segment 
outlook trend overview our businesses and results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including i the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products both in the united states and overseas  ii raw materials pricing and availability  in particular the amount and quality of coal tar available in global markets  which could be negatively impacted by reductions in steel production  iii volatility in oil prices  which impacts selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstocks and phthalic anhydride  iv competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets  v low margins in the utility pole business  and vi changes in foreign exchange rates 
our businesses and results of operations have been impacted by the downturn in the global economy in late and we expect that these negative trends will continue in certain key end markets have experienced significant global reductions in demand that will negatively impact the demand for our products 
in late and continuing into we have seen 
table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report significant reductions in global production of aluminum  steel  rubber  concrete  plastics and paints  among others  that represent markets in which our products are consumed 
we are watching these markets very closely and believe that there will be uncertainty regarding the levels of production going forward 
due to the nature of our end markets  we could see some level of demand improvement as government stimulus is introduced 
in recent months we have seen the temporary idling or closure of several aluminum smelters 
we expect the trend of closing or reducing production at higher cost smelters to continue as newer  more cost effective smelters come on line in regions with lower cost energy  particularly in the middle east 
as an example we have seen specific closures in north america and europe that will negatively impact volumes in those geographic areas  at this time we can not predict if or when these idled smelters will return to production 
however  we believe we are well positioned to supply the new middle eastern smelters due to our capacity expansions in china 
we expect to produce lower volumes in in many of our products which will impact the capacity utilization at our facilities 
lower throughput volumes combined with increasing pressure for price reductions has led us to review our capacity utilization and has resulted in production cutbacks at certain facilities  which will result in lower margins 
if these trends continue  we may temporarily idle or permanently close facilities 
utility pole markets are expected to continue to remain competitive with resulting low margins 
we will continue to review underperforming assets and rationalize capacity as necessary to remain competitive in this market and will reduce market share if warranted 
several of our products  particularly carbon black feedstocks and phthalic anhydride  have end market pricing that is linked to benchmark oil indices 
during the past few years we have benefited in terms of revenues and profitability from the higher pricing for these products as the cost of coal tar has not increased proportionally with oil 
however  when the price of oil declined in late we saw significant price and profit declines for these products that we expect will continue in the availability of a key raw material  coal tar  is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production 
as the global steel industry has reduced production of steel and metallurgical coke the volumes of coal tar by product were also reduced 
our ability to obtain coal tar and the price we are able to negotiate have a significant impact on the level of profitability of our business 
most notably we have continued to see price increases in north america for coal tar due to lower availability and the pricing terms in our purchasing contracts 
many of our sales contracts include provisions that allow for price increases based on increases in the price of raw materials  which has allowed us to generally maintain profit dollars in our core businesses 
however  significant increases in raw material costs will result in margin dilution because only the increased cost of the raw material is passed on to the customer 
the north american railroad market has experienced better stability than our other end markets in recent months  however  continued negative economic trends could impact the demand for crossties from the short line railroads as well as the class railroads 
additionally  lumber availability and pricing were negatively impacted in by weather conditions as well as the depressed markets for furniture and hardwood flooring caused by the dramatic decline in the us housing market 
while weather conditions are difficult to predict  it is likely that housing will remain depressed during and may result in continued difficulties related to cost and availability for crossties 
net sales over the past several years have been significantly impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates in australia  great britain  europe  denmark and china 
in late and continuing into we saw those trends begin to reverse 
exchange rates for currencies in australia  great britain  europe  denmark  and to a lesser extent  china  have changed significantly and will negatively impact sales and profits in compared to in addition  we expect continued volatility in these exchange rates that could impact our ability to accurately predict future levels of sales and profits 
seasonality and effects of weather on operations our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control  including inclement weather conditions  which in the past have affected operating results 
operations at several facilities have been halted for short periods of time during the winter months 
moreover  demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather 
as a result of the foregoing  we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  our operating results have been significantly lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters 
we expect this seasonality trend to continue in future periods 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  consolidated results net sales for the years ended december  and are summarized by segment in the following table year ended december  net change dollars in millions carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products cm c net sales increased by million or percent due to the following changes in volume  pricing and foreign exchange price volume foreign exchange net change carbon materials a distillates b coal tar chemicals c other d total cm c a includes carbon pitch and refined tar 
b includes creosote and carbon black feedstock 
c includes naphthalene and phthalic anhydride 
d includes carbon black  benzole  freight and other products 
carbon materials prices increased in the us and china as customer prices were increased in response to substantially higher raw material costs 
an increase in carbon materials sales volume was realized primarily in australia and europe totaling three percent and was partially offset by decreases in china of one percent 
distillate pricing improved due to price increases in carbon black feedstock prices in europe and creosote prices in the us totaling three percent 
the increase in carbon black feedstock pricing is consistent with higher average worldwide oil prices during the year 
the increase in distillate sales volume is due primarily to increased creosote sales in the us totaling one percent 
for coal tar chemicals  increases in phthalic anhydride prices of one percent were partially offset by lower naphthalene prices in europe 
the decrease in coal tar chemicals volumes is due primarily to lower phthalic anhydride volumes of one percent 
with respect to other products  carbon black volumes  freight  specialty chemicals and other carbon products increased five percent as compared to the prior year and were partially offset by lower commercial roofing sales 
carbon black prices experienced an increase of one percent as compared to the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to experience negative pricing and volume trends due to lower commodity prices and global economic issues for most of the products listed above 
we expect these trends to impact sales volumes and margins into

b includes sales from treatment services only tso 
c includes transmission poles  pilings  creosote  freight and other treated and untreated lumber products 
sales were negatively impacted by volume decreases of untreated railroad crossties totaling four percent for the year ended december  due to capital purchasing reductions by the class railroads and reduced raw material availability due to weather and a weak timber market 
treated railroad crossties pricing increased by one percent for the year ended december  as raw material price increases were passed on to customers 
the price increase in other products is due primarily to higher creosote prices and transmission pole prices totaling two percent 
the lower volumes in other products is due primarily to lower sales of untreated lumber products 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the year ended december  overall  cost of sales increased by million when compared to the prior year period due primarily to higher raw material costs 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million higher when compared to the prior year period and included an impairment charge of million related to our glycerine refining plant in the united kingdom 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to due diligence costs of million incurred in related to a potential acquisition which was not consummated 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to lower average borrowings on revolving credit facilities and term debt 
lower average borrowings resulted from debt reductions funded by cash flows from operations and the net proceeds from the sale of monessen in october income taxes for the year ended december  were million higher when compared to the prior year period due primarily to the increase in pretax income of million and estimated taxes on unremitted european earnings for for the year ended december   all european earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested and did not attract us taxation 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was percent as compared to the prior year period of percent 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the us taxation of european earnings in gain on sale of monessen for the year ended december  represents the gain  net of tax expense  from the sale of our percent interest in monessen to arcelormittal sa on october  effective as of this date  monessen was classified as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations

on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of cents per common share  payable on april  to shareholders of record as of february  liquidity and capital resources restrictions on dividends to koppers holdings koppers holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of koppers inc and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations  including payments of principal  interest and other amounts on the percent senior discount notes due the senior discount notes 
the terms of koppers inc s revolving credit facility as well as the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes significantly restrict koppers inc from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to koppers holdings 
the amount of permitted dividends under both debt facilities is governed by a formula based on percent of consolidated net income  among other things 
cash equity contributions from the sale of koppers holdings common stock increase the amount available for dividends 
at the time of the payment of the dividend  no event of default shall have occurred or be continuing under the indenture or the revolving credit facility 
under the indenture relating to the senior secured notes  koppers inc must have an ebitda as defined in the indenture to consolidated interest expense ratio of at least to additionally  the revolving credit facility requires compliance with all financial covenants and availability of at least million and leverage ratio less than times under the revolving credit facility after giving effect to any proposed dividend 
significant reductions in net income  or increases to indebtedness affecting compliance with financial covenants or availability under the revolving credit facility would restrict koppers inc s ability to pay dividends

as of december   dividends available to be declared based on covenant restrictions under the senior secured notes amounted to million 
liquidity the koppers inc revolving credit facility agreement  as amended and restated  provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million at variable rates 
the revolving credit facility replaced the senior secured revolving credit facility on october  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of koppers inc s assets  including the assets of certain significant subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains certain covenants that limit capital expenditures by koppers inc and restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on its assets  enter into leases  pay dividends and make investments or acquisitions 
in addition  such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by koppers inc to meet certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company had million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments 
as of december   million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit 
the following table summarizes koppers estimated liquidity as of december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents amount available under revolving credit facility amount available under other credit facilities total estimated liquidity our estimated liquidity was million at december  the increase in estimated liquidity from that date is due primarily to an increase in availability under the new revolving credit facility and the increase in cash as a result of the monessen transaction 

table of contents as of december   we had million aggregate amount of common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants or a combination of these securities available to be issued under our registration statement on form s filed in in february  our board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program 
this program allows for the repurchase of up to million of common stock from time to time in the open market 
the program is scheduled to expire in february the timing of such purchases will be determined by us based on a number of factors including the market price of our common stock  the availability and pursuit of strategic initiatives including investment and acquisition opportunities  operating cash flow and internal capital requirements  and general economic conditions 
during  the company repurchased million of common stock under the program 
our need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service  purchase commitments and operating leases  as well as for working capital  capital maintenance programs and mandatory defined benefit plan funding 
we may also use cash to pursue potential strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures in  excluding acquisitions  are expected to total approximately million 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that the foregoing sources are not sufficient to fund our expenditures and service our indebtedness  we would be required to raise additional funds 
cash flows from discontinued operations the cash flows related to monessen and koppers arch for the three years ended december  have not been restated in the consolidated statement of cash flows

with respect to the monessen sale  in february the acquirer filed a notice of objection in connection with the determination of certain assumed liabilities and has requested an adjustment to the purchase price of approximately million 
based upon the nature of the objections cited by the acquirer  at this time  we do not believe that the purchase price should be adjusted and accordingly  we have not provided for any adjustment to the purchase price as of december  in connection with the sale of our percent interest in koppers arch  we have provided an indemnity to the buyer for our share of liabilities  if any  arising from certain litigation and claims existing at july  our financial exposure pursuant to this indemnity is capped at a monetary limit and is subject to time limitations

recently issued accounting guidance the information related to recently issued accounting guidance set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements is hereby incorporated by reference 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
our management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or when title passes to the customer 
we recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon transfer of title  which occurs upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer 
service revenue  consisting primarily of wood treating services  is recognized at the time the service is provided 
our recognition of revenue with respect to untreated crossties meets all the recognition criteria of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin topic a  including transfer of title and risk of ownership  the existence of fixed purchase commitments and delivery schedules established by the customer and the completion of all performance obligations by us 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
in the united states  cm c and r up inventories are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the last in  first out lifo basis  or market 
inventories outside the united states are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the first in  first out basis fifo  or market 
market represents replacement cost for raw materials and net realizable value for work in process and finished goods 
lifo inventories constituted approximately percent and percent of the fifo inventory value at december  and  respectively 
long lived assets 
our management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  based on a number of factors including operating results  projected future cash flows and business plans 
we record long lived assets at the lower of cost or fair value  with fair value based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of fixed assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
in making this assessment  management relies on various factors  including operating results  estimated future cash flows  and business plans 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
because management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated 
goodwill valuations are performed using an average of actual and projected operating results of the relevant reporting units 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
additionally  disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
at december  our balance sheet included million of deferred tax assets 
we have determined that a valuation allowance of million is required for these deferred tax assets  based on future earnings 
table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report projections 
to the extent that we encounter unexpected difficulties in market conditions  adverse changes in regulations affecting our businesses and operations  adverse outcomes in legal and environmental matters  or any other unfavorable conditions  the projections for future taxable income may be overstated and we may be required to record an increase in the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on income in the future 
accrued insurance 
we are insured for property  casualty and workers compensation insurance up to various stop loss amounts after meeting required retention levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the liability for the related retentions for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience 
in the event we incur a significant number of losses beyond the coverage retention limits  additional expense beyond the actuarial projections would be required 
asset retirement obligations 
we measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance  using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks 
in the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates  we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues 
pension and postretirement benefits 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided far into the future and allocating that cost over the time period each employee works 
this calculation requires extensive use of assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns  mortality  medical costs  employee turnover and discount rates 
in determining the expected return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate long term actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and estimates of future investment returns 
in selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions  we take into consideration a number of factors including our actual health care cost increases  the design of our benefit programs  the characteristics of our active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates 
because these items require our management s judgment  the related liabilities currently recorded by us could be lower or higher than amounts ultimately required to be paid 
litigation contingencies 
we record liabilities related to legal matters when an adverse outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
to the extent we anticipate favorable outcomes to these matters which ultimately result in adverse outcomes  we could incur material adverse impacts on earnings and cash flows 
because such matters require significant judgments on the part of management  the recorded liabilities could be lower than what is ultimately required 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including  among other things  the cleanup of contaminated sites  the treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  the discharge of effluent into waterways  the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters 
we expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations 
we may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third party claims  or otherwise incur costs  relating to cleanup of  or for injuries resulting from  contamination at sites associated with past and present operations 
we accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage the interest rate risks  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
this reduces the impact of short term fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  we enter into foreign currency debt instruments that are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating currencies on net income and equity 
we also use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments up to twelve months and all such contracts are marked to market with the recognition of a gain or loss at each reporting period 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our financial instruments and foreign operations to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates as if these changes occurred at december  and the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate and exchange 
table of contents rate assumptions 
these forward looking statements are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments and foreign operations 
they do not include other potential effects that could impact our business as a result of these changes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have both fixed and variable rate debt to manage interest rate risk and to minimize borrowing costs 
in january  we also entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with respect to notional million of the senior secured notes 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the fair market value of the interest rate swap was an asset of million at december  at december  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt  and at december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt for both years  including the swap 
our ratio of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at december   including the interest rate swap referred to above  was approximately percent  reflecting a decrease in the ratio from percent in the previous period due to the decrease in variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels and foreign exchange rates  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december  and would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
the earnings and cash flows for the next year assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease approximately million  holding other variables constant 
with respect to the interest rate swap  a ten percent decrease in interest rates at december  would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the interest rate swap by approximately million to an asset of million 
a ten percent increase in interest rates at december  would have decreased the unrealized fair market value of the interest rate swap by approximately million to an asset of million 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis 
our exchange rate exposures result primarily from our investment and ongoing operations in australia  denmark  china and the united kingdom 
holding other variables constant  if there were a ten percent reduction in all relevant exchange rates  the effect on our earnings  based on actual earnings from foreign operations for the years ended december  and  would be reductions of approximately million and million  respectively
