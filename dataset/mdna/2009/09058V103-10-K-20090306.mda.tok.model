risk factors 
overview corporate highlights forodesine hcl following the completion of a phase i ii clinical trial of forodesine hcl in patients with refractory ctcl  in october we initiated a planned pivotal trial with an oral formulation of forodesine hcl for treatment of patients with ctcl 
this trial is being conducted under an spa agreement negotiated with the fda and will serve as a basis for a new drug application to the fda using the oral formulations in patients with relapsed ctcl 
in february  we announced that the committee for orphan medicinal products of the european medicines agency had granted orphan drug designation to forodesine hcl for the treatment of ctcl 
the trial continues to enroll subjects with ctcl stages iib through iva who have failed three systemic therapies 
enrollment in the study slowed over the summer of below our projections 
we have taken action to accelerate enrollment and early indications are that these actions are having a positive effect 
we have enrolled more than half of the targeted patients in this study and will continue to monitor enrollment going forward 
at the december meeting of the american society of hematology ash  madeline duvic  md  deputy chair  dermatology  the university of texas md anderson cancer center  presented interim data from the phase i ii clinical study of oral forodesine hcl in the treatment of subjects with refractory ctcl 
the overall response rate for these subjects was  including subjects with complete response and subjects with partial response 
these data indicated that in addition to a good safety profile  forodesine hcl demonstrated clinical activity as a single oral agent in patients with advanced refractory ctcl 
in december  we announced interim data from the ongoing forodesine hcl phase ii program in patients with cll and data from a healthy subject pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study 
the cll study will continue with an amendment to study a new dosing regimen of oral forodesine  mg twice daily 
an interim analysis was conducted on data from an exploratory phase ii single arm  open label program in patients with cll whose previous treatment had failed 
while this analysis showed that no partial or complete responses were observed  five out of patients administered mg of forodesine hcl once daily had substantial reductions in malignant lymphocytes  and at the time of the analysis  seven patients were still on study 
forodesine hcl was generally safe and well tolerated at the mg once daily dose 
in a parallel  healthy subject  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study  we compared the effect of seven days of mg forodesine hcl dosed once daily with seven days of mg forodesine hcl dosed twice daily 
the study demonstrated substantially increased drug exposure and pharmacodynamic effect in subjects administered forodesine hcl mg twice daily 
drug exposure  as measured by area under the plasma concentration time curve auc  increased by percent p for twice daily dosing compared to once daily dosing 
serum uric acid levels were reduced at steady state compared to baseline by percent for twice daily dosing compared to percent for once daily dosing p  indicating increased pnp enzyme inhibition with twice daily dosing 

table of contents in january  we initiated a phase iib multicenter  open label  non randomized repeat dose registration study to evaluate an intravenous treatment of forodesine hcl followed by an oral treatment of forodesine hcl in patients with relapsed or refractory t all 
this study was being conducted under an spa negotiated with the fda and was designed to determine the rate of complete remission achieved with forodesine hcl 
in march  we announced that as a result of a stability issue with the iv formulation  that we were voluntarily placing this phase iib clinical trial on hold pending internal review and discussions with the our partner  mundipharma 
in december  we announced the formal termination of this study 
peramivir in january  we announced that hhs had awarded the company a million  four year contract for the advanced development of peramivir 
in january  we announced that the development plan for peramivir had changed and that we would no longer pursue the phase iii im program in peramivir for the current influenza season  but would move forward in evaluating higher doses than used in previous studies 
also in january  we announced that the program would cost in excess of the million contract and that any funding above the million may be the responsibility of the company 
since then  hhs and the company have been working in collaboration through various contract modifications to maximize resources by stopping work on some projects eg the phase iii eg program and capping expenditures on other projects in order to maximize remaining funds 
hhs and the company executed a contract modification that fully funds the company through the completion of both the phase ii studies in outpatients treated with intramuscular peramivir  the phase ii study in hospitalized patients with intravenous peramivir  and certain manufacturing and toxicology components of the program 
the modification also allows the company and hhs to agree on additional development activities for peramivir within the confirmed million funding 
all temporary restraints  effected through a stop work order  have now been removed 
following completion of the phase ii studies  we expect to continue the dialogue with hhs regarding additional funding beyond the million for peramivir development through us licensure 
the original contract of million and the four year term remain unchanged 
in addition to the contract with hhs  in february  we established a collaborative relationship with shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in japan 
we received an upfront payment of million and the agreement provided for additional future clinical event milestone payments of up to million 
shionogi recently completed a phase ii study of intravenous iv peramivir administered via a single dose infusion in the outpatient setting for treatment of seasonal influenza 
this trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects with confirmed  acute  uncomplicated influenza infection  compared to placebo alone 
time to alleviation of symptoms was hours for placebo  hours for mg peramivir  and hours for mg peramivir 
this result was highly statistically significant p for both the mg dose p and the mg dose 
further  safety assessments confirmed that iv peramivir was generally safe and well tolerated 
shionogi presented the data at the recent interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy icaac infectious diseases society of america idsa annual meeting in washington  dc based on the results from this phase ii study  shionogi has initiated a phase iii program with iv peramivir in the outpatient setting 
the phase iii study is a  subject study and would typically require two seasons to complete 
in the event of a very strong flu season it is possible to complete a study of this magnitude in one flu season 
although it has been a strong flu season in asia  it is not clear at this time if shionogi will finish in one season or two 
it is our understanding that shionogi plans to complete its studies within this influenza season 
in october  the company and shionogi amended the license agreement to expand the territory in the agreement to include taiwan and to provide rights for shionogi to perform a phase iii clinical trial in hong kong 
intramuscular peramivir 
we completed a double blind placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial with im peramivir testing two different dose levels of peramivir mg and mg versus placebo in adults with acute uncomplicated influenza 
while the trial did not demonstrate statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms  the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that peramivir demonstrated statistically significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both peramivir treatment groups compared to placebo  with greater reductions in the mg dose group 
with this information and the additional pharmacokinetic information we have obtained subsequent to the trial  we initiated a phase ii placebo controlled trial of mg im peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza 
this trial uses a new  more concentrated mg ml formulation of peramivir 
this trial is ongoing in the northern hemisphere and we expect results sometime in the second quarter of 
table of contents intravenous peramivir in july  we announced the initiation of a phase ii clinical trial of iv peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of iv peramivir to orally administered oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to acute influenza 
the primary objective of the study was to evaluate time to clinical stability  which is a composite endpoint comprised of normalization of temperature  oxygen saturation  respiratory rate  systolic blood pressure and heart rate 
this type of endpoint has previously been used in pneumonia studies  but not in influenza 
secondary objectives of the study included evaluation of viral shedding  mortality  clinical relapse and time to resumption of usual activities 
the multicenter  randomized  double blind  double dummy  active controlled  phase ii study enrolled patients  who tested positive by rapid antigen test rat for influenza and had one or more criteria for hospitalization  namely age years  chronic lung disease  congestive heart failure  diabetes mellitus  low oxygen saturation  low blood pressure  or severity of illness requiring supportive care 
of the patients randomized  age to years had influenza confirmed by polymerase chain reaction pcr testing and were included in the intent to treat infected itti patient population  patients received oseltamivir mg orally twice daily  patients received mg iv peramivir once daily and patients received mg iv peramivir once daily 
as reported in october  there were no statistically significant differences in any of the efficacy endpoints between the three treatment arms  and peramivir was generally safe and well tolerated at those dose levels 
evaluation of time to clinical stability  the primary endpoint  showed a median of hours for peramivir mg  hours for peramivir mg and hours for oseltamivir p 
this exploratory endpoint was driven by resolution of fever 
viral shedding time weighted change from baseline in viral titer was reduced by a median of logs for peramivir mg  logs for peramivir mg  and logs for oseltamivir p 
there was no mortality in the primary efficacy population  and there were no clinical relapses 
patients were discharged from the hospital after a median of days for peramivir mg   days for peramivir mg  and days for oseltamivir p 
the median number of days required for resumption of usual activities was days for peramivir mg  days for peramivir mg  and days for oseltamivir p 
the company presented the results at the xi international symposium on respiratory viral infection being held in bangkok  thailand in february bcx r during the third quarter of  we announced that roche had initiated a phase iia clinical trial to evaluate oral doses of bcx r in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
the efficacy assessment of the study has been completed 
consistent with interim findings reported by the company in may  the phase ii clinical study of bcx  a potent  rationally designed  orally available pnp inhibitor  met its primary objectives of safety and tolerability 
in addition  bcx displayed dose dependent reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts  including subsets measuring b cells cd  total t cells cd  t helper cells cd and t suppressor cytotoxic cells cd 
further  plasma levels of bcx increased with dose  and plasma uric acid levels showed dose related reductions with bcx in addition  consistent with interim results previously reported by the company  no evidence of clinical efficacy  a secondary objective  was observed in psoriasis patients with doses and duration of administration tested 
in the phase iia trial  bcx was generally safe and well tolerated at doses up to mg daily for six weeks 
most adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate  and low in frequency 
no opportunistic infections were observed 
in addition  detailed laboratory and clinical monitoring did not indicate any patterns suggestive of off target adverse findings 
also in may  we announced that we received notice that roche was exercising the no cause termination right under the license agreement for bcx as a result  we regained worldwide rights to bcx results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was partially driven by a reduction of million in revenue from the contract with hhs for the development of peramivir  which includes the establishment of a million reserve recorded by the company during the second quarter of for amounts 
table of contents that were previously expected to be received from hhs related to costs incurred in the phase iii program of intramuscular im peramivir for outpatient influenza 
the company initiated this program and voluntarily discontinued it following a decision to pursue higher doses in the ongoing phase ii study 
reimbursement of these costs is under discussion with hhs 
further contributing to the decrease in collaborative and other r d revenues from to was the prior year receipt of a million milestone payment from shionogi 
this was offset by the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue related to the termination of the company s collaboration with roche in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in r d expenses was due to a reduction in the clinical development costs of million and toxicology costs of million associated with the peramivir program  a reduction in manufacturing costs of million and million associated with the peramivir and forodesine hcl programs  respectively  and a reduction in costs incurred on the company s pre clinical compounds of million 
these reductions were offset by an increase in the company s clinical development costs of million for forodesine hcl  the recognition of million of previously deferred expense related to the termination of the company s collaboration with roche  and increases of million in personnel related costs  consulting fees  and operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the higher expenses were primarily due to increases in professional fees and operating costs 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue was million for the year compared to million for the increase for was primarily due to revenue from hhs related to our contract for the development of peramivir 
in addition  we received a million milestone payment from shionogi in december for their initiation of a phase ii clinical trial  and there was an increase of million in amortization of deferred revenue compared to on the continuing amortization of the upfront payments from the roche  shionogi and mundipharma agreements 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease of million in reimbursement from mundipharma for our clinical trial costs compared to research and development expenses for were million  a increase from expenses of million  primarily attributable to the clinical and manufacturing costs of our expanded peramivir and forodesine hcl programs  increases in personnel and related costs to support the advanced development of our pipeline  and increases in consulting and toxicology 
included in r d expenses for is approximately million of pre contract costs directly related to the phase ii trials for both the iv and iv peramivir products 
these costs were incurred during in anticipation of a contract award from hhs and were required to meet the delivery schedule of the proposed contract 
in accordance with the provisions of federal acquisition regulation  the costs were included in the company s request for proposal and were eligible for reimbursement from hhs 
the million of costs incurred prior to the contract award date were deferred and included in other current assets on the company s balance sheet at december  in the first quarter of  the million in costs were billed and expensed 
concurrently  revenue was recognized for these costs plus the applicable fixed fee 
general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of over the expense of million  primarily due to additional compensation  which also included an increase of million non cash share based compensation charge related to statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement no 
r 
in addition  there was an increase in professional fees  including legal  which were partially offset by an increase in costs allocated to r d 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in liquidity and capital resources 
table of contents cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity and debt securities and cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements  including government contracts  and to a lesser extent interest 
for example  during  we received cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements and government contracts primarily hhs  mundipharma  and shionogi  of approximately million and on august   we announced the closing of a million private placement of common stock to certain existing stockholders 
as of december   we have approximately million due from our collaborators  primarily hhs 
other sources of funding have included the following other collaborative and other research and development agreements  government grants and contracts  equipment lease financing  facility leases  research grants  and interest income 
in addition  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities  undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of compounds which have been or may be discovered and as we increase the manufacturing of our compounds for clinical trials and for the continuation of the validation process 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of development 
we invest our excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature within two years 
we have not realized any significant losses from such investments 
on august   we amended our lease for our current birmingham facilities  consisting of  square feet  through june  we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years at the current market rate in effect on june  the lease requires us to pay monthly rent currently at  per month in december and escalates annually to a minimum of  per month in the final year  plus our pro rata share of operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of base year amounts 
in addition  the most recent lease amendment provided an allowance of  for our use in making certain improvements to the premises 
in august  we opened an office in cary  north carolina for the establishment of our clinical and regulatory operation 
we currently have  square feet under lease through february  this lease currently requires us to pay  per month and escalates annually to  per month in the final year 
during  we incurred capital costs of approximately million  while we incurred capital costs of approximately million in included in capital costs were amounts related to a renovation of our facility to build additional laboratory space 
the cost of this expansion was partially funded by a  tenant allowance in our lease amendment 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of  in   in  and  in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following 
table of contents payments under our contract with hhs  our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and lease or loan financing and future public or private financing 
in march  we announced a collaborative agreement with shionogi for rights to peramivir in japan 
this agreement required an upfront payment of million that was received in april in december  we received a million milestone payment from shionogi for their initiation of a phase ii clinical trial with iv peramivir 
in october  the company and shionogi amended the license agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include taiwan and to provide rights for shionogi to perform a phase iii clinical trial in hong kong 
shionogi initiated a phase iii study in december in january  we announced that hhs had awarded the company a million  four year contract for the advanced development of peramivir 
the contract is a standard cost plus fixed fee contract  which we expect will continue to have a significant positive impact on our financial position and cash flow 
we bill our incurred costs to hhs on a monthly basis 
any significant delays in payment  rejection of significant costs by hhs or cancellation of this contract by hhs would have a significant negative effect on our financial position 
in january  we announced that the development plan for peramivir had changed and that we would no longer pursue the phase iii im program in peramivir for the current influenza season  but would move forward in evaluating higher doses than used in previous studies 
also in january  we announced that the program would cost in excess of the million contract and that any funding above the million may be the responsibility of the company 
since then  hhs and the company have been working in collaboration through various contract modifications to maximize resources by stopping work on some projects eg the phase iii eg program and capping expenditures on other projects in order to maximize remaining funds 
hhs and the company executed a contract modification that fully funds the company through the completion of both the phase ii studies in outpatients treated with intramuscular peramivir  the phase ii study in hospitalized patients with intravenous peramivir  and certain manufacturing and toxicology components of the program 
the modification also allows the company and hhs to agree on additional development activities for peramivir within the confirmed million funding 
all temporary restraints  effected through a stop work order  have now been removed 
following completion of the phase ii studies  we expect to continue the dialogue with hhs regarding additional funding beyond the million for peramivir development through us licensure 
the original contract of million and the four year term remain unchanged 
in february  we licensed forodesine hcl to mundipharma for the development and commercialization of this drug in europe  asia and australasia 
in addition to the upfront payment of million  which was received in february  mundipharma is paying of the clinical development costs we are incurring for forodesine hcl on existing and planned clinical trials  but their portion shall not exceed million 
in addition  mundipharma will conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of million 
the agreement also provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by mundipharma upon the achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and sales events 
in january  we initiated our pivotal study with forodesine hcl in t cell leukemia patients under an spa negotiated with the fda  which triggered a million event payment from mundipharma 
subsequently  in march  the company made a decision to put this trial on voluntary hold to investigate particulates that were found in some batches of iv formulation 
in december  we announced the termination of our development in t all with forodesine hcl 
in july  we announced the company had received an spa for a pivotal trial of forodesine hcl in ctcl patients 
the trial is a multicenter  multinational  open label  single arm  repeat dose pivotal trial which began enrollment during october the trial continues to enroll subjects with ctcl stages iib through iva who have failed three systemic therapies 
enrollment in the study slowed over the summer of below our projections 
we have taken action to accelerate enrollment and early indications are that these actions are having a positive effect 
we will continue to monitor enrollment going forward 
the collaboration with roche for the worldwide development and commercialization of bcx in november provided an upfront payment of million  which was received in in may  we announced that we 
table of contents received notice that roche was exercising the no cause termination right under the license agreement for bcx as a result  we regained worldwide rights to bcx for the year  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance has decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  this decrease was primarily due to cash used for operations  partially offset by reimbursement from collaborators 
as a result  our net cash burn rate for was approximately million per month 
we caution that our revenues  our expenses  and our cash flows will vary significantly from quarter to quarter throughout due to the nature of the trials in influenza and the reimbursement from hhs 
we are projecting our net cash use to be to million  dependent on the achievement of certain milestones 
our actual burn rate could vary significantly from the projection above depending on the timing of company expenses and the related reimbursement from our collaborators 
as our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases  our costs will increase 
our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development  manufacturing  regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses 
our expenses  revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates  the amount and timing of funding we receive from hhs for peramivir  the amount of funding or assistance  if any  we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products  the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
with our currently available funds and the amounts to be received from hhs  shionogi and our other collaborators  we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including our ability to perform under the contract with hhs and receive reimbursement  the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships or government contracts  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  the extent to which our partners  including governmental agencies will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for certain drug candidates  or a decision to build or expand internal development and commercial capabilities  successful commercialization of marketed products by either us or a partner  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and evaluate drug candidates  our ability to engage sites and enroll subjects in our clinical trials  the scope of manufacturing of our drug candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  increases in personnel and related costs to support the development of our drug candidates  
table of contents the scope of manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the costs involved in all aspects of intellectual property strategy and protection including the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including governmental agencies in general and from the hhs contract specifically  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe or off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other significant purchase commitments 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying 
table of contents value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues have generally been limited to license fees  event payments  research and development fees  government contracts  and interest income 
revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf issue 
license fees  event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
for example  in the mundipharma license agreement  we deferred the upfront payment over the remaining life of the patent  which is in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in accordance with eitf issue revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
under the guidance of eitf emerging issues task force issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent and emerging issues task force issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses  reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
for example  the amounts received from our collaboration with mundipharma for the reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs received from hhs for reimbursement will be recorded as revenue in the period the related costs were recorded 
event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
if royalties can not be reasonably estimated  revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
we have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed pharmaceutical products 
research and development expenses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs  we expense research and development costs as incurred 
prior to january   we also expensed nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services received in connection with research and development activities 
effective january   we adopted the consensus in emerging issues task force issue  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services received for use in future research and development activities eitf issue 
eitf requires that these payments be deferred and recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
we applied the new guidance to all advance payments made during for contracts executed after the effective date of this consensus 

table of contents research and development expenses include  among other items  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by contract research organizations cro s  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cro s 
costs for studies performed by cro s are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of services actually performed 
additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom  irl  and uab  which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees 
we expense sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred  in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
we expense maintenance payments as incurred 
our accounting for deferred sublicense payments related to revenues that have been deferred is based on the guidance in sab no 
 which states that the incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a contract in a transaction that results in the deferral of revenue may either be expensed as incurred or accounted for in accordance with paragraph of financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance costs ftb 
sublicense payments are paid to our academic partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial partners 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments from our commercial partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 
we group our r d expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by program 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
the following table summarizes our r d expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  direct external r d expenses by program pnp inhibitor forodesine hcl pnp inhibitor bcx neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir hepatitis c polymerase inhibitor other all other r d expenses compensation and fringe benefits supplies and services maintenance  depreciation  and amortization overhead allocation and other total r d expenses at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of our various product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate s commercial potential 
as such  we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our product

in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates  which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda  or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  as updated from time to time in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the sec 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are unavailable 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation at december   we have two stock based employee compensation plans  the stock incentive plan and the employee stock purchase plan 
prior to january   we accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and other related interpretations  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement no 

no stock based compensation cost related to our employees 
table of contents was recognized in the statements of operations for any period ending prior to january   as all options granted to our employees had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
under the fair value recognition provisions of statement no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
consistent with the valuation method we used for disclosure only purposes under the provisions of statement no 
 we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value under statement no 
r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment  including estimating the life of an award  the stock price volatility  and the expected term 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest our excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to market risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided
