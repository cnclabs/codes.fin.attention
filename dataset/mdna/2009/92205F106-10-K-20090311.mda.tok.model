item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  forecasts  guidance  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas  production volumes  estimates of proved reserves  capital expenditures  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in item a risk factors and forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature  long lived natural gas and oil properties in the united states 
our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and over time to increase our quarterly cash distributions through the acquisition of new natural gas and oil properties 
as of december   our properties are located in the southern portion of the appalachian basin  primarily in southeast kentucky and northeast tennessee  the permian basin  primarily in west texas and southeastern new mexico  and in south texas 
at december   we owned working interests in  gross net productive wells 
in addition to these productive wells  we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells 
as of december   we had a working interest in approximately  gross undeveloped acres surrounding or adjacent to our existing wells located in the appalachian basin 
in south texas  we own working interests ranging from in approximately  undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells 
approximately or bcfe of our estimated proved reserves were attributable to our working interests in undeveloped acreage 
initial public offering in october  we completed our ipo of million units representing limited liability interests in vnr at per unit for net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and fees of million 
in addition  we incurred offering costs of million in connection with the ipo 
the proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness under our reserve based credit facility by million and the balance was used for the payment of accrued distributions to pre ipo unitholders and the payment of a deferred swap obligation 
permian basin acquisition on december   we entered in to a purchase and sale agreement with the apache corporation for the purchase of certain natural gas and oil properties located in ten separate fields in the permian basin of west texas and southeastern new mexico 
the 
table of contents purchase price for said assets was million with an effective date of october  we completed this acquisition on january  for an adjusted purchase price of million  subject to customary post closing adjustments 
the post closing adjustments reduced the final purchase price to million and included a purchase price adjustment of million for the cash flow from the acquired properties for the period between the effective date  october   and the final settlement date 
this acquisition was funded with borrowings under our reserve based credit facility 
through this acquisition  we acquired working interests in gross wells net wells  of which we operate 
with respect to operations  we have established two district offices  one in lovington  new mexico and the other in christoval  texas to manage these assets 
our operating focus will be on maximizing existing production and looking for complementary acquisitions that we can add to this operating platform 
with this acquisition  based on internal reserve estimates  we acquired million barrels of oil equivalent  of which is oil and of which is proved developed producing 
south texas acquisition on july   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with segundo navarro drilling  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of the lewis energy group  for the acquisition of certain natural gas and oil properties located in the dos hermanos field in webb county  texas 
the purchase price for said assets was million with an effective date of june  we completed this acquisition on july  for an adjusted purchase price of million  subject to customary post closing adjustments to be determined 
this acquisition was funded with million of borrowings under our reserve based credit facility and through the issuance of  common units of the company 
in this purchase  we acquired an average of a working interest in producing wells and an average working interest in approximately  gross acres with identified proved undeveloped locations 
an affiliate of lewis energy group operates all the properties and is contractually obligated to drill seven wells each year from through unless mutually agreed not to do so 
based on internal reserve estimates  we acquired bcfe of proved reserves  of which is natural gas and of which is proved developed producing 
upon closing this transaction  we assumed natural gas swaps and collars based on houston ship channel pricing for approximately of the estimated gas production from existing producing wells for the period beginning july through december which had a fair value of million on july  our relationship with vinland on april  but effective as of january   we entered into various agreements with vinland  under which we rely on vinland to operate our existing producing wells in appalachia and coordinate our development drilling program in appalachia 
we expect to benefit from the substantial development and operational expertise of vinland management in the appalachian basin 
under a management services agreement  vinland advises and consults with us regarding all aspects of our production and development operations in appalachia and provides us with administrative support services as necessary for the operation of our business 
in addition  vinland may  but does not have any obligation to  provide us with acquisition services under the management services agreement 
while vinland is not obligated to provide us with acquisition services  we expect that due to significant common ownership vinland has an incentive to grow our business by helping us to identify  evaluate and complete acquisitions that will be accretive to our distributable cash 
in addition  under a gathering and compression agreement that we entered into with vinland energy gathering  llc veg  veg gathers  compresses  delivers and provides the services necessary for us to market our natural gas production in the area of mutual interest  or ami 
veg will deliver our natural gas production to certain designated interconnects with third party transporters 
since the various agreements were executed on april  but were effective as of january   vinland reimbursed us for the drilling costs and expenses that we incurred on their behalf associated with their interest in the wells drilled between january  and april  in addition  vinland reimbursed us for selling  general and administrative expenses that we incurred on their behalf between january  and april  we reimbursed vinland for certain transaction costs and expenses relating to entering into these agreements 
restructuring plan prior to the separation  our predecessor owned all of the assets in appalachia that are currently owned by us and vinland 
as part of the separation of our operating company and vinland  effective january   we conveyed to vinland of our predecessor s working interest in the known producing horizons in approximately  gross undeveloped acres in the ami  of our predecessor s interest in an additional  undeveloped acres and certain coalbed methane rights located in the appalachian basin  the rights to any natural gas and oil located on our acreage at depths above and feet below our known producing horizons  all of our gathering and compression assets and all employees except  our president and chief executive officer and our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
we retained all of our predecessor s proved producing wells and associated reserves 
we also retained of our predecessor s working interest in the known producing horizons in approximately  gross undeveloped acres in the ami and a contract right to receive approximately of the net proceeds  after deducting royalties paid to other parties  severance taxes  third party transportation costs  costs incurred in the operation of wells and overhead costs  from the sale of production from certain producing natural gas and oil wells  which accounted for approximately of our estimated proved reserves as of december  in addition  we changed the name of our operating company from nami holding company  llc to vanguard natural gas  llc 
collectively  we refer to these events as the restructuring 

table of contents private offering in april  we completed a private equity offering pursuant to which we issued  units to certain private investors  which we collectively refer to as the private investors  for million 
we used the net proceeds of this private equity offering to make a distribution to majeed s 
nami  vnr s largest unitholder  who used a portion of these funds to capitalize vinland and also paid us million to reduce outstanding accounts receivable from vinland 
we then used the million to repay borrowings and interest under our reserve based credit facility  and for general limited liability company purposes 
under the terms of the private offering  all outstanding units accrued distributions at annually from the closing of the private offering to september  and then distributions payable to the private investors only increased to until the completion of the ipo at which time all accrued distributions totaling million were paid 
reserve based credit facility on january   we entered into a reserve based credit facility which is available for our general limited liability company purposes  including  without limitation  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our obligations under the reserve based credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
our initial borrowing base under the reserve based credit facility was set at million 
however  the borrowing base was subject to million reductions per month starting on july  through november   which resulted in a borrowing base of million as reaffirmed in november pursuant to a semi annual borrowing base redetermination 
we applied million of our net proceeds from our ipo in october to reduce our indebtedness under our reserve based credit facility 
in february  our reserve based credit facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity from january  to march   increase the maximum facility amount from million to million  increase our borrowing base from million to million and add two additional financial institutions as lenders  wachovia bank  na and the bank of nova scotia 
in october  our borrowing base was set at million 
our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for april utilizing our december  reserve report 
as a result of lower commodity prices  it is likely that we will be subject to a decrease in our borrowing base at our april redetermination 
until the redetermination occurs  the amount of the potential reduction is uncertain but based on preliminary discussions with our lead bank the expected reduction would not be material to the borrowing base as a whole and would not inhibit our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
additional borrowings under our reserve based credit facility were made in january pursuant to the acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the permian basin  and in july an additional million was borrowed to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid in the south texas acquisition 
in may  our reserve based credit facility was amended in response to a potential acquisition that ultimately did not occur 
as a result  none of the provisions included in this amendment went into effect 
in october  we amended our reserve based credit facility which set our borrowing base under the facility at million pursuant to our semi annual redetermination and added a new lender  compass bank 
as a result  indebtedness under the reserve based credit facility totaled million at december  and the applicable margins and the utilization percentages on our borrowing base utilization grid were changed to reflect the following borrowing base utilization grid borrowing base utilization percentage eurodollar loans abr loans commitment fee rate letter of credit fee in february  a third amendment was entered into which amended covenants to allow the company to repurchase up to million of our own units 
outlook our revenue  cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as access to capital  economic  political and regulatory developments  and competition from other sources of energy 
multiple events during involving numerous financial institutions have effectively restricted current liquidity within the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
despite efforts by treasury and banking regulators in the united states  europe and other nations around the world to provide liquidity to the financial sector  capital markets currently remain constrained 
we expect that our ability to raise debt and equity at prices that are similar to offerings in recent years to be limited as long as the capital markets remain constrained 

table of contents during  our unit price closed at a high of on may  and declined to a closing low of on december   which is the lowest our unit price has closed at since our initial public offering 
since that date our unit price has partially recovered to a level of on march  we intend to move forward with our development drilling program when market conditions allow for an adequate return on the drilling investment and only when we have sufficient liquidity to do so 
maintaining adequate liquidity may involve the issuance of debt and equity at less attractive terms  could involve the sale of non core assets  could require reductions in our capital spending  and could require a reduction in our distribution 
in the near term we will focus on maximizing returns on existing assets by managing our costs and selectively deploying capital to improve existing production 
natural gas and oil prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for natural gas or oil could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 
as required by our reserve based credit facility  we have mitigated this volatility for the years through by implementing a hedging program on a portion of our total anticipated production during this time frame 
we face the challenge of natural gas and oil production declines 
as a given well s initial reservoir pressures are depleted  natural gas and oil production decreases  thus reducing our total reserves 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline both by drilling on our properties and acquiring additional reserves 
we will maintain our focus on controlling costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions  as well as controlling the corresponding costs necessary to produce such reserves 
our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors  including the ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals and voluntary reductions in capital spending in a low commodity price environment 
any delays in drilling  completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact the rate of our production  which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and as a result  cash available for distribution 
in accordance with our business plan  we intend to invest the capital necessary to maintain our production at existing levels over the long term provided that it is economical to do so based on the commodity price environment 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to issue our debt and equity securities on favorable terms  or at all  and we may be unable to refinance our reserve based credit facility when it expires 
additionally  due to the significant decline in commodity prices  our borrowing base under our reserve based credit facility may be re determined such that it will not provide for the working capital necessary to fund our capital spending program and could affect our ability to make distributions 
comparability of our financial statements to our predecessor the historical financial statements of our predecessor included in this annual report on form k may not be comparable to our results of operations for the following reasons on april   but effective january   we conveyed to vinland of our predecessor s working interest in the known producing horizons in approximately  gross undeveloped acres in the ami  of our predecessor s interest in an additional  undeveloped acres and certain coalbed methane rights located in the appalachian basin  the rights to any natural gas and oil located on our acreage at depths above and feet below our known producing horizons and all of our gathering and compression assets 
in addition  all of the employees except  our president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer  were transferred to vinland 
on april   but effective january   we entered into a management services agreement and a gathering and compression agreement with vinland which fixed a portion of our production costs for wells owned in the area of mutual interest 
our predecessor did not account for its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under sfas accordingly  the changes in the fair value of its derivative instruments were reflected in earnings for all periods prior to and in other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  in  unrealized gains and losses were recorded in earnings as all commodity and interest rate derivative contracts were either de designated as cash flow hedges or they failed to meet the hedge documentation requirements for cash flow hedges

the increase in natural gas and oil sales was due primarily to the impact of the permian basin acquisition completed on january   the south texas acquisition completed on july  and increases in commodity prices during the first three quarters of production from the permian basin and south texas acquisitions contributed million of natural gas and oil sales for the year ended december  in appalachia  a decline in natural gas production was partially offset by a increase in oil production for a net production decline of on an mcfe basis 
the increase in oil production was primarily due to a greater focus on the completion of oil zones as prices increased which conversely affected the amount of natural gas produced 
however  the negative impact of the natural gas production decline was offset by a increase in the average realized natural gas sales price received excluding hedges and a increase in the average realized oil price excluding hedges 
hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   the company recognized million and million related to gains on commodity cash flow hedges and gains on other commodity derivative contracts  respectively 
these amounts relate to derivative contracts that the company entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production 
on november   the company concluded that since january  the contemporaneous formal documentation it had prepared to support its initial hedge designations and subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness in connection with the company s natural gas and oil hedging program in had not met the technical requirements to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas and it discontinued hedge accounting effective january  the gain on commodity cash flow hedges relates to the amount that settled in and has been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the gain on other commodity derivative contracts relates to the change in fair value of derivative contracts no longer accounted for under cash flow hedge accounting 
costs and expenses production costs consist of the lease operating expenses and production and other taxes severance and ad valorem taxes 
lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses in appalachia also include a per month per well administrative charge pursuant to a management services agreement with vinland  a per mcf and per mcf gathering and compression charge for production from wells drilled pre and post january   respectively  paid to vinland pursuant to a gathering and compression agreement with vinland 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year months ended december  of which million related to the permian basin and south texas acquisitions 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production and other taxes increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in of which million related to the permian basin and south texas acquisitions  and the remaining increase is attributable to higher severance taxes resulting from increased revenues in appalachia 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to the additional depletion recorded on the oil and gas properties acquired in the permian basin and south texas acquisitions 
an impairment of natural gas and oil properties in the amount of million was recognized during the year ended december  as the unamortized cost of natural gas and oil properties exceeded the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties as a result of a decline in natural gas and oil prices at the measurement date 
the impairment calculation did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allows the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and these expenses included a million and million non cash compensation charge related to the grant of restricted 
table of contents class b units to officers and an employee  the grant of unit options to management  and the grant of common units to board members during and the remaining increase of million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is principally due to incremental costs associated with being a public company 
interest expense declined to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower interest rates which more than offset the higher average outstanding debt for the year ended december  all of our predecessor s outstanding debt was repaid with borrowings under our reserve based credit facility in january  including an early prepayment penalty of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues natural gas and oil sales decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the key revenue measurements were as follows year ended december  percentage increase decrease vanguard vanguard predecessor total natural gas production mmcf average vanguard daily gas production mcf day average natural gas sales price per mcf net realized gas price  including hedges a net realized gas price  excluding hedges total oil production bbls average vanguard daily oil production bbls day average oil sales price per bbl  including and excluding hedges a excludes amortization of premiums paid and non cash settlements on derivative contracts 
the decrease in natural gas and oil sales was primarily due to the decrease in natural gas production and the decrease in oil production 
additionally  contributing to the decrease in natural gas and oil sales was the decrease in the average realized gas price during the year ended december  over december  however  the negative impact of the production decline was offset by a increase in the average realized oil price 
the decrease in production can be attributed to our drilling wells during the as compared to the predecessor drilling wells in the same period in hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   we hedged approximately of our natural gas production  which resulted in reported revenues that were approximately million lower than we would have achieved at unhedged prices 
however  the actual cash impact of the hedges increased realizations by million for the period after excluding the premiums paid on the settled derivatives 
in addition  in january  we terminated existing natural gas swaps at a cost of approximately million which resulted in an additional realized loss on derivative contracts of approximately million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our predecessor hedged approximately of our natural gas production  which resulted in revenues that were approximately million lower than our predecessor would have achieved at unhedged prices 
the derivative contracts entered into in were not specifically designated as hedges under sfas and therefore did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
as a result  the change in the fair value of these natural gas derivative contracts was marked to market in earnings each period in and resulted in a million non cash gain for the year ended december  costs and expenses 
table of contents production costs consist of the lease operating expenses and production and other taxes severance and ad valorem taxes 
lease operating expenses includes third party transportation costs  operating and maintenance costs associated with our gathering systems which were conveyed to vinland in connection with the restructuring and other customary charges 
as a result of the restructuring  lease operating expenses for the year ended december  includes third party transportation costs  a per month per well administrative charge pursuant to a management services agreement with vinland  a per mcf and per mcf gathering and compression charge for production from wells drilled pre and post january   respectively  paid to vinland pursuant to a gathering and compression agreement with vinland  as well as other customary charges 
lease operating expenses increased only slightly to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to amounts paid to vinland under the management services agreement and gathering and compression agreement being comparable to our actual costs incurred for the same period in on a per mcfe basis  lease operating expenses increased by to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state and county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production and other taxes increased million to million or on a per mcfe basis  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to a million underaccrual of severance taxes in  which was charged to expense in the first quarter of depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased million to million for the year ended december  despite the conveyance of certain assets to vinland pursuant to the restructuring effective january this result occurred due to the conveyance of long lived depreciable assets which generated little associated depreciation and the conveyed value of the interest in proved undeveloped properties which was largely offset by the cost of new wells drilled since december  in addition  the increase in depletion can be attributed to upward revisions of future drilling costs in the reserve report which increased the full cost pool to be depleted 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the cost of our employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs associated with being a public company not directly resulting from field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the impact of the restructuring which transferred all of the employees  except two of its officers to vinland 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  as compared to was offset by two principal factors 
first  our predecessor capitalized million of internal costs under the full cost method of accounting for natural gas and oil properties for the year ended december  whereas we have not capitalized any internal costs in  respectively 
second  the year ended december  includes a million non cash compensation charge related to the grant of class b units to management  an employee and a board member in april  august and october bad debt expense of approximately million was recorded during the year ended december  as a result of a provision for a loss on the entire amount due from a customer which filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in may the account receivable was due from oil sales through december at which time we ceased selling oil to the customer 
as the amount of any potential recovery is uncertain  we elected to reserve the entire balance 
we began selling our oil production to a new customer beginning march interest and financing expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in is primarily due to increased debt levels associated with drilling additional wells and rising interest rates 
in addition  our interest rates during were directly affected by the provision in our credit facility which increased our rates by on libor loans effective july  until we completed our ipo in october critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
please read note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 

table of contents full cost method of accounting for natural gas and oil properties the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred  where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to the full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of gas and oil properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged through income 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding natural gas and oil reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly related to these finding activities 
for the years ended december  and  there were no internal costs capitalized 
for the year ended december  such internal costs capitalized totaled million 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of natural gas and oil properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
our results of operations would have been different had we used the successful efforts method for our natural gas and oil investments 
generally  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts method of accounting 
full cost ceiling test at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of natural gas and oil properties is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  for which hedge accounting is applied  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties ceiling test 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development as more fully discussed in natural gas and oil reserve quantities below 
due to the imprecision in estimating natural gas and oil reserves as well as the potential volatility in natural gas and oil prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved natural gas and oil reserves  there can be no assurance that additional ceiling test write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved natural gas and oil properties 
these factors include declining natural gas and oil prices  downward revisions in estimated proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
we recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of natural gas and oil properties for the year ended december  of million as a result of a decline in natural gas and oil prices at the measurement date 
this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
no ceiling test impairment was required during or asset retirement obligation we have obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of a natural gas or oil well s life 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future plugging and abandonment costs requires management to make estimates and judgments inherent in the present value calculation of the future obligation 
these include ultimate plugging and abandonment costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and timing of the obligation 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the natural gas and oil property balance 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of natural gas and oil that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
nsai prepares a reserve and economic evaluation of all our properties on a well by well basis 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
we prepare our reserve estimates  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines 
the independent engineering 
table of contents firm described above adheres to the same guidelines when preparing their reserve reports 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil eventually recovered 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas and oil are recognized when natural gas and oil have been delivered to a custody transfer point  persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery  collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we sell natural gas and oil on a monthly basis 
virtually all of our contracts pricing provisions are tied to a market index  with certain adjustments based on  among other factors  whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line  quality of the natural gas or oil  and prevailing supply and demand conditions  so that the price of the natural gas and oil fluctuates to remain competitive with other available natural gas and oil supplies 
as a result  our revenues from the sale of natural gas will suffer if market prices decline and benefit if they increase without consideration of hedging 
we believe that the pricing provisions of our natural gas and oil contracts are customary in the industry 
gas imbalances occur when we sell more or less than our entitled ownership percentage of total gas production 
any amount received in excess of our share is treated as a liability 
if we receive less than our entitled share the underproduction is recorded as a receivable 
we did not have any significant gas imbalance positions at december  or price risk management activities we periodically use derivative financial instruments to achieve a more predictable cash flow from our natural gas and oil production by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations 
currently  these derivative financial instruments include fixed price swaps  collars and put options 
the derivative instruments we established in were designated as hedges under sfas in connection with preparing its quarterly report for third quarter and discussion with bdo seidman  llp  the company s new independent registered public accounting firm  management of the company and the audit committee of its board of directors concluded that the contemporaneous formal documentation it had prepared to support its initial hedge designations and subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness in connection with the company s natural gas and oil hedging program in did not meet the technical requirements to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas the primary reasons for this determination were that the formal hedge documentation lacked specificity of the hedged cash flow and the quantitative subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness were insufficient 
therefore  the cash flow designations failed to meet hedge documentation requirements for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
in addition  the natural gas derivative swap contracts entered into in were de designated as cash flow hedges in the first quarter of due to an overhedged position in natural gas which made them ineffective 
under sfas  the fair value of hedge contracts is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability  and the change in fair value of the hedge contracts are reflected in earnings 
if the hedge contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the fair value of the hedge contract is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  and changes in the fair value do not affect net income until the contract is settled 
if the hedge contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the change in the fair value of the hedge contract is reflected in earnings during the period as gain or loss on other commodity derivatives 
under the cash flow hedge accounting treatment used by the company in  the fair values of the hedge contracts were recognized in the consolidated balance sheets with the resulting unrealized gain or loss recorded initially in accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified through earnings when the hedged production affected earnings 
as a result of the determination that the documentation failed to meet cash flow hedge accounting treatment  the unrealized gain or loss on other commodity derivatives was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of revenues in in addition  the net derivative loss at december  related to the de designated natural gas derivative contracts entered into in is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income until the month in which the transactions settle 
our predecessor did not specifically designate the derivative instruments established in as hedges under sfas  even though they protected our predecessor from changes in commodity prices 
therefore  the mark to market of these instruments was recorded in current earnings as a component of total revenues 
further  these mark to market amounts represent non cash charges 
had no hedges been in place  our predecessor would have received additional revenue of million during in january  we terminated existing hedges at a cost of approximately million  of which million is reflected as a realized loss on commodity cash flow hedges on the statement of operations for the year ended december  stock based compensation 
table of contents we account for stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement and eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas  which generally resulted in no compensation expense recorded in the financial statements related to the issuance of equity awards to employees 
it establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for generally all share based payment transactions with employees 
on march   the sec staff issued sab no 
 share based payment  to express the views of the staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and to provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in april  the sole member at that time reserved  restricted class b units in vnr for issuance to employees 
certain members of management were granted  restricted class b units in vnr in april  which vest two years from the date of grant 
in addition  another  restricted vnr class b units were issued in august to two other employees that were hired in april and may of  which will vest after three years 
the remaining  restricted class b units are available to be awarded to new employees or members of our board of directors as they are retained 
in october and february  four board members were granted  common units each of which will vest after one year 
additionally  in october  two officers were granted options to purchase an aggregate of  units under our long term incentive plan with an exercise price equal to the initial public offering price of which vested immediately upon being granted and had a fair value of million on the date of grant 
furthermore  on march   phantom units were granted to two officers in amounts equal to of our units outstanding at january  and the amount to be paid was equal to the appreciation in value of the units  if any  from the date of the grant until the determination date december   plus cash distributions paid on the units  less an hurdle rate 
these phantom units expired on december  and no liability or expense was recognized as there was no appreciation in the value of these units 
in january  new phantom units were granted to two officers equal to of our units outstanding at january   subject to the same terms as the phantom units 
additionally  in january  four board members were each granted  common units which will vest after one year 
these common units  class b units  options and phantom units were granted as partial consideration for services to be performed under employment contracts and thus are subject to accounting for these grants under sfas r  share based payment 
with respect to the  restricted class b units granted  we expect to incur million and million in non cash compensation expense for the years and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million of non cash compensation expense  respectively 
non cash compensation expense to be incurred on the  class b units to be issued in the future will be determined based on the trading price of the units when they are granted 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fair value measurements sfas 
sfas introduces a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
on february   the fasb issued a final fasb staff position fsp no 
fas b  effective date of fasb statement no 
this fsp delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
in addition  the fsp removes certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities has been delayed by one year to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas for financial assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and the company prospectively adopted the standard for those assets and liabilities as of january  in adopting sfas  the company determined that the impact of these additional assumptions on fair value measurements did not have a material effect on financial position or results of operations 
the company is still assessing the potential impact of implementation in of those portions of the guidance for which the effective date has been deferred by the fasb 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits companies to choose  at specified dates  to measure certain eligible financial instruments at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to reduce volatility in preparer reporting that may be caused as a result of measuring related financial assets and liabilities differently and to expand the use of fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas apply only to entities that elect to use the fair value option 
additional disclosures are also required for instruments for which the fair value option is elected 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  no retrospective application is allowed  except for companies that choose to adopt early 
at the effective date  companies may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date  and the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value must be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
effective january   the company adopted sfas because the company did not elect to apply the provisions of sfas to any eligible financial instrument  the adoption did not affect the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents new pronouncements issued but not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces fasb statement no 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for acquisitions that occur in an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   which will be our fiscal year the impact  if any  on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the nature and size of business combinations that we consummate after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as non controlling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
sfas applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding non controlling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after december   which will be our fiscal year based upon the december  balance sheet  sfas would have no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas achieves these improvements by requiring disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format 
it also provides more information about an entity s liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk related 
finally  it requires cross referencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec published a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new rule permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to a report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the use of average prices will affect future impairment and depletion calculations 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reports on forms k for fiscal years ending on or after december  a company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required 
the company has not yet determined the impact of this final rule  which will vary depending on changes in commodity prices  on its disclosures  financial position or results of operations 
capital resources and liquidity disruption to functioning of capital markets multiple events during involving numerous financial institutions have effectively restricted current liquidity within the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
despite efforts by treasury and banking regulators in the united states  europe and other nations around the world to provide liquidity to the financial sector  capital markets currently remain constrained 
we expect that our ability to issue debt and equity on favorable terms will be limited as long as the capital markets remain constrained 
we intend to move forward with our development drilling program when market conditions allow for an adequate return on a drilling investment and only when we have sufficient liquidity to do so 
the benefits expected to accrue to our unitholders from our expansion activities may be muted by substantial cost of capital increases during this period 
natural gas and oil prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future  especially given current geopolitical and economic conditions 
for example  the nymex crude oil spot price per barrel for the period between january  and december  ranged from a high of to a low of and the nymex natural gas spot price per mmbtu for the period january  to december  ranged from a high of to a low of 
as of march   the nymex crude oil spot price per barrel was and the nymex natural gas spot price per mmbtu was 
overview 
table of contents we have utilized private equity  proceeds from bank borrowings  cash flow from operations  and the public equity markets for capital resources and liquidity 
to date  the primary use of capital has been for the acquisition and development of natural gas and oil properties  however  as a result of our ipo  we expect to distribute to unitholders a significant portion of our free cash flow 
as we execute our business strategy  we will continually monitor the capital resources available to us to meet future financial obligations  planned capital expenditures  acquisition capital and distributions to our unitholders 
our future success in growing reserves  production and cash flow will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us and our success in drilling for or acquiring additional reserves 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures and distributions to unitholders with cash flow from operations  while funding any acquisition capital expenditures that we might incur with borrowings under our reserve based credit facility and publicly offered equity  depending on market conditions 
as of march   we have million available to be borrowed under our reserve based credit facility 
the borrowing base is subject to adjustment from time to time but not less than on a semi annual basis based on the projected discounted present value as determined by independent petroleum engineers of estimated future net cash flows utilizing the bank s internal projection of future natural gas and oil prices from our proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in october  our borrowing base was set at million 
our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for april utilizing our december  reserve report 
based on the current commodity price environment  banks have lowered their internal projections of future natural gas and oil prices which will decrease the borrowing base and thus decrease the amount available to be borrowed under our reserve based credit facility 
however  based on preliminary discussions with our lead bank  due to our favorable hedging contracts  we anticipate that the reduction would not be material to the borrowing base as a whole and would not inhibit our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
if commodity prices continue to decline and banks continue to lower their internal projections of natural gas and oil prices  it is possible that we will be subject to decreases in our borrowing base availability in the future 
as a result  to the extent available after unitholder distributions  debt service  and capital expenditures  it is our current intention to utilize our excess cash flow during to reduce our borrowings under our reserve based credit facility 
based upon current expectations  we believe existing liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient for the conduct of our business and operations for the foreseeable future 
cash flow from operations net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was substantially due to increased income  after adjusting for non cash items  generated from increased production related to acquisitions and higher average realized prices  a decrease in cash used in price risk management activities and an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  included the termination of existing natural gas swaps at a cost of approximately million  cash paid on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  the payment of million for put option derivative contracts  and the payment of million of premiums to reset derivative strike prices at a higher value 
our cash flow from operations is subject to many variables  the most significant of which is the volatility of natural gas and oil prices 
natural gas and oil prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions  which are dependent on regional and worldwide economic and political activity  weather and other factors beyond our control 
future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to maintain and increase production through our drilling program and acquisitions  as well as the prices of natural gas and oil 
we enter into derivative contracts to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on operations 
currently  we use a combination of fixed price swaps and nymex collars and put options to reduce our exposure to the volatility in natural gas and oil prices 
please read item operations price risk management activities and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for details about derivatives in place through investing activities acquisitions and capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in the year ended december   and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to million used for the acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the permian basin and south texas 
in addition  the total for the year ended december  includes million for the drilling and development of natural gas and oil properties as compared to million for the year ended december  the total for includes million for acquisitions of natural gas and oil properties and million for deposits on acquisition of and prepayments of natural gas and oil properties 
there were no acquisitions during the totals for include million for drilling and development of natural gas properties  and million for furniture  fixtures and equipment  respectively  which includes expenditures for extensions of the gathering system and related midstream activities 
the furniture  fixtures and equipment were retained by our predecessor in the restructuring 
excluding any potential acquisitions  we currently anticipate a capital budget for of between million and million  which predominantly consists of recompletions and workovers of existing wells and a limited amount of new drilling in south texas in the second half of this capital budget is expected to be funded through cash from operations 
as of march   we had 
table of contents million available for borrowing under our reserve based credit facility 
our current borrowing base is million 
our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for april utilizing our december  reserve report 
based on the current commodity price environment  banks have lowered their internal projections of future natural gas and oil prices which will decrease the borrowing base and thus decrease the amount available to be borrowed under our reserve based credit facility 
however  based on preliminary discussions with our lead bank  due to our favorable hedging contracts  we anticipate that the reduction would not be material to the borrowing base as a whole 
if commodity prices continue to decline and banks continue to lower their internal projections of natural gas and oil prices  it is possible that we will be subject to decreases in our borrowing base availability in the future 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our reserve based credit facility will exceed our planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the year ended december  however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of natural gas production and prices 
there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   total proceeds from borrowings under our reserve based credit facility  net of repayments were million which were used to fund the permian basin and south texas acquisitions 
during the year ended december   total proceeds from borrowings under our reserve based credit facility were million  which were principally used to pay off our predecessor s outstanding borrowings 
additionally  during the year ended december   we completed a private equity offering for million and used the net proceeds of this private equity offering to make a distribution to majeed s 
nami  vnr s sole member at that time 
available credit credit markets in the united states and around the world remain constrained due to a lack of liquidity and confidence in a number of financial institutions 
investors continue to seek perceived safe investments in securities of the united states government rather than individual entities 
we may experience difficulty accessing the long term credit markets due to prevailing market conditions 
additionally  existing constraints in the credit markets may increase the rates we are charged for utilizing these markets 
notwithstanding the continuing weakness in the united states credit markets  we expect that our available liquidity is sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements into reserve based credit facility on january   we entered into a reserve based credit facility under which our initial borrowing base was set at million 
our reserve based credit facility was amended and restated in february to extend the maturity date from january to march  increase the maximum facility amount from million to million  increase our borrowing base from million to million and add two additional financial institutions as lenders  wachovia bank  na and the bank of nova scotia 
the increase in the borrowing base was principally the result of inclusion of the reserves related to the permian basin acquisition in january in may  our reserve based credit facility was amended in response to a potential acquisition that ultimately did not occur 
as a result  none of the provisions included in this amendment went into effect 
as of october   our reserve based credit facility was amended and restated to increase the borrowing base to million and add one lender  compass bank 
the increase in the borrowing base was principally the result of inclusion of the reserves related to the south texas acquisition in july at december   we had million outstanding under our reserve based credit facility and as of march   we have million available to be borrowed under our reserve based credit facility

if commodity prices continue to decline and banks continue to lower their internal projections of natural gas and oil prices  it is possible that we will be subject to decreases in our borrowing base availability in the future 
as a result  absent accretive acquisitions  it is our current intention to utilize our excess cash flow during to reduce our borrowings under our reserve based credit facility 
borrowings under the reserve based credit facility are available for development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties  working capital and general limited liability company purposes 
our obligations under the reserve based credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
at our election  interest is determined by reference to 
table of contents the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus an applicable margin between and per annum  or a domestic bank rate plus an applicable margin between and per annum 
as of december   we have elected for interest to be determined by reference to the libor method described above 
interest is generally payable quarterly for domestic bank rate loans and at the applicable maturity date for libor loans  but not less frequently than quarterly 
the reserve based credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness  grant certain liens  make certain loans  acquisitions  capital expenditures and investments  make distributions  merge or consolidate  or engage in certain asset dispositions  including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the reserve based credit facility also contains covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain specified ratios or conditions as follows consolidated net income plus interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  accretion  impairment  changes in fair value of derivative instruments and other similar charges  minus all non cash income added to consolidated net income  the aggregate amount of cash used to purchase our own units during the preceding twelve months and giving pro forma effect to any acquisitions or capital expenditures  to interest expense of not less than to consolidated current assets  including the unused amount of the total commitments  to consolidated current liabilities of not less than to  excluding non cash assets and liabilities under sfas  which includes the current portion of derivative contracts  consolidated debt to consolidated net income plus interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  accretion  impairment  changes in fair value of derivative instruments and other similar charges  minus all non cash income added to consolidated net income  and giving pro forma effect to any acquisitions or capital expenditures of not more than to we have the ability to borrow under the reserve based credit facility to pay distributions to unitholders as long as there has not been a default or event of default and if the amount of borrowings outstanding under our reserve based credit facility is less than of the borrowing base 
we believe that we are in compliance with the terms of our reserve based credit facility 
if an event of default exists under the reserve based credit agreement  the lenders will be able to accelerate the maturity of the credit agreement and exercise other rights and remedies 
each of the following will be an event of default failure to pay any principal when due or any interest  fees or other amount within certain grace periods  a representation or warranty is proven to be incorrect when made  failure to perform or otherwise comply with the covenants in the credit agreement or other loan documents  subject  in certain instances  to certain grace periods  default by us on the payment of any other indebtedness in excess of million  or any event occurs that permits or causes the acceleration of the indebtedness

contingencies the company regularly analyzes current information and accrues for probable liabilities on the disposition of certain matters  as necessary 
liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   there were no material loss contingencies 
commitments and contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is provided in the following table 
payments due by year in thousands after total management compensation asset retirement obligations derivative liabilities long term debt operating leases total this table does not include interest to be paid on the principal balances shown as the interest rates on the reserve based credit facility are variable 
includes lease agreement entered into in february which expires in april item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of 
table of contents reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
conditions sometimes arise where actual production is less than estimated  which has  and could result in overhedged volumes 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the columbia gas appalachian index teco index  henry hub and houston ship channel prices for natural gas production and the west texas intermediate light sweet price for oil production 
pricing for natural gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside our control 
in addition  the potential exists that if commodity prices decline to a certain level  the borrowing base can be decreased at the borrowing base redetermination date to an amount lower than the amount of debt currently outstanding and  because it would be uneconomical  production could decline to levels below our hedged volumes 
furthermore  the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  or if estimated future development costs increase 
for example  natural gas and oil prices declined significantly throughout the second half of we recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of natural gas and oil properties for the year ended december  of million as a result of a decline in natural gas and oil prices at the measurement date 
this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
additionally  if natural gas prices decline by per mmbtu or and oil prices declined by per barrel or  the standardized measure of our proved reserves as of december  would decrease from million to million  based on price sensitivity generated from an internal evaluation 
we enter into derivative contracts with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and oil production through various transactions that mitigate the volatility of future prices received 
these transactions may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty 
additionally  we have put options for which we pay the counterparty and option premium  equal to the fair value of the option at the purchase date 
at the settlement date we receive the excess  if any  of the fixed floor over the floating rate 
furthermore  we may enter into collars where we pay the counterparty if the market price is above the ceiling price and the counterparty pays us if the market price is below the floor on a notional quantity 
these activities are intended to support our realized commodity prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to natural gas and oil price fluctuations 
it is never management s intention to hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
at december   the fair value of commodity derivative contracts was an asset of approximately million  of which million settle during the next twelve months 
a increase in the gas and oil index price above the december  price would result in a decrease in the fair value of all of our commodity derivative contracts of approximately million  conversely  a decrease in the gas and oil index price would result in an increase of approximately million 
the following table summarizes commodity derivative contracts in place at december  gas positions fixed price swaps notional volume mmbtu fixed price mmbtu puts notional volume mmbtu floor price mmbtu collars notional volume mmbtu floor price mmbtu ceiling price mmbtu total notional volume mmbtu 
table of contents oil positions fixed price swaps notional volume bbls fixed price bbl collars notional volume bbls floor price bbl ceiling price bbl total notional volume bbls in february  we liquidated our oil swap and entered into new and natural gas swap and collar transactions 
specifically  an and fixed price nymex natural gas swap for january through september and april through september  respectively  was executed for  mmbtu day 
in addition  a  mmbtu day nymex natural gas collar with a floor price of and a ceiling price of for october through march and october through december was executed 
these natural gas derivatives were set at prices above the current market by using the proceeds of the liquidation of the oil swap 
interest rate risks at december   we had debt outstanding of million  which incurred interest at floating rates based on libor in accordance with our reserve based credit facility and if the debt remains the same  a increase in libor would result in an estimated million increase in annual interest expense after consideration of the interest rate swaps discussed below 
in december and during  we entered into interest rate swaps  which require exchanges of cash flows that serve to synthetically convert a portion of our variable interest rate exposures to fixed interest rates 
in august  we entered into two interest rate basis swaps which changed the reset option from three month libor to one month libor on the total million of outstanding interest rate swaps 
by doing so  the company reduced its borrowing cost by basis points on million of borrowings for a one year period starting september  and basis points on million of borrowings for a one year period starting october  as a result of these two basis swaps  the company chose to de designate the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as the terms of the new contracts no longer matched the terms of the original contracts  thus causing the interest rate hedges to be ineffective 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company recorded changes in the fair value of its interest rate derivatives in current earnings under gains losses on interest rate derivative contracts 
the net unrealized gain related to the de designated cash flow hedges is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified to earnings in the month in which the transactions settle
