executive summary we believe we are a leading provider of oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our rental tools segment  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our well intervention  rental tools and marine segments 
in recent years  we have expanded geographically into select domestic land and international market areas 
through our equity method investments  we also own oil and gas properties in the gulf of mexico 
the financial performance of our various products and services are reported in four different segments well intervention  rental tools  marine and oil and gas 
overview of our business segments the well intervention segment consists of specialized down hole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
we offer a wide variety of services used to maintain  enhance and extend oil and gas production from mature wells 
in  approximately of this segment s revenue was derived from work performed for customers in the gulf of mexico market area  while approximately of segment revenue was from the domestic land market area and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas 
while our income from operations as a percentage of segment revenue tends to be fairly consistent  special projects such as well control can directly increase our profitability 
the rental tools segment is capital intensive with higher operating margins as a result of relatively low operating expenses 
the largest fixed cost is depreciation as there is little labor associated with our rental tools businesses 
the financial performance primarily is a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
in  approximately of segment revenue was derived from the gulf of mexico market area  while approximately of segment revenue was from the domestic land market area and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas 
three rental products and their ancillary equipment accommodations  drill pipe and stabilization tools each account for more than of this segment s revenue in the marine segment is comprised of our rental liftboats 
operating costs of our liftboats are relatively fixed  and therefore  income from operations as percentage of revenue can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
with all of our liftboats currently operating in the gulf of mexico  our activity levels can be impacted by harsh weather  especially tropical systems that occur during hurricane season 
on march   we completed the sale of of our interest in spn resources 
spn resources operations constituted substantially all of our oil and gas segment 
subsequent to the sale  we account for our remaining interest in spn resources using the equity method see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
market drivers and conditions the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig counts  well completions and workover activity  geological characteristics of producing wells which determine the number of services required per well  oil and gas production levels  and customers spending allocated for drilling and production work  which is reflected in our customers operating expenses or capital expenditures 

table of contents historical market indicators are listed below change change worldwide rig count us international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information 
excludes canada rig count 
although the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased over to per barrel  on february   the price was under per barrel  indicative of the rapid decline in demand for oil as a result of the global recession 
a similar decrease has also occurred in natural gas prices in the united states 
this has also lead to a precipitous decline in the drilling rig count 
since peaking at  average rigs working during the third quarter of  the average number of drilling rigs working in the united states has dropped more than to  by the end of february the downturn in industry fundamentals  which also includes announced reductions in capital expenditures by our customers  will reduce demand for our products and services  especially in north america where industry conditions are worsening more rapidly than other geographic markets 
in addition to lower utilization of our equipment  we would expect our customers to seek price reductions for our products and services 
factors impacting our financial performance several factors contributed to our financial performance in first  we continued to execute our long term growth strategy of expanding geographically in an effort to reduce our dependency on a single geographic region  especially the gulf of mexico 
as evidence of our successful execution of the diversification strategy  our non gulf of mexico revenue was the highest in the company s history at approximately million as compared with approximately million in second  we experienced a significant increase in revenue and income from operations from the gulf of mexico market primarily in the well intervention segment due to our performance on a large scale platform decommissioning project  which commenced during the first quarter of and accounted for an approximate increase in this segment s revenue for we currently estimate this work will be completed in the first half of third  average oil and natural gas prices increased over averages  which positively impacted customer spending on drilling and production related projects 
fourth  the average number of rigs drilling for oil and natural gas in domestic and international market areas increased over  which directly impacts demand for most of our rental tools and serves as a proxy for customer spending and activity levels on well intervention services 
fifth  activity levels in the gulf of mexico were curtailed during the last four months of the year for some well intervention services as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike 
both hurricanes resulted in downtime throughout our company in the days following the storms 
however  demand for certain production related services was curtailed for an extended period as customers focused their resources on assessing damage to their platforms and pipelines  and restoring production 
sixth  our income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to the march sale of of our interest in spn resources  our oil and gas production subsidiary which contributed strong profitability in as a result of high commodity prices 
geographically  our largest increase in revenue was from the gulf of mexico market area  which increased over to  million or of total revenue due primarily to the aforementioned large scale platform decommissioning project 
revenue from our domestic land market operations increased over to approximately million 
this was primarily due to increased activity levels and capital expenditures 
international revenue was approximately million  or of total revenue 
the primary reasons for the increase were further expansion of our rental tools segment in south america and contributions from a small acquisition in the well intervention segment in europe 
this growth was partially offset by reduced demand for 
table of contents rental tools in the north sea  repositioning of a derrick barge from the asia pacific market to the gulf of mexico and the successful completion of a derrick barge construction project for an asia pacific customer early in industry outlook the strong industry conditions that prevailed in have declined in early and are expected to worsen throughout the year 
the global credit crisis which was a catalyst for an economic recession in the united states as well as in other countries has sharply curtailed demand for oil and natural gas  especially demand from industrial users 
in addition  the inability to access capital by industrial users of oil and natural gas and by exploration and production companies seeking to fund exploration and development projects has contributed to the decrease in hydrocarbon demand 
the confluence of events has created sharp decreases in oil and natural gas prices and the number of rigs drilling for oil and natural gas especially in north america since the end of many industry observers believe the long term demand fundamentals of the energy sector remain in place increasing demand for hydrocarbons from emerging countries coupled with challenges in meaningfully increasing supply due to high rates of depletion from new oil and natural gas reservoirs  an aging infrastructure to adequately meet new supply challenges and a lack of economically viable sources of alternative energy 
however  in the short term  demand for oilfield services particularly demand in north america will continue to come under pressure 
lower commodity prices will make certain projects uneconomical  further reduce demand for drilling and potentially shut in oil and gas production 
these conditions will negatively impact demand for our products and services  resulting in lower prices and utilization 
in response to these uncertain times  we are taking steps to ensure we are prepared for near term market conditions while maintaining our growth strategy 
we believe we can reduce headcount through natural attrition without making large scale reductions in our workforce 
where possible  we will move assets to other markets  consolidate facilities and reduce operating costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  long term construction accounting and self insurance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels and operating performance 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
assets are grouped by subsidiary or division for the impairment testing  except for liftboats  which are grouped together by leg length 
these groupings represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
the company has long lived assets  such as facilities  utilized by multiple operating divisions that do not have identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing for these long lived assets is based 
table of contents on the consolidated entity 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on our estimate of fair value and carrying value at december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our business segments using various cash flow and earnings projections discounted at a rate estimated to approximate the reporting units weighted average cost of capital 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
based on business conditions and market values that existed at december   we concluded that no impairment loss were required 
however  the market value of our common stock continues to be depressed and we continue to experience difficult economic environments and significant competition in most of our markets 
if  among other factors  our equity value remains depressed or declines further  the fair value of our reporting units decline  or the adverse impacts of economic or competitive factors are worse than anticipated  we could conclude in future periods that impairment losses are required in order to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill  and  to a lesser extent  long lived assets 
depending on the severity of the changes in the key factors underlying the valuation of our reporting units  such losses could be significant 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the rate is enacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against those balances that do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we contract for marine  well intervention and environmental projects either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
our rental tools are rented on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
we use the percentage of completion method for recognizing our revenues and related costs on our 
table of contents contract to decommission seven downed oil and gas platforms and related well facilities located in the gulf of mexico 
we estimate the percentage complete utilizing costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs 
long term construction accounting for revenue and profit loss recognition 
a portion of our revenue is derived from long term contracts 
for contracts that meet the criteria under statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  we recognize revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and profitability for contracts currently in process 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
the accuracy of the revenue and estimated earnings we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make in estimating our contract performance and contract revenue and costs 
self insurance 
we self insure  through deductibles and retentions  up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  third party liability insurances  property damage  and group medical 
with our growth  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we also have actuarial reviews of our estimates for losses related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenue was  million  resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
the results included a pre tax gain of million from the sale of businesses 
for the year ended december   revenue was  million  and net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
net income for the year ended december  included a pre tax gain of million from the sale of a non core rental tool business 
revenue in the well intervention segment was higher primarily as a result of an increase in engineering and project management services associated with a large scale platform decommissioning project 
revenue in the rental tools segment was higher as a result of increased production related projects and drilling activity worldwide  recent acquisitions and continued expansion of our rental tool business 
both revenue and income from operations decreased in our marine segment due to lower utilization and dayrates 
revenue in our oil and gas segment decreased due the fact that we sold of our interest in spn resources in march spn resources represented substantially all of our operating oil and gas segment 
subsequent to the sale of our interest on march   we account for our remaining interest in spn resources using the equity method

total the following discussion analyzes our results on a segment basis 
well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was  million for the year ended december   as compared to million for cost of services remained constant at of segment revenue in and our revenue increased as the result of our performance on a large scale platform decommissioning project  which we expect to complete in the first half of we also experienced an increase in revenue from a full year of expansion of wireline and snubbing services in continental europe 
additionally  revenue from coiled tubing services increased approximately mainly from additional activity and the addition of new equipment in domestic land market areas 
these increases were offset by a decrease in revenue from the completion of a construction contract for the sale of a derrick barge in june we recognized revenue for this construction contract throughout using the percentage of completion method 
revenue from land and international market areas grew and  respectively  in rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from the same period in cost of services remained constant at of segment revenue in and our largest increases in revenue were generated from our stabilizers and on site accommodations 
these increases were partially offset by the loss of revenue from the sale of a non core rental business in our largest geographic revenue improvements were in the gulf of mexico where revenue increased to approximately million in over the same period in we also experienced significant increases in the south american and african market areas 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in drill pipe rental from the north sea market 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased from to million 
conversely  cost of services increased for the year ended december  from the same period in due to lower utilization  increased maintenance and higher direct costs 
the increase in maintenance cost is partially due to the fact that we use periods of lower utilization as an opportunity to perform required maintenance to our liftboat fleet 
additionally  cost of services usually does not fluctuate proportionately with revenue due to the high fixed costs associated with this segment 
the fleet s average utilization decreased to approximately in from in the fleet s average dayrate decreased to approximately  in from  in 
table of contents oil and gas segment in march  we sold of our interest in spn resources for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain on sale of this business of approximately million 
spn resources represented substantially all of our oil and gas segment 
subsequent to the sale of our interest on march   we account for our remaining interest in spn resources using the equity method 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in depreciation  depletion and accretion for our oil and gas segment decreased million  or  in from as a result of the sale of our interest in spn resources on march   we ceased the depreciation and depletion for this segment when these assets were identified as available for sale in january depreciation and amortization expense related to our well intervention and rental tools segments for increased by million  or  from the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for these segments is primarily attributable to our and capital expenditures 
depreciation expense related to the marine segment in increased approximately million  or  from the increase in depreciation expense for the marine segment is primarily attributable to the delivery of two new vessels  which was partially offset by lower utilization 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in general and administrative expenses related to our well intervention and rental tools segments increased million  or  from to the increase in general and administrative expense is primarily related to increased expenses associated with our geographic expansion  increased retirement benefits  increased incentive compensation expenses due to our strong operating results and additional infrastructure to enhance our growth 
general and administrative expenses remained constant at approximately of revenue for and comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenue was  million  resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share

net income for the year ended december  includes a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
revenue and income from operations were higher in the well intervention and rental tools segments as a result of increased production related projects and drilling activity worldwide  acquisitions and continued expansion of our rental tool business 
both revenue and income from operations decreased in our marine segment due to lower utilization 
both revenue and income from operations in our oil and gas segment were significantly higher due to higher commodity prices and higher production as a portion of production was impacted by shut in production due to hurricanes katrina and rita

table of contents the following discussion analyzes our results on a segment basis 
well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for cost of services decreased to of segment revenue in from in  primarily due to the segment s increase in revenue and a change in business mix 
we experienced higher revenue for most of our production related services 
approximately of our increase in revenue is attributable to acquisition and disposition activities occurring late in and throughout an additional of the increase in revenue is from a full year of activity related to the charter of a derrick barge as well as a contract to construct a derrick barge to be sold to a third party for approximately million 
the balance of the increase in revenue is attributable to increased well control and hydraulic workover services as production related activity improved 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for was million  a increase over the cost of rentals and sales percentage remained relatively constant at in as compared to in in  we sold the assets of a non core rental business 
we experienced significant increases in revenue from our stabilizers  on site accommodations  drill pipe and accessories  and drill collars 
the increases are a result of acquisitions  expansion of rental products through capital expenditures  and increased activity worldwide 
our international revenue for the rental tools segment increased to approximately million in over our largest improvements were in the north sea  south american and africa market areas 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased from to million 
our cost of services percentage increased to in as compared to in primarily due to lower utilization and an increase in our labor and maintenance costs 
due to the high fixed costs associated with this segment  the cost of services percentage increases at an accelerated rate when revenue declines 
the fleet s average utilization decreased to approximately in from in due to increased idle days resulting from lower demand  inspections  maintenance and poor weather conditions in the gulf of mexico which prevent our liftboats from mobilizing in high seas 
the fleet s average dayrate increased approximately to approximately  in from  in oil and gas segment oil and gas revenue was million in the year ended december   as compared to million in in  production was approximately  boe  as compared to approximately  boe in the cost of sales percentage decreased to in from in due to increased production and commodity prices 
in  shut in production resulting from damage caused by the hurricane season did not fully return until the second quarter of depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million in the year ended december  from million in approximately of our increase in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to acquisitions occurring late in and throughout an additional increase in depletion and accretion is directly attributable to increased oil and gas production and capital expenditures in our oil and gas segment 
the balance of the increase results from the depreciation associated with our and capital expenditures  primarily in the well intervention and rental tools segment 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in approximately of our increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to acquisitions occurring late in and throughout the remainder of this increase was primarily attributable to increased expense related to our continued growth through expanding our geographic area of operations and acquisitions as well as increased incentive compensation expense due to our strong operating results 
general and administrative expenses remained constant at approximately of revenue for and liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million as compared to million in the decrease in cash generated from operating activities is primarily due to the increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to a large scale platform decommissioning contract in the gulf of mexico 
this will be billed and collected in the first half of our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  we made approximately million of capital expenditures during the year ended december  approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory 
we also made million and million of capital expenditures to expand and maintain the asset base of our well intervention and marine segments  respectively 
in addition  we made million of capital expenditures on construction and improvements to our facilities 
in march  we sold of our interest in spn resources for approximately million 
in connection with the disposition of our controlling interest in spn resources  we retained performance guarantees related to spn resources decommissioning liabilities 
additionally  we retained preferential rights on certain service work and entered into a turnkey contract to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work associated with the oil and gas properties owned and operated by spn resources at the closing 
the turnkey contract covers only routine end of life well abandonment and pipeline and platform decommissioning for properties owned and operated by spn resources at the date of closing and has a remaining fixed price of approximately million as of december  the turnkey contract consists of numerous  separate billable jobs estimated to be performed between and during the year ended december   we received million of cash distributions from spn resources 
in connection with the sale of assets of a non core rental tool business in august and certain conditions being met during the year ended december   we received approximately million of additional cash consideration  which resulted in an additional pre tax gain on sale of business of approximately million 
in april  we contracted to purchase a interest in four foot class liftboats for approximately million with scheduled delivery dates through through december   we have spent approximately million for our interest in these liftboats 
in january  the party controlling the other interest in the four liftboats exercised its option to require us to purchase its undivided ownership interest in these vessels 
we have a million bank revolving credit facility 
any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due on june  at february   we had approximately million outstanding under the bank credit facility 
additionally  we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding  which reduces our borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  create liens or incur additional indebtedness

government guaranteed long term financing under title xi of the merchant marine act of  which is administered by the maritime administration marad  for two foot class liftboats 
this debt bears interest at the rate of per annum and is payable in equal semi annual installments of  on every june rd and december rd through june  our obligations are secured by mortgages on the two liftboats 
this marad financing also requires that we comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to equity requirements 
we have million of unsecured senior notes due the indenture governing the notes requires semi annual interest payments  on every june st and december st through the maturity date of june  the indenture contains certain covenants that  among other things  restrict us from incurring additional debt  repurchasing capital stock  paying dividends or making other distributions  incurring liens  selling assets or entering into certain mergers or acquisitions

the company s current long term issuer credit rating is bb by standard and poor s and ba by moody s 
our credit rating may be impacted by the rating agencies view of the cyclical nature of our industry sector 
under certain circumstances  holders may exchange the senior exchangeable notes for shares of our common stock 
the initial exchange rate is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
this is equal to an initial exchange price of per share 
the exchange price represents a premium over the closing share price at the date of issuance 
the notes may be exchanged under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter commencing after march   if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price of the notes for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  prior to december   during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price of  principal amount of notes for each trading day in the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the exchange rate on such trading day  if the notes have been called for redemption  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or at any time beginning on september   and ending at the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
in connection with the exchangeable note transaction  we simultaneously entered into agreements with affiliates of the initial purchasers to purchase call options and sell warrants on our common stock 
we may exercise the call options we purchased at any time to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the owners of the warrants may exercise the warrants to purchase from us approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other customary adjustments 
the warrants may be settled in cash  in shares or in a combination of cash and shares  at our option 
these transactions may potentially reduce the dilution of our common stock from the exchange of the notes by increasing the effective exchange price to per share 
lehman brothers otc derivatives  inc lbotc is the counterparty to of our call option and warrant transactions 
on october   lbotc filed for bankruptcy protection  which is an event of default under the contracts relating to the call option and warrant transactions 
we have not terminated these contracts and continue to carefully monitor the developments affecting lbotc 
although we may not retain the benefit of the call option due to lbotc s bankruptcy  we do not expect that there will be a material impact  if any  on the financial statements or results of operations 
the call option and warrant transactions described above do not affect the terms of the outstanding exchangeable notes 

table of contents during the year ended december   we purchased and retired  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of per share  or million in the aggregate 
these purchases were made in connection with our authorized million share repurchase program that will expire on december  as of december   we have approximately million remaining available for purchase under this program 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  amounts in thousands for our long term debt including estimated interest payments  operating leases  contractual obligations and other long term liabilities 
we do not have any other material obligations or commitments 
description thereafter long term debt  including estimated interest payments operating leases vessel construction other long term liabilities total we currently believe that we will make approximately million of capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions and targeted asset purchases  during to expand our rental tool asset base  add new coiled tubing and electric line units and complete construction on our liftboats 
we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make the capital expenditures required to implement our growth strategy in amounts consistent with the amount of cash generated from operating activities  the availability of additional financing and our credit facility 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than our potential additional consideration that may be payable as a result of the future operating performances of our acquisitions 
at december   the maximum additional consideration payable for our prior acquisitions was approximately million 
these amounts are not classified as liabilities under current generally accepted accounting principles and are not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
we do not have any other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements 
hedging activities we entered into hedging transactions in that expired on august  to secure a commodity price for a portion of our oil production and to reduce our exposure to oil price fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
we used financially settled crude oil swaps and zero cost collars that provided floor and ceiling prices with varying upside price participation 
our swaps and zero cost collars were designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
for the year ended december   hedging settlement payments reduced oil and gas revenue by approximately million  and no gains or losses were recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness

table of contents foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for our international operations  other than our operations in the united kingdom  germany and the netherlands  is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenue from these foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with complex features 
assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany and the netherlands are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity
