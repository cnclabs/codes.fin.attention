item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
raw materials the primary raw materials used in chloride process tio are titanium containing feedstock natural rutile ore or purchased slag  chlorine and coke 
chlorine and coke are available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in australia  south africa  canada  india and the united states 
we purchase chloride process grade slag from rio tinto iron and titanium under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of we purchase natural rutile ore primarily from iluka resources  limited under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of we expect to be successful in obtaining long term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration 
we expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts to meet our chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years 
the primary raw materials used in sulfate process tio are titanium containing feedstock primarily ilmenite from our norwegian mine or purchased slag and sulfuric acid 
sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in norway  canada  australia  india and south africa 
as one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate process tio we own and operate a rock ilmenite mine in norway  which provided all of the feedstock for our european sulfate process tio plants in we expect ilmenite production from our mine to meet our european sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future 
for our canadian sulfate process plant  we also purchase sulfate grade slag primarily from qit fer et titane inc also a subsidiary of rio tinto iron and titanium  under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of and tinfos titan and iron ks under a supply contract that expires in we expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts to meet our sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next few years 
many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase  although these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased 
the pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated annually 
the following table summarizes our raw materials purchased or mined in production process raw material raw materials procured or mined in thousands of metric tons chloride process plants purchased slag or natural rutile ore sulfate process plants raw ilmenite ore mined used internally purchased slag tio manufacturing joint venture we hold a interest in a manufacturing joint venture with huntsman corporation huntsman 
the joint venture owns and operates a chloride process tio facility located in lake charles  louisiana 
we share production from the plant equally with huntsman pursuant to separate offtake agreements 
a supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture  including production and output decisions 
this committee is composed of four members  two of whom we appoint and two of whom huntsman appoints 
two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee 
we appoint one general manager and huntsman appoints the other 
we are required to purchase one half of the tio produced by the joint venture 
the joint venture is not consolidated in our financial statements  because we do not control it 
we account for our interest in the joint venture by the equity method 
the joint venture operates on a break even basis  and therefore we do not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture 
we share all costs and capital expenditures of the joint venture equally with huntsman with the exception of raw material and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced 
our share of the net costs is reported as cost of sales as the related tio is sold 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the tio industry is highly competitive 
our principal competitors are ei du pont de nemours co  millennium inorganic chemicals  inc a subsidiary of national titanium dioxide company ltd 
cristal  tronox incorporated  huntsman  and ishihara sangyo kaisha  ltd 
these competitors have estimated individual shares of tio production capacity ranging from for ishihara to for dupont  and an estimated aggregate share of worldwide tio production volume in excess of 
dupont has about one half of total north american tio production capacity and is our principal north american competitor 
tronox filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in january  and it is unclear how and to what extent tronox or a successor will compete in the tio industry at the conclusion of tronox s bankruptcy proceedings 
we compete primarily on the basis of price  product quality  technical service and the availability of high performance pigment grades 
although certain tio grades are considered specialty pigments  the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigments with price generally being the most significant competitive factor 
we believe that we are the leading seller of tio in several countries  including germany  with an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume in overall  we are the world s fifth largest producer of tio over the past ten years  we and our competitors have increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects 
given the current economic environment and reduced industry demand  we do not expect any significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our competitors to further increase capacity through such projects for the foreseeable future 
in addition  huntsman announced the closure of one of its european facilities 
we believe further shutdowns or closures in the industry are possible 
even with these reductions in industry capacity  capacity utilization rates by us and our competitors are expected to be lower in as compared to as a response to a reduction in industry wide demand  which in turn will result in downward pressure on average tio selling prices 
once the economic environment improves and industry wide demand increases  the expected reduction in industry wide capacity through plant shutdowns should have a favorable impact on production capacity utilization  selling prices and profitability 
however  the volatility of the near term economic environment makes it difficult to forecast future demand 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  ours and the tio industry s performances could continue to be unfavorably affected longer than expected 
worldwide capacity additions in the tio market resulting from construction of new plants require significant capital expenditures and substantial lead time typically three to five years in our experience 
we are not aware of any tio plants currently under construction  and we believe it is not likely that any new plants will be constructed in the foreseeable future 
research and development our research and development activities are directed primarily at improving the chloride and sulfate production processes  improving product quality and strengthening our competitive position by developing new pigment applications 
our research and development activities are conducted at our leverkusen  germany facility 
our expenditures for research and development and certain technical support programs were approximately million in and million in each of and we plan to scale back our research and development activities in due to the current adverse economic environment  consequently our research and development expenditures in are expected to be lower as compared to recent history 
we continually seek to improve the quality of our grades and have been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of customers and increase product life cycle 
since  we have added over new grades for plastics  coatings  fibers and paper laminate applications 
patents and trademarks we believe that our patents held for products and production processes are important to us and our continuing business activities 
we seek patent protection for our technical developments  principally in the united states  canada and europe  and from time to time we enter into licensing arrangements with third parties 
our existing patents generally have terms of years from the date of filing  and have remaining terms ranging from to years 
we seek to protect our intellectual property rights  including our patent rights  and from time to time are engaged in disputes relating to the protection and use of intellectual property relating to our products 
our trademarks  including kronos  are protected by registration in the united states and elsewhere with respect to those products we manufacture and sell 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation  and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology  and our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain confidentiality of our trade secrets used in this technology 
major customers we sell to a diverse customer base  and no single customer made up more than of our sales for our largest ten customers accounted for approximately of sales in seasonality neither our business as a whole nor that of any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent 
however  tio sales are generally higher in the first half of the year 
this is due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting season 
employees as of december   we employed the following number of people europe canada united states total excludes employees of our louisiana joint venture 
our hourly employees in production facilities worldwide  including the tio joint venture  are represented by a variety of labor unions under labor agreements with various expiration dates 
our european union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements in the chemicals industry that are generally renewed annually 
our canadian union employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in june regulatory and environmental matters our operations are governed by various environmental laws and regulations 
certain of our operations are  or have been  engaged in the handling  manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations 
as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage 
we have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks 
our policy is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all of our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance 
it is possible that future developments  such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies  could adversely affect our production  handling  use  storage  transportation  sale or disposal of such substances and could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity 
our us manufacturing operations are governed by federal environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations 
these primarily consist of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the occupational safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the toxic substances control act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act cercla  as well as the state counterparts of these statutes 
we believe the tio plant owned by the joint venture and a tio slurry facility owned by us in lake charles  louisiana are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of these laws or compliance orders issued thereunder 
these are our only us manufacturing facilities 
while the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in europe vary from country to country  a common regulatory framework is provided by the european union eu 
germany and belgium are members of the eu and follow its initiatives 
norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the eu 
we believe we have obtained all required permits and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements for our european and canadian facilities 
at our sulfate plant facilities in germany  we recycle weak sulfuric acid either through contracts with third parties or at our own facilities 
in addition  at our german locations we have a contract with a third party to treat certain sulfate process effluents 
at our norwegian plant  we ship spent acid to a third party location where it is used as a neutralization agent 
these contracts may be terminated by either party after giving three or four years advance notice  depending on the contract 
from time to time  our facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under us and us statutes 
typically we establish compliance programs to resolve these matters 
occasionally  we may pay penalties 
to date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we believe that all of our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
in december  the eu approved registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach  which took effect on june  and will be phased in over years 
under reach  companies that manufacture or import more than one ton of a chemical substance per year will be required to register such chemical substances in a central data base 
reach affects our european operations by imposing a testing  evaluation and registration program for many of the chemicals we use or produce in europe 
we have established a reach team that is working to identify and list all substances purchased  manufactured or imported by or for us in the eu 
we spent 
million in and 
million in on reach compliance  and we do not anticipate that future compliance costs will be material to us 
capital expenditures in related to ongoing environmental compliance  protection and improvement programs were million  and are currently expected to be approximately million in website and other available information our fiscal year ends december our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and any amendments to those reports are available on our website at www

item a 
risk factors below are certain risk factors associated with our business 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
demand for  and prices of  certain of our products are influenced by changing market conditions and we are currently operating in a depressed worldwide market for our products  which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
approximately of our revenues are attributable to sales of tio pricing within the global tio industry over the long term is cyclical  and changes in economic conditions  especially in western industrialized nations  can significantly impact our earnings and operating cash flows 
the current world wide economic downturn has depressed sales volumes in the fourth quarter of  and we are unable to predict with a high degree of certainty when demand will return to the levels experienced prior to the fourth quarter of this may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
historically  the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of increasing and decreasing demand 
relative changes in the selling prices for our products are one of the main factors that affect the level of our profitability 
in periods of increasing demand  our selling prices and profit margins generally will tend to increase  while in periods of decreasing demand our selling prices and profit margins generally tend to decrease 
huntsman announced the closure of one if its european facilities  and we believe further shutdowns or closures in the industry are possible 
the closures may not be sufficient to alleviate the current excess industry capacity and such conditions may be further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated capacity additions or other events 
the demand for tio during a given year is also subject to annual seasonal fluctuations 
tio sales are generally higher in the first half of the year 
this is due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting season 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion on production and price changes 
we sell several of our products in mature and highly competitive industries and face price pressures in the markets in which we operate  which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
the global markets in which we operate our business are highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  such as price  product quality and service 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers may result in reduced demand for our products or make it more difficult for us to compete with our competitors 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities so they could manufacture products that compete with our products 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
higher costs or limited availability of our raw materials may reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity 
the number of sources for and availability of  certain raw materials is specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located 
for example  titanium containing feedstocks suitable for use in our tio facilities are available from a limited number of suppliers around the world 
political and economic instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability 
if our worldwide vendors were unable to meet their contractual obligations and we were unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we could incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels 
we may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher costs or reduced production levels  which could reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity 
negative global economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial results 
we extend credit and payment terms to our customers 
although we have an ongoing process of evaluating customers financial condition  we could suffer significant losses if a customer fails and is unable to pay 
a significant loss of an accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our leverage may impair our financial condition or limit our ability to operate our businesses 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   our total consolidated debt was approximately million  which relates to senior secured notes  a revolving credit facility of our wholly owned subsidiary  kronos international  inc  a revolving credit facility of our us subsidiary  and a note payable to affiliate 
our level of debt could have important consequences to our stockholders and creditors  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our liabilities  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  requiring that a portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt  which reduces our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  dividends on our common stock  acquisitions or general corporate requirements  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors 
in addition to our indebtedness  we are party to various lease and other agreements pursuant to which  along with our indebtedness  we are committed to pay approximately million in our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt  and to fund planned capital expenditures  depends on our future ability to generate cash flow 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds under our subsidiaries credit facilities in the future will  in some instances  depend in part on these subsidiaries ability to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants contained in the applicable credit agreement 
in this regard  we currently believe it is probable that one of our required financial ratios associated with our european credit facility will not be maintained at some point during  most likely commencing at march  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability 
our business may not generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when they become due and to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt in a timely manner on favorable terms  if at all in the current credit markets 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flows or to refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations business overview we are a leading global producer and marketer of value added tio tio is used for a variety of manufacturing applications  including plastics  paints  paper and other industrial products 
for  approximately one half of our sales volumes was sold into european markets 
we believe that we are the second largest producer of tio in europe with an estimated share of european tio sales volumes 
in addition  we estimate that we have a share of north american tio sales volumes 
our production facilities are located throughout europe and north america 
we consider tio to be a quality of life product  with demand affected by gross domestic product and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world 
over the long term  we expect demand for tio to grow by to per year 
this is consistent with our expectations for the long term growth in gross domestic product 
however  demand for tio in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in gdp even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market 
this is due in part to relative changes in the tio inventory levels of our customers 
we believe that our customers inventory levels are partly influenced by their expectation for future changes in the market tio selling prices 
the factors having the most impact on our reported income from operations are tio selling prices  currency exchange rates particularly the exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the euro  norwegian krone and the canadian dollar  tio sales and production volumes  and manufacturing costs  particularly maintenance and energy related expenses 
our key performance indicators are our tio average selling prices  and our level of tio sales and production volumes 
tio selling prices generally follow industry trends and prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures 
in addition  our effective income tax rate in  and has been impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments 
executive summary we reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share for  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share for our diluted earnings per share increased from to due primarily to the net effects of i an income tax benefit we recognized in  ii lower income from operations in resulting principally from lower sales volumes and higher raw material and energy costs and iii the unfavorable effect of certain provisions for income taxes recognized in we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in our diluted earnings per share decreased from to due primarily to the net effect of i lower income from operations in  ii the unfavorable effect of certain provisions for income taxes recognized in  iii the favorable effect of certain income tax benefits recognized in and iv a charge in from the redemption of our senior secured notes 
net income for includes a million income tax benefit 
per diluted share related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
net income for includes i a non cash charge of million per diluted share relating to a decrease in our net deferred income tax asset in germany resulting from the reduction in their income tax rates  ii a non cash charge of million 
per diluted share related to the adjustment of certain german income tax attributes and iii a million income tax benefit 
per diluted share resulting from a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
net income for includes i a charge related to the prepayment of our senior secured notes of million  net of tax benefit  
per diluted share and ii a net income tax benefit of million 
per diluted share related to the net effect of the withdrawal of certain income tax assessments previously made by the belgian and norwegian tax authorities  the resolution of certain income tax issues related to our german and belgian operations and the enactment of a reduction in the canadian federal income tax rate 
we currently expect income from operations will be lower in compared to primarily as a result of higher production costs due in part to significantly reduced production volumes and the resulting unabsorbed fixed production costs and unfavorable currency effects 
we currently expect to report a net loss in as compared to reporting net income in due to lower expected income from operations in critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  the recoverability of long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ significantly from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements long lived assets 
we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
we do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  specified in sfas no 
 are present 
we did not evaluate any long lived assets for impairment during because no such impairment indicators were present 
pension and opeb plans 
we maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting in accordance with the recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
at december   we have concluded that no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized with respsect to such carryforwards  principally because i such carry forwards have an indefinite carryforward period  ii we have generated cumulative income in germany over the most recent three year period and consequently utilized a portion of such carryforwards during that period and iii we currently expect to utilize the remainder of such carryforwards over the long term 
however  prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  particularly if the current economic downturn continues and we were to generate losses in our german operations for an extended period of time  it is possible that we might conclude the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point we would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against some or all of the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
it is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made 
in addition  we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non us subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us contingencies 
we record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change

effects of currency exchange rates we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
the majority of our non us operations sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
certain raw materials used worldwide  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and income from operations for the periods indicated

increase decrease in millions impact on net sales income from operations other on september   the chloride process tio facility operated by our owned joint venture  louisiana pigment company lpc  temporarily halted production due to hurricane rita and as a result  both we and lpc filed claims with our insurers 
we recognized a gain of million related to our business interruption claim in  which is included in other operating income on our consolidated statement of operations 
outlook we currently expect income from operations will be lower in compared to primarily from higher production costs resulting in part from significantly reduced production volumes and the resulting unabsorbed fixed production costs and unfavorable currency effects 
we currently expect to report a net loss in as compared to reporting net income in due to lower expected income from operations in in response to the worldwide economic slowdown and weak consumer confidence  we are significantly reducing our production volumes in in order to reduce our finished goods inventory and improve our liquidity 
while overall industry pigment demand is expected to be lower in as compared to as a result of worldwide economic conditions  we currently expect our sales volumes in will be slightly higher as compared to  as we expect to gain market share following anticipated reductions in industry capacity due to competitors permanent plant shutdowns 
we believe average selling prices in will decline from year end levels during the first half of the year but will rise during the second half of which should result in slightly higher average worldwide tio selling prices for the year 
to mitigate the negative impact of our significantly reduced production volumes  we are reducing our operating costs where possible  such as  reducing maintenance expenditures  research development expenditures and personnel costs 
our expectations as to the future of the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond our control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  solvency and continued operation of competitors  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions or reductions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
we believe that our annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons 
we expect our production volumes in will be significantly lower than our attainable capacity 
we currently expect we will operate at to of our attainable production capacity in our expected capacity utilization levels could be adjusted upwards or downwards to match changes in demand for our product 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities trends in cash flows as a result of our operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in our earnings 
cash flows from operating activities decreased to million in from million in this million decrease was due primarily to the net effect of the following items lower income from operations in of million  higher net cash used by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in as compared to  due primarily to relative changes in our inventory levels  as discussed below  lower cash paid for income taxes in of million  in part due lower taxable income and the receipt of tax refunds at our european operating units  higher net distributions from our tio joint venture in of million due to related changes in their cash flow  higher cash paid for interest in of million  as a result of increased borrowing and the effects of currency exchange rates on the semiannual interest payments on our senior secured notes  and higher depreciation expense of million in  primarily as a result of the effects of currency exchange rates 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in this million increase was due primarily to the net effects of the following items lower income from operations in of million  higher net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in as compared to  due primarily to relative changes in our inventory levels  as discussed below  payment of the million call premium in as a result of the prepayment of our senior secured notes  which is required to be included in cash flows from operating activities  lower cash paid for income taxes in of million  in part due to the net payment of million in associated with the settlement of prior year income tax audits  higher net contributions to our tio joint venture in of million due to related changes in their cash flow  higher cash paid for interest in of million  primarily as a result of the effects of currency exchange rates on the semiannual interest payments on our senior secured notes  and higher depreciation expense of million in  primarily as a result of the effects of currency exchange rates 
changes in working capital are affected by accounts receivable and inventory changes 
our average days sales outstanding dso increased from days at december  to days at december  due to the timing of collection on receivable balances at the end of for comparative purposes  our average dso increased from days at december  to days at december  our average days sales in inventory dsi increased from days at december  to days at december   as our sales volumes decreased in mostly in the fourth quarter and our production volumes exceeded our tio sales volumes during the last half of for comparative purposes  our average dsi decreased to days at december  from days at december  investing activities our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures are primarily for improvements and upgrades to existing facilities 
our capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of approximately million million in for our ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs

outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability at december   our consolidated debt was comprised of euro million principal amount of our senior secured notes million due in  euro million million under our european revolving credit facility which matures in may  million under our us revolving credit facility which matures in september  million under our revolving note with nl which matures in december  and approximately million of other indebtedness 
certain of our credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with applicable covenants 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined in the agreement of the borrower 
in addition  certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
none of our credit agreements contain provisions that link the debt payment rates or schedules or borrowing availability to our credit rating 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december  certain of our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants contained in the applicable credit agreement 
while we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december   we currently believe it is probable that one of our required financial ratios associated with our european credit facility the ratio of net secured debt to earnings before income taxes  interest and depreciation  as defined will not be maintained at some point during  most likely commencing at march  in  we have begun to reduce our production levels in response to the current economic environment  which we anticipate will favorably impact our liquidity and cash flows by reducing our inventory levels 
however  the reduced capacity utilization levels will negatively impact our results of operations due to the resulting unabsorbed fixed production costs that will be charged to expense as incurred 
as a result  we may not be able to maintain the required financial ratio throughout we have begun discussions with the lenders to amend the terms of the existing european credit facility to eliminate the requirement to maintain this financial ratio until at least march  while we believe it is possible we can obtain such an amendment to eliminate this financial ratio through at least march   there is no assurance that such amendment will be obtained  or if obtained that the requirement to maintain the financial ratio will be eliminated or waived  in the event the lenders would only agree to a waiver and not an amendment to eliminate the covenant itself through at least march  any such amendment or waiver which we might obtain could increase our future borrowing costs  either from a requirement that we pay a higher rate of interest on outstanding borrowings or pay a fee to the lenders as part of agreeing to such amendment or waiver 
in the event we would not be successful in obtaining the amendment or waiver of the existing european credit facility to eliminate the requirement to maintain the financial ratio  we would seek to refinance such facility with a new group of lenders with terms that did not include such financial covenant or  if required  we will use our existing liquidity resources which could include funds provided by our affiliates 
while there is no assurance that we would be able to refinance the existing european credit facility with a new group of lenders  we believe these other sources of liquidity available to us would allow us to refinance the existing european credit facility 
if required  we believe by undertaking one or more of these steps we will be successful in maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet our future obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service for the next months 
during the second quarter of  we amended our european revolving bank credit facility to extend the maturity date by three years to may during the third quarter of  we amended our us revolving bank credit facility to increase the size of the facility from million to million and to extend the maturity date by three years to september our canadian revolving credit facility had a maturity date of january  prior to maturity we temporarily extended our existing borrowing terms under our canadian revolving credit facility and we are currently in the process of renegotiating our facility on a month to month basis expecting a new agreement in place in the first quarter of in october  nl agreed to loan us up to million 
the amount of our outstanding borrowings from nl at any time is solely at nl s discretion 
we intend to use any borrowings from nl to reduce the outstanding balance under our us revolving bank credit facility 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries  and our ability to service parent level obligations  including the senior secured notes  depends in large part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations or otherwise 
none of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured notes  although kronos international  inc kii  our subsidiary  has pledged of the common stock or other ownership interests of certain of kii s first tier operating subsidiaries as collateral for the senior secured notes 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes limits kii s ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments 
at december   the maximum amount of dividends and other restricted payments that kii could make the restricted payment basket was approximately million 
however  the indenture currently prohibits kii from utilizing such restricted payment basket because kii has not met a specified financial ratio  such prohibition will continue until such time as kii meets the specified financial ratio 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is cash flows from operating activities which is generally used to i fund working capital expenditures  ii repay any short term indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we will also from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  and use the proceeds to i repay existing indebtedness  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact earnings and operating cash flows 
changes in tio pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our dividend policy  our debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in our subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of these steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
in the normal course of our business  we may investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the tio industry 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunity  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing our equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
at december   we had credit available under all of our existing credit facilities of approximately million  consisting principally of million under our european credit facility  million under our canadian credit facility and million under our us credit facility 
based upon our expectation for the tio industry and anticipated demands on cash resources  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our future obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service for the next months 
in this regard  see the discussion above in outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
capital expenditures we intend to spend approximately million to maintain and improve our existing facilities during  including approximately million in the area of environmental protection and compliance 
the majority of our expenditures in will be to maintain our facilities 
we have lowered our planned capital expenditures in in response to the current economic conditions

our contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock contain fixed quantities that we are required to purchase  although certain of these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased  generally no more than  based on our feedstock requirements 
the pricing under these agreements is generally based on a fixed price with price escalation clauses primarily based on consumer price indices  as defined in the respective contracts 
the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to the long term supply contracts for tio feedstock are based upon our current estimate of the quantity of material that will be purchased in each time period shown  the payment that would be due based upon such estimated purchased quantity and an estimate of the effect of the price escalation clause

we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchase  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
defined benefit pension plans we maintain various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  as amended 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the over or under funded status of each of our individual defined benefit pension plans on our consolidated balance sheets 
this standard does not change the existing recognition and measurement requirements that determine the amount of periodic benefit cost we recognize in net income 
we adopted the asset and liability recognition and disclosure requirements of this standard effective december  on a prospective basis  in which we recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income all of our prior unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs or credits  net of tax  as of december  we recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in  and million in in the fourth quarter of we recognized a million pension adjustment in connection with the correction of our pension expense previously recognized for and see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
we made contributions to all of our plans which aggregated million in  million in  and million in the discount rates we use for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive advice about appropriate discount rates from our third party actuaries  who may in some cases use their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each measurement date to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of the measurement date  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
prior to december   we used a september measurement date 
effective december   we began using a december measurement date  concurrent with our adoption of the measurement date requirements of sfas no 
effective december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations related to our plans in germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different discount rate assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligation and expense 
this is because we maintain defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
we used the following discount rates for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in germany canada norway us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested from the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to our plans in the germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense 
this is because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  we consider the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of our plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  we receive advice about appropriate long term rates of return from our third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below in germany  the composition of our plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
in canada  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities and to fixed income securities  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
in norway  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately  and  respectively 
in the us all of the assets were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return has been 
our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows december  cmrt germany canada norway equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate cash  cash equivalents and other total december  cmrt germany canada norway equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate cash  cash equivalents and other total we regularly review our actual asset allocation for each plan  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
our assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany canada norway us we currently expect to use the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as we used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of our plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  we generally base the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of net pension asset and net pension liability will vary based upon relative changes in currency exchange rates 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves or plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
accordingly under gaap  we do not recognize all of such actuarial gains and losses in earnings currently  instead these amounts are deferred and amortized into income in the future as part of net periodic defined benefit pension cost 
however  upon adoption of sfas no 
effective december   these amounts are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in addition  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of our defined benefit pension plans generated a combined net actuarial loss of approximately million 
this actuarial loss resulted primarily from the general overall loss on plan assets in excess of the assumed return 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all plans as of december   our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if we lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of our plans  our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during opeb plans certain subsidiaries of ours in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as amended 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize an asset or liability for the over or under funded status of each of our individual defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans on our consolidated balance sheets 
this standard does not change the existing recognition and measurement requirements that determine the amount of periodic benefit cost we recognize in net income 
we adopted the asset and liability recognition and disclosure requirements of this standard effective december  on a prospective basis  in which we recognized through other comprehensive income all of our prior unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs or credits  net of tax  as of december  we recognized consolidated opeb cost of approximately 
million in and 
million in and similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  
million in and substantially all of our accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents  and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
due to continued increases in healthcare costs  it is expected that our opeb expense for financial reporting purposes will be consistent with the past two years 
our expected opeb benefit payments are expected to be similar amounts 
the assumed discount rates we use for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates we use for our us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider our actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  we have assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our consolidated opeb expense will approximate 
million in in comparison  we expect to be required to make approximately 
million of contributions to such plans during we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  a basis point change in assumed discount rates would have the following effects basis point increase basis point decrease in millions effect on net opeb cost during effect at december  on postretirement obligation assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts we report for health care plans 
a one percent change in assumed health care trend rates would have the following effects increase decrease in millions effect on net opeb cost during effect at december  on postretirement obligation operations outside the united states as discussed above  we have substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of our assets and liabilities related to our non us operations  and therefore our consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   we had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and united kingdom pound sterling 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  substantially all of our aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility that would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for our aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for such non us dollar denominated indebtedness is presented in its non us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of us dollars per euro and 
us dollar per norwegian krone 
certain norwegian krone denominated capital leases totaling million in have been excluded from the table below 
while our note payable to nl is due on demand  our outstanding borrowings under this note were classified as a noncurrent liability at december  because we have the ability and intent to refinance the outstanding amount payable by using borrowing availability under our us revolving credit facility that matures in september see note to our consolidated financial statements

variable rate indebtedness us credit facility at december   us dollar denominated  was million with a weighted average interest rate of 
currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness at december  the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  at december  million 
certain of our sales generated by our non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
we have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
in the fourth quarter of we entered into a series of currency forward contracts and at december  we had currency forward contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates ranging from cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
these contracts with us bank mature from january through december at a rate of million per month 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
an aggregate million for an equivalent value of norwegian kroner at exchange rates ranging from kroner to kroner per us dollar 
these contracts with dnb nor bank asa mature from january through december at a rate of 
million to million per month 
at december   the actual exchange rate was kroner per us dollar 
an aggregate euro million for an equivalent value of norwegian kroner at exchange rates ranging from kroner to kroner per euro 
these contracts with dnb nor bank asa mature from january through december at a rate of euro 
million to euro 
million per month 
at december   the actual exchange rate was kroner per euro 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contracts at december  was a million net liability  which million is recognized as part of prepaid expenses and million is recognized as part of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding million foreign currency transaction loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent we held such contracts during  we did not use hedge accounting for any of our contracts  and we are not using hedge accounting for any of the contracts we entered into in raw materials we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices relating to our raw materials 
as discussed in item we generally enter into long term supply agreements for certain of our raw material requirements including ore 
many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase  although these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased 
raw material pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated annually 
for certain raw material requirements we do not have long term supply agreements either because we have assessed the risk of the unavailability of those raw materials and or the risk of a significant change in the cost of those raw materials to be low  or because long term supply agreements for those raw materials are generally not available 
we do not have any commodity hedges in place at december  other we believe there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect our results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for our products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses we would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by us of future events  gains or losses
