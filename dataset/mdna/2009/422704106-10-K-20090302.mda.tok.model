proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by ore body and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
due to multiple ore metals  and complex combinations of ore types  metal ratios and metallurgical performances at the lucky friday  the cutoff grade is expressed in terms of net smelter return nsr  rather than metal grade 
the cutoff grade at the lucky friday ranges from per ton nsr to per ton nsr 
our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices 
table of contents december  silver per ounce lead per pound zinc per pound reserves are in place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries are expected to be for silver  for lead and for zinc 
zinc recovery has improved from historical levels due to mill upgrades completed during  and the changes in reserves in versus  and in versus  are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work together with increases in forecast metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
during  we initiated engineering  procurement and development activities relating to construction of an internal shaft at the lucky friday mine  which  upon completion  would provide access from the level down to the level in the mine 
this new infrastructure would allow us to mine mineralized material below our current workings on the level  and also provide a deeper exploration platform 
activities for this project thus far have included engineering  purchase of some equipment including hoists and service trucks  and pre development construction from existing workings to the shaft collar  hoist room and other smaller facilities on the level 
however  the project has been placed on hold due to decreases in metals prices during the second half of  allowing time for additional internal study and review of deep access alternatives at the lucky friday 
as a result  the timing and extent of future work on the internal shaft project is uncertain at this time 
ultimate reclamation activities are anticipated to include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas 
no final reclamation activities were performed in  and at december   an asset retirement obligation of approximately million had been recorded for reclamation and closure costs 
the net book value of the lucky friday unit property and its associated plant  equipment and mineral interests was approximately million as of december  the construction of the facilities at lucky friday ranges from the s to  and all are in good physical condition 
in  and  we made capital improvements to our processing plant to improve concentrate grades and metal recoveries 
additions included a three stage crushing system  increased flotation capacity and two new flash cells  new column cells and tailings thickeners  and an on stream analyzer 
the plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside contractors as required 
at december   there were employees at the lucky friday unit 
the united steelworkers of america is the bargaining agent for the lucky friday s hourly employees 
the current labor agreement expires on april  avista corporation supplies electrical power to the lucky friday unit 
exploration properties the san sebastian unit the san sebastian mine is located approximately miles northeast of the city of durango  mexico  on concessions acquired in access to san sebastian is via mexico highway  approximately miles east of guadalupe victoria  and then approximately miles of paved rural road through the towns of ignacio allende and emiliano zapata 
the processing plant  located near velarde a  durango  mexico  was acquired in april the map below illustrates the location and access to the san sebastian unit map our concession holdings cover approximately square miles  including the francine vein  the don sergio vein and multiple outlying active exploration areas 
production from the francine vein was from a high grade silver vein with significant gold credits 
production from the don sergio vein was from a high grade gold vein with some silver credits 
mineral concession titles are obtained and held under the laws of mexico  and are valid for years with the possibility of extending another years 
there are work assessment and tax requirements that are variable and increase with the time that the concession is held 
several intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins occur within the saladillo valley and include the francine  profesor  middle and north vein systems 
these veins are proximal to each other and are hosted within a series of shales with interbedded fine grained sandstones interpreted to belong to the cretaceous caracol formation 
the don sergio  jessica  andrea and antonella veins located in the cerro pedernalillo area  about miles from francine  are end member low sulfidation epithermal veins hosted by the same formation with the addition of dioritic intrusive rocks 
underground development along the francine vein started in may  and reached full production during the second quarter of mining of economic ore on the upper francine vein was completed during the first quarter of the mine has been placed on care and maintenance as exploration continues on the property  including the hugh zone  which is 
table of contents located feet below historic mining 
mining of economic ore on the don sergio vein was completed in the fourth quarter of and reclamation of this portion of the mine site was completed during san sebastian s life of mine production over four years was million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold 
the francine vein strikes northwest and dips southwest  and is located on the southwestern limb of a doubly plunging anticline 
the vein ranges in true thickness from more than feet to less than feet  and consists of several episodes of banded quartz  silica healed breccias and minor amounts of calcite 
the vein is oxidized to a depth of approximately vertical feet and the wall rocks contain an alteration halo of less than feet next to the vein 
mineralization within the oxidized portion of the vein contains limonite  hematite  silver halides and various copper carbonates 
higher grade gold and silver mineralization is associated with disseminated hematite and limonite after pyrite and chalcopyrite  copper carbonates including malachite and azurite and hydrous copper silicates including chrysocolla 
native gold occurs associated with hematite and limonite 
mineralization in the sulfide portion of the francine vein contains pyrite  chalcopyrite  sphalerite  galena  native silver  argentite and trace amounts of aguilarite 
hugh zone mineralization contains chalcopyrite  sphalerite  galena  argentite  acanthite  tetrahedrite  polybasite  stephanite  freibergite  and pyrargyrite 
access to both underground workings has been through ramps from the surface connecting one or more levels 
ore has been mined by the cut and fill stoping method and extracted from the stopes using rubber tired equipment and hauled to the surface in trucks 
run of mine ore has been hauled in trucks by contractors to our processing facility near velarde a  which is approximately miles from the san sebastian mine and miles from the don sergio mine 
the mill  which was constructed in and is capable of processing approximately tons per day  is a conventional leach  counter current decantation and merrill crowe precipitation circuit 
the ore has been crushed in a two stage crushing plant consisting of a primary jaw  a secondary cone crusher and a double deck vibrating screen 
the grinding circuit includes a primary ball mill and cyclone classifiers 
the ground ore was thickened  followed by agitated leaching and four stages of counter current decantation to wash solubilized silver and gold from the pulp 
the solution bearing silver and gold was clarified  deaerated and zinc dust added to precipitate silver and gold that is recovered in plate and frame filters 
the precious metal precipitate was smelted and refined into dor  and was then shipped to a third party refiner 
processing of economic ore was completed during the fourth quarter of  and the mill was placed on care and maintenance at that time 
during  exploration activities were focused in the la roca target area  district scaled soil geochemistry  and district scaled target identification through detailed mapping and sampling 
through this work  several new drillable targets have been identified in the district 
continued district scaled target identification through detailed mapping and sampling is planned during additional exploration at the san sebastian unit during included activity at the rio grande exploration project  which is located approximately miles north of fresnillo in zacatecas state  on concessions acquired under an option to purchase agreement in access to the property is via mexico highway  approximately mile south of the city of rio grande followed by approximately miles of dirt road west to the center of the property 
our rio grande concession holdings cover approximately square miles and several low to intermediate sulfidation epithermal vein systems including the la soledad  arcangeles  el leon  sacramento  concepcion  and san martin vein systems in addition to multiple outlying active exploration areas 
these veins are proximal to each other and are hosted within a series of shales with interbedded fine grained sandstones interpreted to belong to the cretaceous caracol formation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview established in in northern idaho s silver valley  hecla mining company has long been well known in the mining world and financial markets as a quality producer of silver and gold 
headquartered in coeur d alene  idaho  this international  nyse traded company is years old 
our production profile includes silver  gold  lead  and zinc contained in concentrates shipped to various smelters silver and gold dor our operating properties and exploration interests are located in jurisdictions with relatively low political and economic risk in the united states and mexico  and are contained in historically successful mining districts 
we have three business segments for financial reporting purposes the greens creek operating unit on admiralty island in alaska usa  the lucky friday operating unit in idaho usa  and the san sebastian exploration unit in durango  mexico 
our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our production and locating and developing new resource potential 
to implement this framework in  we acquired the remaining interest of the greens creek mine near juneau  alaska  so that we now control of the world s fifth largest silver mine and have almost doubled our annual silver production 
acquired the right to earn in to a joint venture interest in a land package in one of colorado s most prolific silver mining districts 
acquired substantially all of the assets of independence lead mines  thus consolidating of the future profits of the lucky friday mine near mullan  idaho 
sold our subsidiaries engaged in venezuelan mining operations 
following the acquisitions in the us and divestiture of our venezuelan interests  we believe we are positioned as one of the lowest cost  lowest risk producers of precious metals 
subsequent to the acquisitions discussed above we  like many companies  were affected by the global financial crisis 
after opening the year at per ounce  silver rose as high as in the second quarter  but fell at one point as low as in the fourth quarter 
the same volatility affected our important by products as well  with lead and zinc at the end of the fourth quarter selling for approximately one third of their high points in the first quarter 
the economic downturn affected not only our earnings  but also our stock price  which fell from its one day high point of in the second quarter to its one day low of in the fourth quarter  rebounding to at the end of the year 
with a high level of volatility in both our earnings and share price  our ability to raise capital to retire debt was affected 
nevertheless  of the total million purchase price of greens creek  we had just million in debt outstanding between our bridge and term loan credit facilities at year end 
we extended  to february  the final million payment of the bridge loan and rescheduled all term loan payments initially scheduled for and totaling million to and we increased our production of silver to million ounces in  up from million ounces in production of lead and zinc  important by products at our lucky friday and greens creek mines  also increased in  with production of lead higher by and zinc by due to our acquisition of the remaining interest in greens creek 
however  gold production declined in compared to while the greens creek acquisition increased domestic gold production  this increase was more than offset by the sale of our mining interests in venezuela  and we no longer operate a primary gold mine as a result of the sale 
revenues increased by from to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest in greens creek  in spite of lower lead and zinc prices 
we reported a loss of in compared to earnings in of per diluted share 
gross profit from operations declined from million in to million in as a result of lower by product lead and zinc prices  higher operating costs  and valuation of in process inventory associated with the greens creek joint venture acquisition 
our commitment to exploration and pre development in was million higher than in  however  at the same time  
table of contents we reduced general and administrative expense by million 
we recorded a gain of million on sale of investments versus a gain of million on asset sales in  and while in we recognized a benefit from a decreased valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  we have recorded a provision in as a result of declining metals prices 
further affecting earnings per common share  dividends on preferred shares totaled million in  up from million in as a result of our december issuance of  shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock 
the factors driving metals prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
as noted above  prices were highly volatile in average prices in compared to those in and are illustrated in the results of operations section below 
key issues our strategy to increase production and expand our proven and probable reserves will be achieved through development and exploration  as well as by future acquisitions 
our strategic plan requires that we overcome several pervasive challenges and risks inherent in conducting mining  development  exploration and metal sales at multiple locations 
one such risk involves metals prices 
while the metals mining industry enjoyed continued strength in metals prices from through mid  we have no control over prices 
as noted above  silver  lead and zinc prices in were highly volatile  and ended the year significantly lower than in the first and second quarters 
we must make our strategic plans in the context of significant uncertainty about future revenues  which is a daunting challenge to an industry for which new opportunities can require many years and substantial cost from discovery to production 
we approach this challenge by investing exploration and capital in districts with an established history of success  and in managing our operations in a manner that seeks to mitigate the effects of lower prices 
the recent unprecedented volatility in global financial markets poses a significant challenge to our ability to access credit and equity markets and to sell our products at a profit 
while we have seen our share price rebound from its lowest levels in and have been successful in marketing our equity  we have deferred certain loan payments to and and the terms of our credit facilities could restrict our current and future operations 
another challenge is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities may change in the future  affecting our strategic plans 
in accordance with our environmental policy  our operating activities will be conducted in a manner that attempts to minimize risks to public health and safety 
we attempt to design and manage our projects in an attempt to reasonably minimize risk and negative effects on the environment 
we intend to continue to strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
reserve estimation is a major risk inherent in mining 
our reserve estimates  which drive our mining and investment plans and many of our costs  may change based on economic factors and actual production experience 
until ore is actually mined and processed  the volumes and grades of our reserves must be considered as estimates 
our reserves are depleted as we mine 
reserves can also change as a result of changes in economic and operating assumptions 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a loss applicable to common shareholders of million compared to income applicable to common shareholders of million in and million in the following factors led to the reduced results for the year ended december  compared to and decreased gross profit at our greens creek and lucky friday units see the greens creek segment and lucky friday segment sections below for further discussion of operating results

valuation allowance adjustments to our deferred tax asset balances resulted in a million net income tax provision recognized in compared to million and million income tax benefits recognized in and resulting from valuation allowance adjustments 
we recorded a net increase to our deferred tax assets in by approximately million due the addition of a million net deferred tax asset relating to the purchase of the remaining of greens creek  partially offset by reductions of million due to the sale of our venezuelan operations and million due a decrease in the estimated future utilization of deferred tax assets see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
preferred stock dividends of million for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively  for and  due to the issuance of  shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock in december the net proceeds from the preferred stock issuance were utilized for the purchase of the remaining interest in the greens creek joint venture 
decreased average prices for zinc produced at our operations in compared to and  and decreased average prices for lead produced at our operations in compared to  as illustrated by the following table december  silver london pm fix ounce realized price per ounce gold london pm fix ounce realized price per ounce lead lme final cash buyer pound realized price per pound zinc lme final cash buyer pound realized price per pound the differences between realized metal prices and average market prices are due to the difference between metal prices upon transfer of title of concentrates to the buyer and final settlement 
for  we reported negative adjustments to provisional settlements of million compared to negative adjustments of to provisional settlements of million in and positive adjustments of million in other significant variances affecting the comparison of our operating results to results for and were as follows an increase of million in in our estimated liabilities for environmental remediation in idaho s coeur d alene basin and the bunker hill superfund site 
during the second quarter of  we finalized a proposed multi year clean up plan for the upper portion of the coeur d alene basin  together with an estimate of related costs to implement the plan 
based on that work and a reassessment of our other potential liabilities in the basin  we increased our accrual for remediation in the basin by million 
we also accrued an additional million for the remaining bunker hill superfund site work 
for additional discussion  see bunker hill superfund site and coeur d alene river basin environmental claims in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we committed to a donation of our common stock valued at million in for the creation of hecla charitable foundation  an organization that will fund charitable contributions in the communities in which hecla holds mining interests

the decrease in gross profit during compared to and was primarily the result of the following factors higher cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  which increased to in compared to in and in the higher cost of sales in is primarily due to increased costs of diesel fuel and other consumables  and an adjustment for the fair value of the finished and in process product inventory acquired upon purchase of the ownership interest 
upon the sale of the acquired inventory  the fair market value was expensed  which increased cost of sales and decreased gross profit margin in higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  as a percentage of sales  as a result of the fair market valuation of the acquired share of property  plant  equipment and mineral interests at the acquisition date 
lower silver ore grades in compared to and a decline in average zinc and lead prices 
average zinc prices for were lower than those for and  while average lead prices have declined from their levels 
negative price adjustments to revenues of million in as a result of declines in metal prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the year 
the greens creek operation is partially powered by diesel generators  and production costs have been significantly affected by increasing fuel prices in and infrastructure has been installed that allows hydroelectric power to be supplied to greens creek by alaska electric light and power company ael p  via a submarine cable from north douglas island  near juneau  to admiralty island  where greens creek is located 
it is anticipated that this project will reduce production costs at greens creek 
ael p had agreed to supply surplus power to greens creek  however  supply has been hampered by low reservoir water supplies and high power demand in the juneau vicinity 

table of contents the increase in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is due to lower zinc and lead prices  lower silver ore grades and increased operating costs 
the improvement in total cash costs per silver ounce in compared to is attributable to increased by product credits  as lead and gold prices exceeded prices during the same period  partially offset by higher production costs 
while value from zinc  lead and gold by products is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery  the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver  and in most of its working areas  greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc  lead and gold to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset operating costs

the million decrease in gross profit in compared to resulted primarily from lower average lead and zinc prices  higher operating costs  and silver ore grades that decreased by 
in addition  negative price adjustments to revenues of million impacted results for due to declines in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlement during the year 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was due primarily to higher average silver and lead prices and increased production  partially offset by lower ore grades 
the increase in total cash costs per silver ounce in compared to and is attributed to lower silver ore grades  higher mining and milling costs  and declining lead and zinc prices 
mining at longer strike lengths at the lucky friday allowed us to take advantage of the high base metals prices experienced in and the first half of and the 
table of contents mill s ability to recover more zinc due to recent mill upgrades 
this resulted in an economic benefit and allowed us to temporarily mine lower silver grade ore that was below anticipated life of mine reserve levels  which also delayed some production of metals included in the reserve to later periods 
while value from lead and zinc is significant at the lucky friday  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with zinc and lead as by products  is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production  and the lucky friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc and lead to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset operating costs 
the san sebastian segment we reached the end of the known mine life on the francine and don sergio veins at the san sebastian unit located in mexico during the fourth quarter of however  significant exploration efforts have continued during   and at the hugh zone and other exploration targets located on or near the san sebastian property  where we now hold square miles of contiguous concessions 
concessions totaling square miles were added to our land package at the san sebastian segment during the first quarter of additional exploration activity at the san sebastian unit in and has included completion of initial drilling on a number of veins at our rio grande project  where our concession holdings cover approximately square miles 
we incurred million in exploration expenses during at san sebastian compared to million in and million in the san sebastian mine and velarde a mill have been on care and maintenance status as we continue exploration efforts

total cash costs provide management and investors an indication of net cash flow  after consideration of the realized price received for production sold 
management also uses this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period to period from a cash flow perspective 
total cash cost per ounce is a measure developed by gold companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard  however  there can be no assurance that our reporting of this non gaap measure is similar to that reported by other mining companies 
cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to total cash costs

cash held in foreign currencies decreased in the second quarter as we exchanged venezuelan bol vares valued at approximately million at the official exchange rate for approximately million at the open market exchange rate  incurring a loss on the difference  and now hold nominal balances in canadian dollars and mexican pesos 
the decrease in the value of our current marketable equity securities during resulted from our sale of million shares of great basin gold  inc stock in the second quarter 
the decrease in our non current marketable equity securities in was due to changes in the market values of the securities  partially off set by the receipt of  shares of common stock of rusoro mining ltd

as discussed further below  a portion of the greens creek acquisition was funded by million provided by a bridge loan which initially matured on october  an additional million was provided by the bridge loan for general corporate purposes 
in september and october  we repaid million of the million balance outstanding on the loan  leaving a balance of million  which was extended to february   subject to conditions as discussed in note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
an additional million was funded by a three year term facility maturing in  of which the first payment of million was made on september   and for which another million scheduled for payment on december  was moved to february  on february   we reached an agreement to amend the terms of our current credit facilities to defer all term facility principal payments due in  totaling million  to and in addition  on february   we entered into an agreement to sell million units comprised of one share of common stock and one half series warrant to purchase one share of common stock in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of approximately million

table of contents payment of our outstanding bridge facility balance on february  in accordance with the credit facilities  we also reduced our term loan by approximately million in february see note subsequent events of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the credit facilities amendment and offering 
we estimate that approximately million of cash flow will be invested in capital expenditures through the end of we also may pursue additional acquisition opportunities  which would require additional equity issuances or financing 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available to us 
year ended december cash provided by operating activities in millions the lower cash provided by operating activities in compared to the period resulted primarily from lower cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  which totaled million in compared to million in the million decrease was a result of million reduction in income from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items resulting from lower metals prices and higher costs  partly offset by a million increase in cash resulting from changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable  inventories  and other assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was also impacted by increased losses from discontinued operations  including foreign exchange losses totaling million incurred on exchange of venezuelan bol vares for us dollars as described above 
in total  losses on discontinued operations in exceeded those in by million 
cash provided by operating activities were higher in than in by million as a result of higher cash generated by continuing operations adjusted for non cash items and million increase in cash from accounts receivable  accounts payable  inventories  and other assets and liabilities  partly offset by million lower cash from discontinued operations 
year ended december cash used in provided by investing activities in millions cash used in investing activities was higher in than in primarily as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest in the greens creek joint venture from rio tinto  plc for million net of cash acquired  along with hecla stock valued at approximately million 
in addition  we invested million of cash in property  plant  equipment  and mineral interests in  up from million in  and an additional million for non cash acquisition of properties paid for with the hecla stock 
the increased capital investment at our lucky friday unit was primarily for sustaining capital that will facilitate extension of our mine plan to deeper levels and a new tailings disposal area 
capital investment at the greens creek unit  of which our subsidiaries have owned since april   was for sustaining capital that will modernize communications and the hauling fleet  and additional tailings capacity 
discontinued operations provided million more cash in  while other investing activities yielded million less cash in than in cash provided by investing activities in exceeded cash provided in s level by million as a result of liquidation of short term investments held at the end of and lower cash requirements for discontinued operations  offset partly by higher capitalized costs in and million less cash flow from sales of investments and properties 
year ended december cash used in provided by financing activities in millions significant financing activities in included the receipt of million related to the amended credit agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in the greens creek joint venture as described in critical accounting estimates business combinations  the sale of million shares of our common stock for proceeds  net of related fees  of million in september  and the sale of million shares for net proceeds of million in december 
in september  we repaid million on our debt million on our term loan  as scheduled  and million on our bridge loan  and in october we repaid an additional million on our bridge loan 
the primary use of cash for financing activities beyond loan payments was the payment of dividends on series b and mandatory convertible

we were required to pay million in dividends on preferred shares in compared to million in in  million was received from the sale of shares issued under our stock option plans 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  in contrast to cash used in of million  due primarily to our sale of  shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock in which yielded million 
proceeds from stock option exercises in were higher than in by million as more options were exercised due to higher stock prices in the current year  and in  we repaid our million balance on our revolving loan facility  while in  the facility carried no balance 
acquisition of the greens creek joint venture on april   we completed our acquisition of the remaining of the greens creek joint venture from a subsidiary of rio tinto 
we have been a partner in the joint venture for approximately years 
the interest was acquired for million cash million net of cash received and million shares of hecla common stock  which was valued at million 
the million in cash paid to rio tinto included million in proceeds from a bridge financing which was originally scheduled to mature in october  a million three year amortizing term loan facility scheduled to mature on march   and million in cash which we held prior to closing 
we utilized an additional million available for general corporate purposes from the bridge facility in september see cash used in provided by financing activities for information on the service of our debt facility obligations and equity issuances in related to the acquisition of the remaining of greens creek 
on february   we reached an agreement to amend the terms of our current credit facilities to defer all term facility principal payments due in  totaling million  to and in addition  on february   we entered into an agreement to sell million units comprised of one share of common stock and one half series warrant to purchase one share of common stock in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of approximately million

there are a number of factors that may impact our future ability to meet the obligations of our debt facility 
if the volumes or the market prices for the metals we produce are inadequate or we fail to control our production  development or corporate costs for a sustained period of time  our ability to service our debt obligations may be adversely affected 
our cash and investment balances and cash flows from operations may not be adequate to meet our obligations  and we may be required to obtain additional cash through asset sales or the potential addition of new debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that these cash sources will be available to us 
see the discussion of future metals prices in the critical accounting estimates and discussion of the various risks associated with our credit facilities in item a

table of contents contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the table below presents our fixed  non cancelable contractual obligations and commitments primarily related to our outstanding purchase orders  certain capital expenditures  our credit facilities as modified by amendments  and lease arrangements as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total purchase obligations long term debt contractual obligations operating lease commitments total contractual cash obligations consist of open purchase orders of approximately million at the greens creek unit and million at the lucky friday unit 
included in these amounts are approximately million and million related to various capital projects at the greens creek and lucky friday units  respectively 
obligations due in less than one year are comprised of million in principal  million in interest and million in fees relating to our bridge credit facility and million in principal and in estimated interest on our term credit facilitiy 
obligations due in one to three years include million in scheduled term facility principal payments and million in estimated interest 
for more information on our credit facilities  see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we were committed to approximately million for various capital projects at the greens creek and lucky friday units 
total contractual obligations at december  also include approximately million for commitments relating to non capital items at greens creek 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
on april   we completed the acquisition of the remaining of the greens creek mine 
accordingly  our obligations relating to open purchase orders  capital projects  transportation and other non capital cost commitments  and all other items relating to greens creek reflect our ownership  versus historically 
for more information on the acquisition  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on june   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell of our wholly owned subsidiaries holding our business and operations in venezuela  and the transaction closed on july  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the sale 
as a result  our obligations relating to the discontinued la camorra unit for open purchase orders  transportation and other non capital commitments  and future royalty obligations were eliminated upon completion of the sale 
within the area mined by lucky friday  we previously controlled the gold hunter property under a long term operating agreement with independence lead mines company independence scheduled to expire in february and renewable thereafter  that entitled us  as operator  to an interest in the net profits from operations from the gold hunter property 
under that agreement  we would have been obligated to pay a net profits interest of to independence after we recouped our costs to explore and develop the property 
recoupment depended on  among other factors  metals prices and the extent of capital invested in lucky friday 
on november   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of independence  resulting in our ownership of the property  thus eliminating our obligation to outside third parties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the transaction 
we maintain reserves for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our reserves for these matters totaled million  for which no contractual or commitment obligations exist 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will make expenditures relating to these obligations over the next years 
for additional information relating to our environmental obligations  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic  political  regulatory  and other factors that affect our business prospects 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  mineral reserves  and accounting for business combinations  as they require us to make assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical 
however  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
future metals prices metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities  including properties  plants and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accounts receivable 
as shown under item a 
risk factors  metals prices have been historically volatile 
while average prices for silver and gold have performed favorably for five consecutive years  there has been a reduction in the average prices for zinc and lead in compared to we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices in the past  and we can offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase 
processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analyses of asset carrying values  depreciation  and deferred income taxes 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant we examine the carrying values of our assets  our depreciation rates  and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
in our analyses of carrying values and deferred taxes  we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model  including current prices  analyst price estimates  forward curve prices  and historical prices see mineral reserves  below  regarding prices used for reserve estimates 
using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets  we use the average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated  and to determine the level of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
in addition  estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions see business combinations below 
sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at estimated forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed from shipment to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues and accounts receivable previously recorded upon shipment 
as a result  our trade accounts receivable balances are subject to changes in metals prices until final settlement occurs 
for more information  see part o 
revenue recognition of note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
obligations for environmental  reclamation and closure matters the most significant liability on our balance sheet is for accrued reclamation and closure costs 
we have conducted considerable remediation work at sites in the united states for which remediation requirements have not been fully determined  nor have they been agreed between us and various regulatory agencies with oversight over the properties 
we have estimated our liabilities with counsel and in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if warranted management reviews our liabilities with our audit committee 
however  the range of liability proposed by the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings considerably exceeds the liabilities we have recognized 
if substantial damages were awarded or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
mineral reserves critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves 
our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices  as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade  accessibility and production cost 
metals prices are estimated at long term averages  as described in item property descriptions 
our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually  and periodically utilizes external audits 

table of contents reserves are a key component in valuation of our properties  plants and equipment 
reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units of production depreciation  with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves 
reserves are also a key component in forecasts  with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values to ensure that carrying values are reported appropriately 
reserves also play a key role in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions see business combinations below 
reserves are a culmination of many estimates and not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals 
business combinations in accordance with sfas  business combinations  we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date 
we would recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets  less liabilities  as goodwill 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived assets  including estimates of future metals prices and mineral reserves  as discussed above 
in some cases  we use third party appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and other identifiable assets

forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis  as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this form k  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby 
see the discussion in special note on forward looking statements included prior to part i  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  as well as summarizes the financial instruments held by us at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices and are not held for trading purposes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable see part i  item a 
risk factors 
short term investments from time to time we hold various types of short term investments that are subject to changes in market interest rates and are sensitive to those changes 
we did not carry any such short term investments as of december  commodity price risk management at times  we use commodity forward sales commitments  commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce 
contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by offsetting market exposures 
we had no commodity related derivative positions at december  interest rate risk management at december   we had million in debt associated with the acquisition of the remaining of the greens creek mine 
the debt consists of million related to a three year amortizing term facility maturing on march  and a million bridge facility balance maturing on february  on may   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the libor based variable interest obligations associated with our term facility 
as a result  the interest payable related to million if the million term facility balance at december  is fixed at a rate of until maturity on march   in accordance with the amortization schedule of the amended and restated credit agreement dated april  as a result of an amendment to the facility in december to defer the million principal payment originally due on december  to february   the terms of the interest rate swap agreement and the note that the swap agreement pertains to did not match at december  with regards to the maturity date of the million payment  with the hedge being slightly ineffective as a result 
the fair value of the swap at december  was a liability of million 
the accumulated unrealized loss at december  related to the swap was million at december   and we realized a hedging loss of million in related to the ineffective portion of the swap 
we are accounting for this swap as a hedge pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the unrealized loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet and the realized loss is included in interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations  with the fair value payable included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
for additional information regarding our credit facilities  see note and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents on february   we reached an agreement to amend the terms of our credit facilities to defer all principal payments due on our term facility in  totaling million  to and as a result of the amendment  the original hedging relationship was de designated  and a new hedging relationship was designated 
a retrospective hedge effectiveness test was performed on the original hedging relationship at the date of de designation  and the original hedging relationship was determined to be ineffective 
consequently  the change in fair value of the swap of million between december  and february  was recorded as a gain on the income statement 
the amount of unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to the original hedge will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged interest payments occur 
provisional sales sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters  including by product metals  are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at estimated forward prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed from shipment to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment 
our concentrate sales are based on a provisional sales price containing an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes 
the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at the time of the sale 
the embedded derivative  which does not qualify for hedge accounting  is adjusted to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control see item a risk factors a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for more information 
at december   metals contained in concentrates and exposed to future price changes totaled  ounces of silver   ounces of gold   tons of zinc  and  tons of lead
