item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
introduction  outlook and overview of business operations we view our current business as comprised of the following four business segments domestic xtrac  international dermatology equipment  skin care procyte  and surgical products 
domestic xtrac our domestic xtrac segment is a us business with revenues primarily derived from procedures performed by dermatologists 
we are engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of our proprietary xtrac excimer laser and delivery systems and techniques used in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders  including psoriasis  vitiligo  atopic dermatitis and leukoderma 
as part of our commercialization strategy in the united states  we offer the xtrac laser system to targeted dermatologists at no initial capital cost 
under this contractual arrangement  we maintain ownership of the laser and earn revenue each time a physician treats a patient with the equipment 
we believe this arrangement will increase market penetration 
at times  however  we sell the laser directly to the customer for certain reasons  including the costs of logistical support and customer preference as well as a means of addressing under performing accounts while still preserving a vendor customer relationship 
we are finding that through sales of lasers we are able to reach  at reasonable margins  a sector of the market that is better suited to a sale model than a per procedure model 
for the last several years we have sought to obtain health insurance coverage for xtrac laser therapy to treat inflammatory skin disease  particularly psoriasis 
with the addition of new positive payment policies from blue cross blue shield plans from certain states in  we now benefit from the fact that  estimatedly  more than of the insured united states population has policies that provide nearly full reimbursement for the treatment of psoriasis by means of an excimer laser 
we are now focusing our efforts on accelerating the adoption of the xtrac laser therapy for psoriasis and vitiligo by doctors and patients 
consequently  we have increased the size of our sales force and clinical technician personnel together with increased expenditures for marketing and advertising 
our person xtrac sales organization includes sales representatives  clinical specialists and marketing support personnel 
our person skin care sales organization includes sales representatives  customer service representatives and marketing support personnel 
the sales representatives in each segment provide follow up sales support and share sales leads to enhance opportunities for cross selling 
our marketing department has been instrumental in expanding the advertising campaign for the xtrac laser system 
we have tried various direct to consumer marketing programs that have positively influenced utilization  but the increase in utilization is expected to be attained in periods subsequent to the period in which we incurred the expense 
we have also increased the number of sales representatives and established a group of clinical support specialists to optimize utilization levels and better secure the willingness and interest of patients to seek follow up courses of treatment after the effect of the first battery of treatment sessions starts to wear off 
we have recently promoted a regional sales director in the domestic xtrac segment to head up xtrac marketing operations  with the aim of helping our less successful customers emulate the business and clinical methods of our more successful customers 
international dermatology equipment in the international market  we derive revenues by selling our dermatology laser and lamp systems and replacement parts to distributors and directly to physicians 
in this market  we have benefited from both our clinical studies and from the improved reliability and functionality of the xtrac laser system 
compared to the domestic segment  the sales of laser and lamp systems in the international segment are influenced to a greater degree by competition from similar laser technologies as well as non laser lamp alternatives 
over time  this competition has reduced the prices we are able to charge to international distributors for our xtrac products 
to compete with other non laser uvb products  we offer a lower priced  lamp based system called the vtrac 
we expanded the international marketing of the vtrac since its introduction in the vtrac is used to treat psoriasis and vitiligo 
skin care procyte the skin care segment generates revenues primarily from the sale of skin health  hair care and wound care products 
in prior periods  the sale of copper peptide compound in bulk  and royalties on licenses for the patented copper peptide compound were a significant factor in our revenues 
procyte s focus has been to provide unique products  primarily based upon patented technologies for selected applications in the dermatology  plastic and cosmetic surgery and medical spa markets 
procyte has also expanded the use of its novel copper peptide technologies into the mass retail market for skin and hair care through targeted technology licensing and supply agreements 
procyte s products are aimed at the growing demand for skin health and hair care products  including products to enhance appearance and address the effects of aging on skin and hair 
procyte s products are formulated  branded and targeted at specific markets 
procyte s initial products addressed the dermatology  plastic and cosmetic surgery markets for use after various procedures 
anti aging skin care products were added to offer a comprehensive approach for a patient s skin care regimen 
surgical products the surgical products segment generates revenues by selling laser products and disposables to hospitals and surgery centers both inside and outside of the united states 
also included are various non laser surgical products eg the clearess ii suction irrigation system 
we believe that sales of surgical laser systems and the related disposable base will tend to erode as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
we are working to offset such erosion by increasing sales from the diode surgical laser  including oem arrangements 
sales to angiodynamics as discussed below helped increase surgical products sales in in september  we entered into a three year oem agreement with angiodynamics under which we manufacture for angiodynamics  on a non exclusive basis  a private label  nanometer diode laser system 
the oem agreement provides that we shall supply this laser on an exclusive basis to angiodynamics  should angiodynamics meet certain purchase requirements 
through september  shipments to angiodynamics exceeded the minimum purchase requirement for delivery of lasers over the first contract year and therefore triggered exclusivity for worldwide sale in the peripheral vascular treatment field 
recently  however  angiodynamics purchased the assets of a competitive diode laser company  and if it elects to source its diodes through the assets so purchased  our future sales of diode lasers to angiodynamics under this exclusive arrangement may be severely limited 
there were no shipments to angiodynamics in the last six months ended december  sale of surgical services business surgical services was a fee based procedures business using mobile surgical laser equipment operated by our technicians at hospitals and surgery centers in the united states 
we decided to sell this division primarily because the growth rates and operating margins of the division have decreased as the business had changed to rely more heavily upon procedures performed using equipment from third party suppliers  thereby limiting the profit potential of these services 
after preliminary investigations and discussions  our board of directors decided  with the aid of its investment banker  on june  to enter into substantive  confidential discussions with potential third party buyers and began to develop plans for implementing a disposal of the assets and operations of the business 
on august   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell specific assets of the business including accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  for  subject to certain closing adjustments 
the sale closed on august  and such closing adjustments resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
acquisition of the subsidiaries of ptl on february   we completed the acquisition of ptl  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the initial purchase price of million paid at closing ptl closing  and under an earn out provision  up to an additional million of consideration may be paid to the sellers if certain gross profit milestones are met by the acquired ptl business between july  and june   subject to customary adjustments 
the acquisition was funded through a convertible debt investment of million from the investor that closed simultaneously with the ptl closing 
the convertible note transaction financed the million purchase price of the acquisition  and a further million in working capital at the closing of the acquisition 
under the terms of the investment  the investor will make up to an additional million convertible debt investment in photomedex in the event the additional consideration is payable under the terms of the ptl acquisition 
after the payment of approximately million of transaction expenses associated with the acquisition and the debt investment  we will have approximately million remaining for use as working capital 
at the ptl closing  in exchange for the investor s payment to us of a purchase price of million  we issued the investor i a note in the principal amount of million and ii a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
at the ptl closing  we also paid the investor a transaction fee of  in cash 
in addition  at the ptl closing we and the investor entered into that certain pledge and security agreement the security agreement 
as security for our obligations to the investor under the spa and the notes  we granted the investor a first priority security interest in i all of the stock of a procyte corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary  and b photo therapeutics  inc  which became our wholly owned subsidiary at the pt closing  ii of the stock of photo therapeutics limited  which also became our wholly owned subsidiary of the company at the ptl closing  and iii certain other assets of the company 
reverse stock split on january   we completed the reverse split of its common stock in the ratio of for our common stock began trading at the market opening on january  on a split adjusted basis 
the reverse split is intended to enable us to increase our marketability to institutional investors and to maintain our listing on the nasdaq  among other benefits 
as a result of the stock split  we now has  shares of common stock outstanding  taking into account the rounding up of fractional shares 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  impairment of property and equipment and of intangibles and accruals for warranty claims 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with these policies have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition xtrac related operations we have two distribution channels for our phototherapy treatment equipment 
we either i sell the laser through a distributor or directly to a physician or ii place the laser in a physician s offices at no charge to the physician and charge the physician a fee for an agreed upon number of treatments 
in some cases  we and the customer stipulate to a quarterly target of procedures to be performed 
when we sell an xtrac laser to a distributor or directly to a foreign or domestic physician  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria under staff accounting bulletin no 
have been met i the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable the sab criteria 
at times  units are shipped  but revenue is not recognized until all of the sab criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
we ship most of our products fob shipping point  although from time to time certain customers  for example governmental customers  will insist upon fob destination 
among the factors we take into account in determining the proper time at which to recognize revenue are when title to the goods transfers and when the risk of loss transfers 
shipments to distributors or physicians that do not fully satisfy the collection criteria are recognized when invoiced amounts are fully paid or assured 
under the terms of our distributor agreements  distributors do not have a unilateral right to return any unit that they have purchased 
however  we do allow products to be returned  under warranty  by our distributors for product defects or other claims 
when we place a laser in a physician s office  we recognize service revenue based on the number of patient treatments performed by the physician 
treatments in the form of random laser access codes that are sold to physicians  but not yet used  are deferred and recognized as a liability until the physician performs the treatment 
unused treatments remain an obligation of ours because the treatments can only be performed on our equipment 
once the treatments are delivered to a patient  this obligation has been satisfied 
we exclude all sales of treatment codes made within the last two weeks of the period in determining the number of procedures performed by our physician customers 
our management believes this approach closely approximates the actual number of unused treatments that existed at the end of a period 
for the years ended december  and  we deferred  and  respectively  under this approach 
skin care operations we generate revenues from our skin care business primarily through product sales for skin health  hair care and wound care 
sales in bulk of the copper peptide compound  and royalties related thereto  are no longer a significant factor in our revenues 
we recognize revenues on the products and copper peptide compound when they are shipped  net of returns and allowances 
we ship the products fob shipping point 
surgical products and service operations we generate revenues from our surgical business primarily from product sales of laser systems  related maintenance service agreements  recurring laser delivery systems and laser accessories 
we recognize revenues from surgical laser and other product sales  including sales to distributors and other customers  when the sab criteria have been met 
revenue from maintenance service agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreements 
revenue from billable services  including repair activity  is recognized when the service is provided 
inventory 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost is determined to be purchased cost for raw materials and the production cost materials  labor and indirect manufacturing cost for work in process and finished goods 
throughout the laser manufacturing process  the related production costs are recorded within inventory 
work in process is immaterial  given the typically short manufacturing cycle  and therefore is disclosed in conjunction with raw materials 
we perform full physical inventory counts for xtrac and cycle counts on the other inventory to maintain controls and obtain accurate data 
our xtrac laser is either i sold to distributors or physicians directly or ii placed in a physician s office and remains our property 
the cost to build a laser  whether for sale or for placement  is accumulated in inventory 
when a laser is placed in a physician s office  the cost is transferred from inventory to lasers in service within property and equipment 
at times  units are shipped to distributors  but revenue is not recognized until all of the sab criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
revenue is not recognized from these distributors until payment is either assured or paid in full 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves periodically based on forecasted sales and market trends 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the majority of receivables related to phototherapy sales are due from various distributors located outside of the united states and from physicians located inside the united states 
the majority of receivables related to skincare products and surgical products are due from various customers and distributors located inside the united states 
from time to time  our customers dispute the amounts due to us  and  in other cases  our customers experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on a timely basis 
in certain instances  these factors ultimately result in uncollectible accounts 
the determination of the appropriate reserve needed for uncollectible accounts involves significant judgment 
such factors include changes in the financial condition of our customers as a result of industry  economic or customer specific factors 
a change in the factors used to evaluate collectability could result in a significant change in the reserve needed 
property and equipment 
as of december  and  we had net property and equipment of  and  respectively 
the most significant component of these amounts relates to the xtrac lasers placed by us in physicians offices 
we own the equipment and charge the physician on a per treatment basis for use of the equipment 
the recoverability of the net carrying value of the lasers is predicated on continuing revenues from the physicians use of the lasers 
if the physician does not generate sufficient treatments  then we may remove the laser from the physician s office and redeploy elsewhere 
as a result of their improved reliability  xtrac lasers placed in service after december  are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of five years  other xtrac lasers in service were depreciated over the original useful life of three years 
for other property and equipment  including property and equipment acquired from procyte  depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  primarily three to seven years for computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  automobiles  and machinery and equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or lease terms 
useful lives are determined based upon an estimate of either physical or economic obsolescence  or both 
intangibles 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on various factors  including market conditions and operational performance of our business 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  of goodwill and other intangibles  accounting for and of our total assets at the respective dates 
the goodwill is not amortizable  the other intangibles are 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we test our goodwill for impairment  at least annually 
this test is usually conducted in december of each year in connection with the annual budgeting and forecast process 
also  on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether events have occurred that would negatively impact the realizable value of our intangibles or goodwill 
there has been no change in and to the carrying value of goodwill that is allocated to the xtrac domestic segment and the international dermatology equipment segment 
in connection with the acquisition of procyte on march   we acquired certain intangibles recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and allocated them fully to the skin care procyte segment 
as of december   the neutrogena agreement was reduced to its fair value of the balances of these acquired intangibles  net of amortization  were december  procyte neutrogena agreement procyte customer relationships procyte tradename procyte developed technologies goodwill total deferred income taxes 
we have a deferred tax asset that is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
we have not recognized the deferred tax asset  given our historical losses and the lack of certainty of future taxable income 
however  if and when we become profitable and can reasonably foresee continuing profitability  then under sfas no 
we may recognize some of the deferred tax asset 
the recognized portion may variously reduce acquired goodwill  increase stockholders equity directly and or benefit the statement of operations 
warranty accruals 
we establish a liability for warranty repairs based on estimated future claims for xtrac systems and based on historical analysis of the cost of the repairs for surgical laser systems 
however  future returns of defective laser systems and related warranty liability could differ significantly from estimates  and historical patterns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
results of operations revenues the following table illustrates revenues from our four business segments for the periods listed below for the year ended december  dermatology xtrac domestic services international dermatology equipment products skin care procyte products total dermatology revenues surgical surgical products total surgical revenues total revenues revenues from our surgical services segment  in the amount of  through august   the date of sale  have been accounted for in as a discontinued operation 
revenues from our surgical services segment were  and  for the years ended december  and were reclassified to discontinued operations 
domestic xtrac segment recognized treatment revenue for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively  reflecting billed procedures of   and  respectively 
in addition    and  procedures were performed for the years ended december   and  respectively  without billing from us  in connection with clinical research and customer evaluations of the xtrac laser 
the increase in procedures in the year ended december  compared to the same periods in and was largely related to our continuing progress in securing favorable reimbursement policies from private insurance plans and to our increased marketing programs 
increases in procedures are dependent upon building market acceptance through marketing programs with our physician partners and their patients that the xtrac procedures will be of clinical benefit and be generally reimbursed 
we have a program to support certain physicians who may be denied reimbursement by private insurance carriers for xtrac treatments 
in accordance with the requirements of sab no 
 we recognize service revenue during this program from the sale of xtrac procedures or equivalent treatments to physicians participating in this program only to the extent the physician has been reimbursed for the treatments 
for the year ended december   we deferred revenues of   procedures net  under this program  compared to deferred revenues of   procedures net  under this program for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we deferred revenues of   procedures net  under this program 
the change in deferred revenue under this program is presented in the table below 
for the years ended december  and  domestic xtrac laser sales were  and  respectively 
there were and lasers sold  respectively 
included in the year ended december  laser sales was a sale of one omnilux product from ptl for which we have been acting as a distributor in the united states 
there were xtrac lasers sold for the year ended december  for a total of  laser sales have been made for various reasons  including costs of logistical support and customer preferences 
we are finding that through sales of lasers we are able to reach  at reasonable margins  a sector of the market that is better suited to a sale model than a per procedure model 
the following table illustrates the above analysis for the domestic xtrac segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  total revenue less laser sales revenue recognized treatment revenue change in deferred program revenue change in deferred unused treatments net billed treatment revenue procedure volume total less non billed procedures net billed procedures avg 
price of treatments sold procedures with deferred program revenue  net procedures with deferred unused treatments  net the average price for a treatment may be reduced in some instances based on the volume of treatments performed 
the average price for a treatment also varies based upon the mix of mild and moderate psoriasis patients treated by our physician partners 
we charge a higher price per treatment for moderate psoriasis patients due to the increased body surface area required to be treated  although there are fewer patients with moderate psoriasis than there are with mild psoriasis 
international dermatology equipment segment international sales of our xtrac and vtrac systems and related parts were  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we sold systems in the year ended december  which compared to and systems in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the average price of dermatology equipment sold internationally varies due to the quantity mix of refurbished domestic xtrac systems and vtracs sold 
both of these products have lower average selling prices than new xtrac laser systems 
however  by adding these to our product offerings along with expanding into new geographic territories where the products are sold  we have been able to increase overall international dermatology equipment revenues 
we sell refurbished domestic xtrac laser systems into the international market 
the selling price for used equipment is substantially less than new equipment  some of which may be substantially depreciated in connection with its use in the domestic market 
we sold of these used lasers in the year ended december  at an average price of  we sold five and six of these used lasers  at an average price of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and in addition to the xtrac laser system both new and used we sell the vtrac  a lamp based  alternative uvb light source that has a wholesale sales price that is substantially below our competitors international dermatology equipment and below our xtrac laser 
in the years ended december   and  we sold  and vtrac systems  respectively 
the following table illustrates the key changes in the international dermatology equipment segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues less part sales laser lamp revenues laser lamp systems sold average revenue per laser lamp skin care procyte segment for the year ended december   procyte revenues were  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  skin care revenues are generated primarily from the sale of various skin and hair care products  and much less so now from the sale of copper peptide compound and from royalties on licenses 
the product sales decreased slightly for the year ended december  due to the macro economic conditions and to transitioning from the md lash product to our internally developed neova advanced essential lash eyelash conditioner 
this segment is more susceptible to such economic conditions than our other segments because cosmetic products are more likely to be discretionary and not medically necessary 
product sales for the fourth quarter of were approximately million down from approximately million for the fourth quarter of included in product sales for the year ended december  were  of revenues from md lash factor  an eyelash conditioning product  as part of an exclusive license to distribute in the united states 
in there were  of revenues as the product was launched in august we have discontinued marketing md lash factor as of january  under the terms of an agreement with allergan  inc in settlement of certain patent litigation  and are replacing it with our own peptide based conditioner 
bulk compound sales decreased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  minimum contractual royalties from neutrogena expired in november and as such the royalties decreased  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  royalties for the year ended december  decreased  from the year ended december the following table illustrates the key changes in the skin care procyte segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  product sales bulk compound sales royalties total skin care revenue surgical products segment surgical products revenues include revenues derived from the sales of surgical laser systems together with sales of related laser fibers and laser disposables 
sales of laser systems create recurring sales of laser fibers and laser disposables that are more profitable than laser systems 
for the year ended december   surgical products revenues were  compared to  in the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to our oem contract with angiodynamics  which had initial shipments in december in the second half of  however  angiodynamics purchased the assets of diomed  a competitive diode laser company 
if it elects to source its diodes through the business which it has purchased  our future sales of diode lasers to angiodynamics may be severely limited 
sales to angio dynamics were for the last six months of sales to angiodynamics were million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  there were no comparable sales in the year ended december  we therefore do not expect the oem business with angio dynamics will recover in the foreseeable future 
disposables and fiber sales were consistent with the comparable year ended december  we expect that the disposables base may continue to erode over time as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
for the year ended december   surgical products revenues were  compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease was due to  less disposable and fiber sales compared to the prior year period 
also  there was a decline in the average price per laser sold for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
the change in average price per laser between the periods  as set forth in the table below  was largely due to the mix of lasers sold and partly due to the trade level at which the lasers were sold ie wholesale versus retail 
our diode laser has replaced our nd yag laser  which had a substantially higher sales price 
included in laser sales during the years ended december   and were sales of  and diode lasers  respectively 
the diode lasers have lower sales prices than our other types of lasers  and thus the increase in the number of diodes sold reduced the average price per laser 
we expect that we will continue to sell more diode lasers than our other types of lasers into the near future 
the following table illustrates the key changes in the surgical products segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues percent increase decrease laser systems sold laser system revenues average revenue per laser cost of revenues our cost of revenues are comprised of product cost of revenues and service cost of revenues 
within product cost of revenues are the costs of products sold in the international dermatology equipment segment  the skin care segment with royalties included in the services side of the segment  and the surgical products segment with laser maintenance fees included in the services side of this segment 
product costs also include xtrac domestic laser sales 
within services cost of revenues are the costs associated with the domestic xtrac segment  excluding the laser sales  as well as costs associated with the above referenced royalties and maintenance 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  is due to product cost increases from the following business segments domestic xtrac of  international dermatology equipment of  surgical products of  and skin care of  the increases are primarily a result of the increased number of laser sales which have a higher cost percentage than non laser products 
the skin care increase is the result of third party licensed products which have a higher cost 
there were also increases to the excess and obsolete inventory reserves mainly in the surgical product   and skin care segments   warranty expense  which is included in cost of goods sold  amounted to  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  is due to product cost increases from the following business segments domestic xtrac of  international dermatology equipment of  and skincare of  the domestic xtrac and international dermatology equipment increases were primarily a result of increased number of laser sales and the skin care increase was a direct result of the increased sales 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease of  for surgical products 
services cost of revenues was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   representing an increase of  the increase is directly related to the increase in domestic xtrac segment costs of  services cost of revenues was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   representing a decrease of  the decrease is directly related to the decrease in domestic xtrac segment costs of  certain allocable xtrac manufacturing overhead costs are charged against the xtrac service revenues 
the manufacturing facility in carlsbad  california is used exclusively for the production of the xtrac lasers  which are placed in physicians offices domestically or sold 
the unabsorbed costs  relating to excess capacity  are allocated to the domestic xtrac and the international dermatology equipment segments based on actual production of lasers for each segment 
included in these allocated manufacturing costs are unabsorbed labor and direct plant costs 
the following table illustrates the key changes in cost of revenues for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  product xtrac domestic international dermatology equipment skin care surgical products total product costs services xtrac domestic surgical products total services costs total costs of revenues gross profit analysis gross profit increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period in as a percentage of revenues  the gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in gross profit increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period in as a percentage of revenues  the gross margins increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the following table analyzes changes in our gross margin for the periods reflected below company profit analysis for the year ended december  revenues percent increase cost of revenues percent increase gross profit gross margin percentage the primary reasons for changes in gross profit for the year ended december   compared to the same period in were as follows we sold approximately  worth of additional lasers domestically in the year ended december  at lower margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated 
the margin on these capital equipment sales was in the year ended december  compared to in the comparable period in there was an increase in depreciation of  included in the xtrac domestic cost of sales as a result of increasing the overall placements of new lasers since the year ended december  there was an increase in warranty expense of approximately  due to the increased number of laser sales for the year ended december  compared to the same period in additionally  we recorded additional excess and obsolete inventory reserves of approximately  mainly due to the decision to stop production of the cth and co laser systems and for slow moving skincare products 
skincare product revenues included  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  of products which are manufactured by a third party supplier in conjunction with a licensing agreement 
the margin of these licensed products is lower than the margins of other internally developed brands which we distribute 
offsetting the above items that had a negative impact on gross profit  we sold a greater number of treatment procedures for the xtrac laser systems in than in procedure volume increased from  to  billed procedures in the year ended december  compared to the same period in since each incremental treatment procedure carries negligible variable cost  this significantly enhanced profit margins 
the increase in procedure volume was a direct result of improving insurance reimbursement and increased marketing efforts 
we sold approximately  worth of additional international dermatology equipment for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the primary reasons for changes in gross profit for the year ended december   compared to the same period in were as follows we sold a greater number of treatment procedures for the xtrac laser systems in than in procedure volume increased from  to  billed procedures in the year ended december  compared to the same period in since each incremental treatment procedure carries negligible variable cost  this significantly enhanced profit margins 
the increase in procedure volume was a direct result of improving insurance reimbursement and increased marketing efforts 
we sold approximately  worth of additional international dermatology equipment for the year ended december  compared to the same period in we sold approximately  worth of additional lasers domestically in the year ended december  at lower margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated 
there was an increase in warranty expense of approximately  due to the increased number of laser sales for the year ended december  compared to the same period in there was an increase in depreciation of  included in the xtrac domestic cost of sales as a result of increasing the overall placements of new lasers since the year ended december  the following table analyzes the gross profit for our domestic xtrac segment for the periods reflected below xtrac domestic segment for the year ended december  revenues percent increase cost of revenues percent increase gross profit gross margin percentage gross profit increased for this segment for the year ended december  from the comparable periods in by  the key factors were as follows xtrac domestic deferred revenues increased  between the year end periods without any offset in the cost of revenues 
the cost of revenues increased by  for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in depreciation on the lasers in service of  an increase in cost of revenues related to the laser sales of  and an increase in warranty expense of  over the comparable prior period 
the depreciation costs will continue to increase in subsequent periods as the business grows 
in addition  there were unabsorbed costs  relating to excess capacity  allocated to the domestic xtrac including unabsorbed labor and direct plant costs 
we sold approximately  worth of additional domestic xtrac lasers in the year ended december  at lower margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated  since they were placements 
the margin on these capital equipment sales was in the year ended december  compared to in the comparable period in key drivers in increasing the fee per procedure revenue from this segment are insurance reimbursement and increased direct to consumer advertising in targeted territories 
improved insurance reimbursement  together with greater consumer awareness of the xtrac therapy  increase treatment revenue accordingly 
our clinical support specialists focus their efforts on increasing physicians utilization of the xtrac laser system 
consequently procedure volume increased from  to  billed procedures in the year ended december  compared to the same period in price per procedure did not change significantly between the periods 
each incremental treatment procedure carries negligible variable cost 
gross profit increased for this segment for the year ended december  from the comparable period in by  the key factors were as follows xtrac domestic deferred revenues increased  between the year end periods without any offset in the cost of revenues which is consistent with a procedures based model 
we sold approximately  worth of additional domestic xtrac lasers in the year ended december  at lower margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated  since they were originally placements 
the margin on these capital equipment sales was in the year ended december  compared to in the comparable period in the cost of revenues increased by  for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in depreciation on the lasers in service of  an increase in cost of revenues related to the laser sales of  and an increase in warranty expense of  over the comparable prior period 
the depreciation costs will continue to increase in subsequent periods as the business grows

in february  however  we received an additional million of working capital under the convertible note from the investor  approximately million of which will be used for obligations incurred in connection with the ptl acquisition 
we believe that our existing cash balance together including the working capital received in the financing of the ptl acquisition  together with our other existing potential financial resources and any revenues from sales and distribution  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements beyond the second quarter of the operating plan reflects increases in per treatment fee revenues for use of the xtrac system based on increased utilization of the xtrac by physicians and on wider insurance coverage in the united states

each draw against the credit facility has a repayment period of three years  except for legacy components from ge and leaf in the first draw 
on september   the facility was amended to permit us to make a fourth draw of million in the third quarter of  life sciences capital did not participate in the fourth draw 
we have used our entire availability under the cit credit facility and are considering  with cit s support  multiple written proposals  including from cit  for additional debt financing 
however  no assurance can be given that any such proposal will materialize on terms favorable to us  if at all 
on february   the investor  llc funded million of working capital as part of the first tranche of the convertible debt in connection with our acquisition of photo therapeutics
