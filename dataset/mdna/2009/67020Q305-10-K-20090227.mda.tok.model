you should read the following discussion of our financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included herein item 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of these risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please see risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of wireless and wireline communications services to consumers and businesses primarily in virginia and west virginia under the ntelos brand name 
our wireless operations are composed of an ntelos branded retail business and a wholesale business that we operate under an exclusive contract with sprint spectrum l 
p  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sprint nextel corporation hereinafter collectively referred to as sprint nextel 
we believe our regional focus and contiguous service area provide us with a differentiated competitive position relative to our primary wireless competitors  all of whom are national providers 
our wireless revenues have experienced a compound annual growth rate from to and accounted for of our total revenues in we hold digital pcs licenses to operate in basic trading areas with a licensed population of approximately million  and we have deployed a network using code division multiple access technology  or cdma  in basic trading areas which currently cover a total population of approximately million potential subscribers 
as of december   our wireless retail business had approximately  ntelos branded subscribers  representing a penetration of our total covered population 
we have made significant investments in our wireless network since  adding new wireless cell sites and increasing our total cell sites to  by the end of these investments and other initiatives contributed to a increase in subscribers in we amended our agreement with sprint spectrum lp during to act as their exclusive wholesale provider of network services through july  under this arrangement  which we refer to as the strategic network alliance  we are the exclusive pcs service provider in our western virginia and west virginia service area for all sprint nextel cdma wireless customers see business wireless business our strategic network alliance with sprint nextel 
under the terms of the agreement  we are committed to upgrading our wireless network to evolution data optimized revision a ev do in the territory covered by the agreement 
we expect our aggregate incremental capital expenditures for this upgrade to ev do in all of our markets to be approximately million  of which million was spent in  million was spent in and the remainder of approximately million is expected to be spent in we met the build out completion target defined in the strategic network alliance during the fourth quarter  after which the monthly revenue minimum was increased from million to million 
as of december   or of our total cell sites have been upgraded to ev do 
for the year ended december   we realized wholesale revenues of million  primarily related to the strategic network alliance  representing an increase of over in addition  this upgrade has helped increase retail data arpu by  offsetting the downward pressure on voice arpu 
founded in  our wireline incumbent local exchange carrier business is conducted through two subsidiaries that qualify as rural local exchange carriers rlecs under the telecommunications act 
these two rlecs provide wireline communications services to residential and business customers in the western virginia communities of waynesboro  covington  clifton forge and portions of botetourt and augusta counties 
as of december   we operated approximately  rlec telephone access lines 
we also own a  route mile regional fiber optic network and participate in partnerships that directly connect our networks with many of the largest markets in the mid atlantic region 
we leverage our wireline network infrastructure to offer competitive voice and data communication services in virginia and west virginia outside our rlec coverage area 
within our competitive segment  we market and sell local and long distance  voice and data services almost exclusively to business customers through our competitive local exchange carrier  or clec  and internet service provider  or isp  operation 
as of december   we served customers with approximately  clec access line connections 
we also offer dsl services in over of our rlec service area and as of december  we operated approximately  broadband access connections in our markets  representing an increase of in the wireline competitive segment strategic products local phone services  broadband voice and data services and high capacity network access and transport services experienced revenue growth of over in and  our wireline operating income margins were and  respectively 
commencing in late  we have been introducing ntelos video in selected neighborhoods within our two rlec service areas 

table of contents the product provides an alternative to cable and satellite tv  offering video entertainment services with more than all digital channels and high definition channels 
it is delivered via fiber to the home which allows us to deliver video  local and long distance telephone services  plus internet access at speeds up to megabits per second 
at december   we had approximately  video customers and passed  homes with fiber 
revenues from the broadband and video products are included in the competitive wireline segment 
we were formed in january by citigroup venture capital equity partners  lp  and certain of its affiliates  collectively cvc  and quadrangle capital partners llp and certain of its affiliates  collectively quadrangle  for the purpose of acquiring ntelos inc on january   we entered into an agreement with ntelos inc and certain of its shareholders to acquire the common stock of ntelos inc  making an initial investment on february  on may   we acquired all of ntelos inc s remaining common shares  warrants and vested options by means of a merger at which time ntelos inc became a wholly owned subsidiary 
during the first quarter of  holdings corp 
completed an initial public offering the ipo of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million which we used to make a termination payment of the advisory agreements with cvc and quadrangle  redeem our floating rate senior notes in full  and the balance  combined with available cash  was used to pay a dividend on the company s class b common 
all class b common stock was subsequently converted to common stock during on april   in a secondary offering of our common stock  cvc and quadrangle and certain of their affiliates sold an aggregate of  shares priced at per share 
this resulted in their combined ownership declining from to approximately 
we did not receive any proceeds from the offering and our total shares outstanding did not change as a result of this offering 
direct costs of this offering  primarily legal  printing and accounting fees  totaled million 
on september   quadrangle agreed to acquire all of the shares of ntelos common stock owned by cvc and certain affiliated limited partnerships 
with this acquisition  private equity funds affiliated with quadrangle own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we began paying cash dividends on our common stock during the board of directors declared cash dividends in the amount of per share during  which amounted to million 
the board of directors declared cash dividends in the amount of per share during  which amounted to million 
we expect many of the factors which affected our results of operations in to continue into additionally  the impact of overall economic conditions that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of is expected to continue into in wireless  the current economic climate contributed to slower wireless subscriber growth and an increase in customer churn in and these trends are expected to continue in additionally  postpay competition is expected to stiffen as the market gets closer to saturation 
competition with prepaid products also will likely intensify as more competitors target this segment as a means to sustain growth and increase market share 
average monthly revenues per handset unit in service  or arpu  from voice is expected to continue to decline due to competitive and economic conditions 
however  we anticipate data arpu will continue to grow and more than offset the decline in voice arpu 
higher handset subsidy costs are expected in as compared to due to an expected higher mix of smart phones and air cards associated with the projected growth in data arpu 
data arpu and revenue are expected to grow due to the continued increase in penetration and usage escalating from our ev do deployment  however  this also will result in a significant increase in network expenses and data cost of sales  both of which are captured in cost of sales and services 
the network expenses will increase in due to having a full year of expenses related to ev do markets deployed during and to new ev do deployment in capital expenditures associated with the ev do upgrade are expected to decrease as a large portion of that upgrade was completed in wireless wholesale revenue is expected to continue to grow for the first half of driven by growth in revenue from the strategic network alliance with sprint 
however  effective july   one of the key rate elements will be reset and is expected to be reduced  the impact of which will likely result in total revenue from the sprint agreement being billed at the million monthly minimum for the balance of wireline revenue within the competitive segment is expected to continue to grow from our strategic products although the economy may have an adverse impact in additionally  access line losses are expected to continue  impacted by continued cable competition and wireless substitution 

table of contents the swap agreement fair value was a million liability at december  this liability will likely be reduced by december  as it approaches expiration in february other overview discussion to supplement our financial statements presented under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  throughout this document we reference non gaap measures  such as arpu to measure operating performance for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance 
arpu is a telecommunications industry metric that measures service revenues per period divided by the weighted average number of handsets in service during that period 
arpu as defined below may not be similar to arpu measures of other companies  is not a measurement under gaap and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closely monitor the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on arpu in order to determine their effectiveness 
we believe arpu provides management useful information concerning the appeal of our rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers 
the table below provides a reconciliation of operating revenue from our wireless segment note in our notes to consolidated financial statements to subscriber revenues used to calculate average monthly arpu for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands  other than average monthly arpu data wireless communications revenues less equipment revenues from sales to new customers less equipment revenues from sales to existing customers less wholesale revenues less plus other revenues and adjustments wireless gross subscriber revenues average number of subscribers total arpu wireless gross subscriber revenues less wireless voice and other features revenues wireless data revenues average number of subscribers total data arpu we entered into a new agreement with more favorable terms to provide handset insurance to wireless subscribers  effective april  due to the differences in the terms of this new arrangement  revenues for handset insurance are no longer reported on a gross basis  but on a net basis instead 
this has led to a reduction in total arpu from the comparative twelve month periods in and historical periods will not be restated 
the following table presents pro forma total arpu had this arrangement been in effect for all periods presented total arpu as reported total arpu pro forma reduction 
table of contents in september of  we launched a new prepay billing platform which enhanced product offerings to customers and allowed us to separately identify certain data revenues previously bundled into blended arpu  and certain of the underlying plans were modified to offer data services 
accordingly  beginning in the fourth quarter of  this revenue is included in data revenue 
additionally  beginning in the first quarter of  an allocation of certain postpay bundled package revenues representing the portion relating to data was reclassified into data revenue 
these items contributed to accelerated growth in data arpu over and operating revenues our revenues are generated from the following categories wireless pcs  consisting of retail revenues from network access  data services  equipment revenues and feature services  and wholesale revenues from the strategic network alliance and roaming from other carriers  rlec segment revenues  including local service  network access  toll and directory advertising  competitive segment revenues  including revenues from our key strategic products local services  iptv based video services  broadband voice and data services  and high capacity network access and transport services  long distance and dial up internet services  and other communications services revenues  including primarily revenues from paging and revenue from leasing excess building space 
operating expenses our operating expenses are incurred from the following categories cost of sales and services  including digital pcs handset equipment costs which  in keeping with industry practice  we generally sell to our customers at a price below our cost  and usage based access charges  including long distance  roaming charges  and other direct costs incurred in accessing other telecommunications providers networks in order to provide telecommunication services to our end use customers  leased facility expenses for connection to other carriers  cell sites and switch locations and engineering and other expenses for service related property  plant and equipment  customer operations expenses  including marketing  product management  product advertising  selling  billing  publication of regional telephone directories  customer care  directory services and bad debt expenses  corporate operations expenses  including taxes other than income  executive  accounting  legal  purchasing  information technology  human resources and other general and administrative expenses  including earned bonuses above target achievement levels  non cash compensation expense related to stock and option instruments held by certain members of corporate management  expenses related to the voluntary early retirement plan verp and secondary offering costs  depreciation and amortization  including depreciable long lived property  plant and equipment  amortization of intangible assets where applicable and impairment charge on licenses not in service  accretion of asset retirement obligations  or aro  and  termination of advisory agreements 
other income expenses our other income expenses are generated incurred from interest expense on debt instruments  including changes in fair value of our interest rate swap instrument  other income  which includes interest income  and gain on sale of investments 

table of contents income taxes our income tax expense and effective tax rate increases or decreases based upon changes in a number of factors  including our pre tax income or loss  state minimum tax assessments  and non deductible expenses 
minority interests in losses earnings of subsidiaries our minority interest relates to a rlec segment investment in a partnership that owns certain signaling equipment and provides service to a number of small rlecs and to verisign 
we also have a majority interest in the virginia pcs alliance lc  or the va alliance  that provides pcs services to a million populated area in central and western virginia 
the va alliance has incurred cumulative operating losses since it initiated pcs services in given that the total of minority member contributions and cumulative operating results are negative during all periods reported  we recognize a credit to minority interest only to the extent of capital contributions from the minority owners 
no such contributions were made during the years ended december   or results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  wireless pcs accounted for of the increase  with growth occurring from subscriber revenues  wholesale revenues and equipment sales 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from growth in key strategic product revenues in the competitive segment  partially offset by declines in other revenues from the competitive segment and rlec revenues 
operating income increased million over the comparative year  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  operating margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  net income increased million over the comparative year 
in addition to the million increase in operating income  interest expense decreased million 
these changes  which served to increase net income  were partially offset by an increase in the loss on the fair value of swap instruments of million and an increase in income tax expense of million 
operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues on a business segment basis for the years ended december  and year ended december  variance variance operating revenues dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from to due to an increase in our ntelos branded net subscriber revenue of million  or  a million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues and an increase in equipment sales revenues of million  or 

table of contents the increase in subscriber revenue reflect increased postpay revenue of million  or  million of which is from growth in data revenues 
underlying this growth in data revenue was the technology upgrade to ev do deployed to of our cell sites by year end  and an increased sales emphasis on smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with a richer array of data packages 
the total data arpu for all prepay and postpay products was for compared to for  an increase of 
in addition to this apru growth  the take rates on data packages and usage rates continues to rapidly expand 
growth in data arpu has offset declines in voice rates resulting from economic and competitive pressure  leading to blended arpu of for  below blended arpu of for however  pro forma of the handset insurance reporting change see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above  blended arpu increased year over year  from in to in in addition to the data arpu growth  total subscribers increased from  at december  to  at december   a  or  net subscriber growth 
the year over year increase in wholesale and roaming revenues was driven by a million  or  increase in revenue from the strategic network alliance 
additionally  roaming revenues from other carriers grew million 
our wholesale revenues derived from the strategic network alliance are primarily from the voice usage by sprint nextel customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area home minutes of use  those customers of sprint nextel who use our network for voice services while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area travel minutes of use and data usage by sprint nextel customers who live in or travel through the strategic network alliance service area 
in addition to volume increases experienced on existing cell sites  we added cell sites within this wholesale service area in  improving existing service and extending this coverage area 
on july   we entered into an amended and restated resale agreement agreement with sprint spectrum l 
p  which became effective as of july  the agreement superseded and replaced the original resale agreement and extended the term of the original resale agreement  committed us to perform network upgrades and changed pricing structures  including the addition of revenue minimum guarantees 
we met the build out completion target defined in the agreement during the fourth quarter  after which the monthly revenue minimum was increased from million to million 
the term extension noted above was four years over the resale agreement term  to july   subject to automatic three year extensions unless certain notice provisions are exercised 
the agreement prohibits sprint nextel from directly or indirectly commencing construction of  contracting for or launching its own wireless communications network in the agreement territory until months prior to end of the agreement 
the agreement specifies a series of usage rates for various types of services 
the voice rate pricing under the agreement was fixed through july   at rates comparable to the rates in the resale agreement  but provides for greater volume discounts in the future to provide incentives for the migration of additional traffic onto the network 
after july   the voice rates will be reset semi annually based on sprint nextel s voice revenue yield 
generally  the data rate pricing is lower under the agreement compared to the rates agreed to in the resale agreement in recognition of the significant growth experience in data usage and anticipated growth from the introduction of higher speed data services as a result of the network upgrade and to also provide incentives for the migration of additional traffic onto the network 
data rates for sprint nextel in market home subscribers are on a per subscriber basis 
the data rate for sprint nextel customers that are traveling through the territory covered by the agreement and use the network are on a per kilobyte basis  reset quarterly beginning july  the strategic network alliance also permits our ntelos branded customers to access sprint nextel s national wireless network at reciprocal rates as the sprint nextel travel rates 
we estimate that the july  travel data rate reset will significantly decrease the rate currently in effect and will result in total revenue from this agreement to be billed at the million monthly minimum for the balance of wireline communications revenues wireline communications revenues increased million  or  with revenues from strategic products increasing million  or  and revenues from rlec and other revenues from the competitive segment decreasing million and million  respectively 
rlec revenues 
rlec revenues  which include local service  network access  toll service  directory advertising and calling feature revenues from our rlec customers  decreased primarily due to the decrease in local service revenues and access revenues as a result of a decrease in access lines  which is discussed in further detail below 
access lines totaled approximately  as of december  and  as of december  in addition to the impact from access line loss  the interstate access rate per minute declined more than primarily attributable to a biennial reset of rlec interstate access rates on july   impacting both end user access and tandem switching access 
also  national exchange carrier 
table of contents association neca settlement rates declined  primarily related to the access line loss 
partially offsetting these factors was a increase in carrier access minutes due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers 
our interstate access rates will be subject to a biennial reset reduction on july  the access line loss noted above is reflective of residential wireless substitution  second line losses and the introduction of competitive voice service offerings from comcast  which commenced in may in one of our three rlec markets 
we expect that this competition will primarily be for residential customers 
we expect to encounter additional voice competition from comcast and rapid communications  now owned by shenandoah telecommunications company  in we project our access line loss percent in will be similar to that of competitive wireline revenues 
competitive wireline revenue for increased million over  with the growth in strategic products being offset by the decline in other revenues as noted above 
strategic product revenues are comprised of local services  iptv based video services  broadband voice and data services  and high capacity network access and transport services 
broadband voice and data services include broadband over fiber  dedicated internet access  dsl  integrated access and metro ethernet 
revenues from these services increased million  or 
additionally  revenues from private line  carrier access and transport services increased million  or 
dial up internet customers continue to decline  resulting in a revenue decline of million  to million for  and switched access  reciprocal compensation and other miscellaneous revenue declined million  to million for on september   the virginia state corporation commission issued a final order in a rulemaking docket that capped clecs intrastate switched access charges  including the access charges of our clecs  at the higher of the clec s interstate switched access charges or the intrastate switched access charges of the ilec or the average of all ilecs providing service in the geographic area served by the clec 
the cap took effect at the end of a transition period that began on december  and ended on march  as part of that transition  we reduced our clec access rates effective on december  and again on april  these lower rates reduced our clec access revenues by a total of million in 
table of contents operating expenses the following table identifies our operating expenses on a business segment basis  consistent with the table presenting operating revenues above  for the years ended december  and year ended december  variance variance operating expenses dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other operating expenses  before non cash compensation charges  voluntary early retirement plan charges  secondary offering costs  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations non cash compensation voluntary early retirement charges n m secondary offering costs depreciation and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations total operating expenses operating expenses the following describes our operating expenses by segment and on a basis consistent with our financial statement presentation 
the discussion below relates to our operating expenses by segment before non cash compensation charges  voluntary early retirement plan charges  secondary offering costs  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations wireless communications of the increase in wireless communications operating expenses noted in the table above  variable cost of sales and services cos accounted for million due primarily to the increase in sales to existing subscribers that upgrade and extend their contract period 
this was more prolific in due to the increase in selection of smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with more data product offerings and capabilities 
also  we entered into a new handset insurance contract whereby we sold million of equipment to the insurance provider 
increases in roaming and data cos were partially offset by a reduction in handset insurance cos related to the april  reporting change discussed in the other overview discussion section above 
we expect continued growth in cos expenses as our customer base grows  sales of national plans increase  sales of smart phones continue to represent a significantly higher percentage of total sales than in the prior year and usage of data features increases 
the remaining operating expense increase in wireless communications over the comparative period was due to increased costs of maintaining our network  combined with direct and indirect costs of sales and services expenses 
specifically  cell site and network access expenses increased million year over year related to additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network and to support our increased subscriber base  and a increase in the number of cell sites as of december  over december  finally  customer retention and advertising expense increased million year over year and operating taxes and regulatory fees increased a total of million see further discussion below under corporate operations expenses 

table of contents wireline communications the decrease in wireline operating expenses noted in the table above is partially attributable to a million decrease in bad debt expense from primarily due to improved accounts receivable turnover and aging 
also  compensation expenses decreased million  most of which is attributable to savings realized during the second half of related to the voluntary early retirement plan described below  and a million decrease in allocated corporate expenses as a result of an increased percentage of corporate expenses attributable to the significantly faster growing wireless segment 
finally  network access and other network related expenses were flat year over year due to ongoing network grooming and shifting of traffic to our network versus leased network facilities 
other the increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to unallocated accounting and other professional services performed in early associated with the year end professional expenses related to our first year of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and executive recruiting expenses 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services increased million  or  from to as discussed above  wireless variable cost of sales and services increased million year over year and cell site and network access expenses increased million related to cell site expansion and the capacity increase related to the network upgrade to ev do 
the portion of this increase related to the ev do upgrade million results in our adding additional access expenses for every cell site upgraded 
equipment cost of sales increased million in over due to the increase in subscriber additions  the increase in exchanges and sales to existing customers  and the increase in handset sales to our handset insurance provider 
roaming cos increased million year over year primarily to an increased mix of national plans and other plans which contain more roaming minutes  partially offset by in network roaming savings related to continued cell site expansion 
the percentage of subscribers with a national plan increased from as of december  to as of december  data cos increased million in over consistent with increased data usage and revenues 
these and other increases in wireless cost of sales and services were offset by an million decrease in handset insurance cost of sales from primarily related to a change in the reporting of handset insurance from a gross to a net basis effective april  see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above 
as noted above  wireline network access and other network related expenses were flat due to improved utilization  efficiency and on network traffic 
this is a result of grooming provision configuration enhanced by our commitment over the last three years to invest in our network to move traffic from leased to owned facilities and in improve margins and control service quality 
customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from to wireless retention and advertising expenses increased million related to an increase in promotional pricing needed to combat the increase in competitive and economic pressures experienced in compensation and benefits expenses increased million associated with inflationary growth in wages and an increase in personnel to support subscriber growth 
the remaining increases in over primarily relate to contracted services  rent expense  postage and our phonebook directory 
offsetting these increases were decreases in bad debt expense of million due to improvement in accounts receivable aging and collections forecasts at december  versus the prior year end 
also  wireless selling expenses decreased million due to the decrease in sales through the higher cost third party agent channel 
corporate operations expenses corporate operations expenses increased million  or  from to the results for contain million of charges related to a voluntary early retirement plan offered to a select number of wireline employees 
these charges primarily represent an enhanced pension benefit offered to the employees who accepted the early retirement offer 
regulatory fees increased million and operating taxes increased million 
in  we resolved a tax dispute which resulted in a million operating tax recovery related to a favorable ruling from tax authorities 
additionally  in we resolved other operating tax matters which favorably impacted operating tax expense 
finally  operating taxes increased related to the increase in assets and revenues and other items which are the basis from which these taxes are calculated 
offsetting 
table of contents these increases was a decrease of million relating to legal  accounting and other expenses associated with the secondary stock offering completed in the first quarter of  a million decrease in compensation expense due to a decrease in performance based compensation expense and a million decrease in non cash compensation 
non cash compensation expense decreased as a result of the final vesting of the majority of our former class a shares in the second quarter of note 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  from to this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in accelerated depreciation of million related to g xrtt and other equipment scheduled to be replaced earlier than originally anticipated related to the ev do upgrade discussed below and a million impairment charge recorded in related to certain c block pcs spectrum 
the spectrum impairment charge reflects the reduction in value of the remaining c block pcs spectrum not in service in two markets to their current estimated net realizable value 
in addition to this  normal depreciation increased million due to the million increase in the average depreciable base  with significant investments in property  plant and equipment during and  as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resource section below 
partially offsetting this was a million year over year decrease in amortization expense related to the change in the remaining useful life of the intangible asset associated with the strategic network alliance with sprint nextel due to the extension of the contract period end to july as discussed above in the wireless communications revenue section  we have upgraded a majority of our coverage areas with ev do 
during and  we have recorded million and million  respectively  in accelerated depreciation primarily on the g xrtt assets as they have been disposed of or are planned for disposal prior to their previously planned useful lives 
we expect to record approximately million of additional accelerated depreciation in accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion of asset retirement obligations is recorded in order to accrete the estimated asset retirement obligation over the life of the related asset up to its future expected settlement cost 
this charge increased million in over primarily due to cell site expansion 
other income expenses interest expense on debt instruments decreased million  or  from to due primarily to the precipitous drop in libor rates and a lower debt balance due to million of debt repayment during and million of scheduled debt repayments in loss on interest rate swap instrument s increased million from to in february  ntelos inc entered into a new  month interest rate swap agreement which commenced in september to replace the previous interest rate swap 
these swap agreements were not designated as interest rate hedge instruments for accounting purposes and  therefore  the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements were recorded as gain loss on interest rate swap 
the million loss on interest rate swap recorded in related primarily to the sharp downturn during the fourth quarter in projected libor rates over the remaining life of the swap agreement 
the million loss recorded in was a result of the underlying instruments having a fair value of a million asset at the end of compared to a fair value of a million asset at december  included in the securities and investments section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the current swap agreement had a fair value of a million liability which is included in the long term liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents other income primarily relates to interest income from cash and cash equivalents 
it declined million from to due to significantly lower short term investment interest rates partially offset by a higher average cash and cash equivalent balance in the current versus the prior year 
income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  representing the statutory tax rate applied to pre tax income and the effects of non deductible  non cash stock based compensation 
we expect our recurring non deductible expenses to relate primarily to certain non cash stock based compensation 
the annual amounts of these charges based on equity based awards outstanding as of december  are projected to be approximately million in income tax expense for the year ended december  was million 
the primary permanent differences relate to the effects of non deductible  non cash stock based compensation  state minimum taxes  and non deductible secondary offering transaction costs 
we have unused net operating losses nols totaling million as of december  these nols  along with net unrealized losses existing at the september bankruptcy emergence date  are subject to an annual utilization limitation of million prior to adjustment for realization of built in gains that existed as of the merger  with a maximum limitation of million 
based on this limitation and the adjustments required for certain built in gains realized or to be realized during the five year period immediately following our may  merger  we expect to use nols of approximately million as follows million per year in through  million in and million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview operating revenues increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  wireless pcs accounted for of the increase  with growth occurring from subscriber revenues  wholesale revenues and equipment sales 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from minute driven increases in rlec access revenues and increases in key strategic products in the competitive segment  partially offset by declines in other revenues from the competitive segment dial up internet services  switched access and reciprocal compensation 
operating income increased million over the comparative years  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  operating margin  before non cash compensation  advisory fees and termination of advisory agreements  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  net income increased million from a net loss of million for the year ended december  to net income of million for the year ended december  included in net loss for the year ended december  was a charge of million for the termination of advisory agreements and interest expense that was million higher during than  which related to interest on the floating rate notes retired in april  million of non recurring interest expense charges related to the early retirement of debt and lower interest during as a result of the refinancing transaction in june non cash compensation charges were million higher during than driven by expense recognition commensurate with the ipo 
in addition  there was a million year over year increase in income tax expense  which was primarily driven by the significant change in taxable income 

table of contents operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues on a business segment basis for the years ended december  and year ended december  variance variance operating revenues dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in our ntelos branded net subscriber revenue of million  or  an million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues  and a million  or  increase in equipment sales revenues related to a increase in gross subscriber additions 
subscriber revenues reflected subscriber growth of  or approximately  subscribers  from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately  subscribers as of december  for the comparative years  subscriber revenues reflected the subscriber growth described above and also reflect an increase in arpu of  from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in arpu is primarily attributable to the continued growth in data services  data packages and higher priced product offerings 
total data arpu was for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december  see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above 
gross subscriber additions were higher for  at approximately  compared to gross subscriber additions of approximately  for this increase in gross additions combined with the introduction of more feature rich handsets sold in the period as compared to the period led to an increase in equipment sales revenue of million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  also contributing to the revenue increase was a basis point decrease in total subscriber churn  from for the year ended december  approximately  subscribers to for the year ended december  approximately  subscribers  due to network and service quality improvements and the continued increase in the number of national and unlimited postpay subscriber plans and other program improvements in the increase in wholesale revenues for the twelve month comparative periods was driven by increased voice and data usage under the strategic network alliance 
wholesale revenues grew for the year  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in addition to volume increases experienced on existing cell sites  we have added cell sites within this wholesale service area over the last two years  improving existing service and extending this coverage area 
wholesale pricing reductions under the strategic network alliance went into effect on july  relating to travel minutes of use and data usage in accordance with the annual pricing reset provisions of this wholesale agreement 
the impact of the july pricing reductions was more than offset by increased usage 
on july   we entered into an amended and restated resale agreement agreement with sprint spectrum l 
p  which became effective as of july  the agreement supersedes and replaces the original resale agreement and extends the term of the original resale agreement  commits us to perform network upgrades and changes pricing structures  including the addition of revenue minimum guarantees as discussed in the revenue discussions above 

table of contents wireline communications revenues wireline communications revenues increased million over the comparative years 
rlec revenues 
rlec revenues  which include local service  network access  toll service  directory advertising and calling feature revenues from our rlec customers  increased million over the comparative years despite a access line decrease  with lines totaling approximately  as of december  compared to approximately  as of december  the revenue increase was due primarily to increased access revenues of million  or over the comparative years driven by an increase in carrier access minutes of from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers 
this increase was offset by a million lump sum cash receipt in september from the universal service administrative company usac pursuant to an fcc order related to our safety net support dispute for the period january through september ntelos telephone company s interstate access rates were subject to a biennial reset on july  the rate reset resulted in a million reduction of this revenue for the year 
the access line loss noted above is reflective primarily of residential wireless substitution  second line losses and pbx displacement of centrex lines 
these line losses do not reflect the introduction of competitive voice service offerings  such as from cable companies or clecs  in our markets 
competitive wireline revenues 
competitive wireline revenue increased million in driven by revenues from our key strategic products local services  broadband voice and data services  and high capacity network access and transport services in the competitive wireline segment which grew million  or  over the comparative years  offset by declines in other competitive revenues dial up internet services  switched access and reciprocal compensation 
revenues from broadband  integrated access and metro ethernet services increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due primarily to customer growth of with the broadband products  particularly in the products with higher bandwidth

critical accounting policies and estimates the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies for discussion herein 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 

table of contents principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  ntelos inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and those limited liability corporations where ntelos inc  as managing member  exercises control 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
revenue recognition policies the company recognizes revenue when services are rendered or when products are delivered  installed and functional  as applicable 
certain services of the company require payment in advance of service performance 
in such cases  the company records a service liability at the time of billing and subsequently recognizes revenue over the service period 
the company is required to bill customers certain transactional taxes on service revenues 
these transactional taxes are not included in reported revenues as they are recognized as liabilities at the time customers are billed 
the company earns revenue by providing access to and usage of its networks in both its wireline and wireless divisions 
local service and airtime revenues are recognized as services are provided 
wholesale revenues are earned by providing switched access and other switched and dedicated services  including wireless roamer management  to other carriers 
revenues for equipment sales are recognized at the point of sale 
pcs handset equipment sold with service contracts are generally sold at prices below cost  based on the terms of the service contracts 
the company recognizes the entire cost of the handsets at the time of sale 
the company evaluates related transactions to determine whether they should be viewed as multiple deliverable arrangements  which impact revenue recognition 
multiple deliverable arrangements are presumed to be bundled transactions and the total consideration is measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair value with certain limitations 
the company has determined that sales of handsets with service contracts related to these sales generated from company owned retail stores are multiple deliverable arrangements 
accordingly  substantially all of the nonrefundable activation fee revenues as well as the associated direct costs are recognized at the time the related wireless handset is sold based on the fact that the handsets are generally sold below cost and on the relative fair value evaluation 
however  revenue and certain associated direct costs for activations sold at third party retail locations are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship as the company is not a principal in the transaction to sell the handset 
nonrefundable activation fee revenue and certain associated direct costs for transactions in segments other than wireless are deferred as they are not associated with multiple deliverable arrangements but are directly associated with the underlying service being provided over the applicable coverage period 
in all cases  the direct activation costs exceed the related activation revenues 
when deferral is appropriate  the company defers these direct activation costs up to but not in excess of the related deferred revenue 
the company periodically makes claims for recovery of access charges on certain minutes of use terminated by the company on behalf of other carriers 
the company recognizes revenue in the period that it is able to estimate the amount and when the collection of such amount is considered probable 
accounts receivable the company sells its services to residential and commercial end users and to other communication carriers primarily in virginia and west virginia 
the company has credit and collection policies to ensure collection of trade receivables and requires deposits on certain sales 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical results  current and expected trends and changes in credit policies 
management believes the allowance adequately covers all anticipated losses with respect to trade receivables 
actual credit losses could differ from such estimates 
inventories and supplies the company s inventories and supplies consist primarily of items held for resale such as pcs handsets and accessories  and wireline business phones and accessories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
market value is determined by reviewing current replacement cost  marketability and obsolescence 

table of contents long lived asset recovery long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  radio spectrum licenses  long term deferred charges and intangible assets to be held and used 
long lived assets  excluding intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value 
in  the company tested for impairment of its wireless segment assets in accordance with sfas no 
based on the planned evolution data optimized revision a ev do upgrade 
no impairment existed then and the company believes that no other impairment indicators existed between then and december  that would require it to perform further impairment testing 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which the company reviews and updates based on historical experiences and future expectations 
buildings are depreciated over a year life and leasehold improvements  which are categorized with land and buildings  are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease terms 
network plant and equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years  with a weighted average life of approximately years 
furniture  fixtures and other equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill  franchise rights and radio spectrum licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
the company assesses the recoverability of indefinite lived assets annually on october and whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the company has pcs radio spectrum licenses with a book value of million in two markets where it is not currently providing service and which have build out requirements in june the company has executed a long term lease agreement and a license purchase agreement that establish the framework for assistance with meeting the build out requirements in exchange for transferring a portion of each license 
therefore  the company has recorded a million impairment million after income tax on these licenses  reflecting the reduction in value of the remaining pcs spectrum licenses not in service in these markets to their current estimated net realizable value 
this impairment has been classified within depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  based on the company s evaluation of fair value of its other licenses not in service  as well as its licenses in service  all of which represent the company s indefinite lived intangible assets  no impairment existed as of october  additionally  the company tested goodwill for impairment at october  and determined that it was not impaired
