item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview throughout fiscal  fiscal and most of fiscal  the homebuilding environment continued to deteriorate against a backdrop of macroeconomic recession  declining consumer confidence and significant tightening in the availability of home mortgage credit 
while we have begun to see signs that some negative market trends may be moderating at both local and national levels  key macroeconomic indicators remain soft or mixed 
in addition  throughout fiscal  the credit markets and the mortgage industry have experienced a period of disruption characterized by bankruptcy  financial institution failure  consolidation and an unprecedented level of intervention by the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  it has made it more difficult for homebuyers to obtain acceptable financing 
although the supply of new and resale homes in the marketplace has decreased recently  it is still excessive for the current level of consumer demand and is 
table of contents challenged by an increased number of foreclosed homes offered at substantially reduced prices 
these pressures in the marketplace have resulted in the use of increased sales incentives and price reductions in an effort to generate sales and reduce inventory levels by us and many of our competitors throughout much of our fiscal we have responded to this challenging environment with a disciplined approach to the business with continued reductions in direct costs  overhead expenses and land spending 
we have limited our supply of unsold homes under construction and have focused on the generation of cash from our existing inventory supply as we strive to align our land supply and inventory levels to current expectations for home closings 
during fiscal  as the macro economic environment tempered  we continued to focus on the preservation of cash on hand and cash generation from the sale of existing inventory supply  including the introduction of additional sales incentives and reduced sales prices in certain situations in order to move this inventory 
we also reevaluated pricing and incentives offered in select communities in response to local market conditions to generate sales on to be built inventory 
certain of these changes resulted in adjustments to our inventory valuations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company s fiscal inventory impairments 
in addition  we undertook the initial steps in improving our capitalization with the repurchase of million of our senior notes at a discount and the issuance of million of senior secured notes due see note to the consolidated financial statements where further discussed 
in fiscal  we completed a comprehensive review of each of our markets in order to refine our overall investment strategy and to optimize capital and resource allocations in an effort to enhance our financial position and to increase shareholder value 
this review entailed an evaluation of both external market factors and our position in each market and resulted in the decision formalized and announced on february   to discontinue homebuilding operations in charlotte  nc  cincinnati dayton  oh  columbia  sc  columbus  oh and lexington  ky 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced our decision to discontinue homebuilding operations in colorado and fresno  ca 
as of september   we have completed all homebuilding activities in these markets 
while the underlying basis for exiting each market was different  in each instance we concluded we could better serve shareholder interests by re allocating the capital employed in these markets 
the operating results of these markets that we have exited are included in loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in addition  as disclosed in our form k  the independent investigation  initiated in april by the audit committee of the board of directors the investigation and concluded in may  identified accounting and financial reporting errors and irregularities which resulted in the restatement of certain of our prior period consolidated financial statements and found evidence that employees of the company s beazer mortgage corporation beazer mortgage subsidiary  which voluntarily ceased operations in february  violated certain federal and or state regulations  including us department of housing and urban development hud regulations 
areas of concern uncovered by the investigation included our former practices in the areas of down payment assistance programs  the charging of discount points  the closure of certain hud licenses  closing accommodations  and the payment of a number of realtor bonuses and decorator allowances in certain federal housing administration fha insured loans and non fha conventional loans originated by beazer mortgage dating back to at least the investigation also uncovered limited improper practices in relation to the issuance of a number of non fha stated income loans 
we reviewed the loan documents and supporting documentation and determined that the assets were effectively isolated from the seller and its creditors even in the event of bankruptcy 
based on that information  management continues to believe that sale accounting at the time of the transfer of the loans to third parties was appropriate 
as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  on july   the company announced that it has resolved the criminal and civil investigations by the united states attorney s office in the western district of north carolina the us attorney and other state and federal agencies concerning matters that were the subject of the investigation discussed above 
based on the deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the us attorney and a settlement agreement with hud and the civil division of the department of justice and our settlement agreements with the north carolina real estate commission and north carolina office of the commissioner of banks  we recognized expense of approximately million in fiscal to cover payments that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable for fiscal years and under the terms of the dpa  the company s liability in each of 
table of contents the fiscal years after through a portion of fiscal unless extended as described in note will also be equal to of the company s adjusted ebitda as defined in the dpa 
the total amount of such obligations will be dependent on several factors  however  the maximum liability under the dpa and other settlement agreements discussed above will not exceed million 
as of september   we have paid million under the dpa and hud agreement and have accrued million for fiscal obligations 
while we believe that our accrual for this liability is adequate as of september   positive adjusted ebitda results in future years will require us to increase our accrual and incur additional expense in the future 
the housing and economic recovery act of hera was enacted into law on july  among other things  hera provided for a temporary first time home buyer tax credit for purchases made through july   reforms of fannie mae and freddie mac  including adjustments to the conforming loan limits  modernization and expansion of the fha  including an increase to in the minimum down payment required for fha loans  and the elimination of seller funded down payment assistance programs for fha loans approved after september  overall  hera was intended to help stabilize and add consumer confidence to the housing industry 
however  certain of the changes  such as the elimination of the down payment assistance programs and the increase in minimum down payments  have adversely impacted the ability of potential homebuyers to afford to purchase a new home or obtain financing 
the down payment assistance programs were utilized for a number of our home closings in fiscal the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted into law on october  eesa authorizes up to billion in new spending authority for the united states secretary of the treasury the secretary to purchase  manage and ultimately dispose of troubled assets 
the provisions of this law include an expansion of the hope for homeowners program 
this program allows the secretary to use loan guarantees and credit enhancements so that loans can be modified to prevent foreclosures 
also  the secretary can consent to term extensions  rate reductions and principal write downs 
federal agencies that own mortgage loans are directed to seek modifications prior to foreclosures 
in february  the  first time homebuyer tax credit was enacted into law 
this law enables homebuyers who have not owned a home in the past three years  subject to certain income limits  to receive a tax credit of of the purchase price of a home up to a maximum of  in november  this tax credit was extended by congress to june and the new law increased the annual income limits for qualification 
in addition  the new law also added a  tax credit for qualified existing homeowners who elect to purchase a new home 
certain states also enacted laws which enabled certain homebuyers to receive additional state tax credits 
availability of these tax credits appears to have incentivized certain homebuyers to purchase homes during the second half of fiscal  although it is not possible to quantify the precise impact 
in november  congress passed new net operating loss carry back legislation which extended the carryback period from two years to five years 
based on our preliminary estimates  we expect to apply for a cash tax refund of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal from carrying back net operating losses to our tax year 
outlook historically low interest rates  increased affordability and federal and state housing tax credits appear to have recently incented more prospective buyers to purchase a new home 
together with much lower levels of competition from private builders  these factors offer a slight hint of improvement  though it is premature to conclude that a sustainable recovery is underway 
foreclosures are still having by far the most damaging impact on the market 
in most of our markets  appraisals continue to be negatively impacted by foreclosure comparables which put additional pricing pressure on all home sales and limit financing availability 
as a result  we expect that fiscal will continue to pose challenges for us 
like many other homebuilders  we have experienced a material reduction in revenues and margins and we incurred significant net losses in fiscal through these net losses were driven primarily by asset impairment and lot option abandonment charges incurred in all three fiscal years 
this has resulted in a decrease in our stockholders equity from billion at september  to million at september  we believe that the homebuilding market will remain challenging into fiscal 
table of contents and  as a result  it is likely that we will also incur net losses in  which will further reduce our stockholders equity 
there were no amounts outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility at september  or  however  as of september   we had provided million of cash in addition to pledged real estate assets to supplementally collateralize our outstanding letters of credit of million under the secured revolving credit facility and three stand alone letter of credit facilities 
obligations to consummate offers to purchase of the original face amount of our non convertible senior notes at par may be triggered if our consolidated tangible net worth stockholders equity less intangible assets  as defined is less than million at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of september   our consolidated tangible net worth was million 
if triggered and fully subscribed in the future  this could result in our having to purchase a maximum of million of notes  based on the original amounts of the applicable notes  however  this amount may be reduced by certain senior note repurchases potentially at less than par made after the triggering date 
during fiscal  s p lowered the company s corporate credit rating to ccc and maintained its negative outlook 
s p also cut ratings on the company s senior unsecured notes to d given s p s expectation for additional discounted bond repurchases 
during fiscal  moody s lowered its rating to caa and reaffirmed its negative outlook  which is consistent with moody s methodology given a net loss situation 
on march   fitch lowered the company s issuer default rating from b to ccc and its senior notes from ccc rr to cc rr the rating agencies announced that these downgrades reflect continued deterioration in our homebuilding operations  credit metrics  other earnings based metrics and the significant decrease in our tangible net worth over the past year 
these ratings and our current credit condition affect  among other things  our ability to access new capital  especially debt  and may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt 
our credit ratings could be further lowered or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in particular  a further weakening of our financial condition  including any further increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows  could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds  result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook  or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing 
further  as of september   three of our joint ventures are in default or have received default notices under their debt agreements 
although neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries is the borrower of any of this joint venture debt  we have issued guarantees of various types with respect to a number of these joint ventures 
to the extent that we are unable to reach satisfactory resolutions  we may be called upon to perform under our applicable guarantees 
the estimated maximum exposure related to our debt repayment and loan to value maintenance guarantees was million at september  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our cash and cash equivalents at september  was million 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents as of september  and cash generated from our operations during fiscal will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during fiscal additionally  we may be able to reduce our investment in land and homes to generate further liquidity 
however  if we are required to fund all of the potential obligations associated with lower levels of stockholders equity  tangible net worth and joint venture defaults  we would have cash requirements totaling approximately million which would significantly reduce our overall liquidity 
as a result of these issues  in addition to our continued focus on generation and preservation of cash  we are also focused on increasing our stockholders equity and reducing our leverage 
in order to accomplish this goal  we will likely need to issue new common or preferred equity 
any new issuance may take the form of public or private offerings for cash  equity issued to consummate acquisitions of assets or equity issued in exchange for a portion of our outstanding debt 
in addition  we may from time to time continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity or other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions in the future on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents critical accounting policies some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
inventory valuation held for development our homebuilding inventories that are accounted for as held for development include land and home construction assets grouped together as communities 
homebuilding inventories held for development are stated at cost including direct construction costs  capitalized indirect costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we assess these assets no less than quarterly for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc 
for those communities for which construction and development activities are expected to occur in the future or have been idled land held for future development  all applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred and the inventory is stated at cost unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the future enactment of a development plan or the occurrence of events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
sfas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
generally  upon the commencement of land development activities  it may take three to five years depending on  among other things  the size of the community and its sales pace to fully develop  sell  construct and close all the homes in a typical community 
however  the impact of the recent downturn in our business has significantly lengthened the estimated life of many communities 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated are expected to be less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge should be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
we conduct a review of the recoverability of our homebuilding inventories held for development at the community level as factors indicate that an impairment may exist 
events and circumstances that might indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  adverse trends in new orders  higher than anticipated cancellations  declining margins  which might result from the need to offer incentives to new homebuyers to drive sales or price reductions to respond to actions taken by our competitors  economic factors specific to the markets in which we operate  including fluctuations in employment levels  population growth  or levels of new and resale homes for sale in the marketplace and a decline in the availability of credit across all industries 
as a result  we evaluate  among other things  the following information for each community actual net contribution margin defined as homebuilding revenues less homebuilding costs and direct selling expenses for homes closed in the current fiscal quarter  fiscal year to date and prior two fiscal quarters 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
direct selling expenses include commissions  closing costs and amortization related to model home furnishings and improvements  projected net contribution margin for homes in backlog  actual and trending new orders and cancellation rates  actual and trending base home sales prices and sales incentives for home sales that occurred in the prior two fiscal quarters that remain in backlog at the end of the fiscal quarter and expected future 
table of contents homes sales prices and sales incentives and absorption over the expected remaining life of the community  a comparison of our community to our competition to include  among other things  an analysis of various product offerings including  the size and style of the homes currently offered for sale  community amenity levels  availability of lots in our community and our competition s  desirability and uniqueness of our community and other market factors  and other events that may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of a community that we have evaluated as requiring a test for impairment  significant quantitative and qualitative assumptions are made relative to the future home sales prices  sales incentives  direct and indirect costs of home construction and land development and the pace of new home orders 
in addition  these assumptions are dependent upon the specific market conditions and competitive factors for each specific community and may differ greatly between communities within the same market and communities in different markets 
our estimates are made using information available at the date of the recoverability test  however  as facts and circumstances may change in future reporting periods  our estimates of recoverability are subject to change 
for assets in communities for which the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the carrying value of that community is written down to its then estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
the carrying value of assets in communities that were previously impaired and continue to be classified as held for development is not written up for future estimates of increases in fair value in future reporting periods 
market deterioration that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges on previously impaired homebuilding assets in addition to homebuilding assets not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if the market continues to deteriorate 
the fair value of the homebuilding inventory held for development is estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying community assets 
the discount rate used may be different for each community 
the factors considered when determining an appropriate discount rate for a community include  among others community specific factors such as the number of lots in the community  the status of land development in the community  the competitive factors influencing the sales performance of the community and overall market factors such as employment levels  consumer confidence and the existing supply of new and used homes for sale 
the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow models are specific to each community tested for impairment 
historically  these assumptions did not include market improvements except in limited circumstances in the latter years of long lived communities 
our assumptions assume limited market improvements in some communities beginning in fiscal and continuing improvement in these communities in subsequent years 
we assumed the remaining communities would have market improvements beginning in fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   we used discount rates of to in our estimated discounted cash flow impairment calculations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairments of our inventory of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for land under development and homes under construction for our continuing operations 
impairments of inventory previously held for development related to our discontinued operations were  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to projected home sales prices and absorption rates  the timing and amount of the estimated future cash flows and discount rates  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and absorption rates require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of inventory held for development that were evaluated for impairment based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management relative to future results 
because our projected cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ materially from our estimates and result in additional impairments 

table of contents asset valuation land held for sale we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell in accordance with sfas the following criteria are used to determine if land is held for sale management has the authority and commits to a plan to sell the land  the land is available for immediate sale in its present condition  there is an active program to locate a buyer and the plan to sell the property has been initiated  the sale of the land is probable within one year  the property is being actively marketed at a reasonable sale price relative to its current fair value  and it is unlikely that the plan to sell will be withdrawn or that significant changes to the plan will be made 
additionally  in certain circumstances  management will re evaluate the best use of an asset that is currently being accounted for as held for development 
in such instances  management will review  among other things  the current and projected competitive circumstances of the community  including the level of supply of new and used inventory  the level of sales absorptions by us and our competition  the level of sales incentives required and the number of owned lots remaining in the community 
based on this review  if the foregoing criteria have been met at the end of the applicable reporting period and we believe that the best use of the asset is the sale of all or a portion of the asset in its current condition  then all or portions of the community are accounted for as held for sale 
in determining the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  we considered factors including current sales prices for comparable assets in the area  recent market analysis studies  appraisals  any recent legitimate offers  and listing prices of similar properties 
if the estimated fair value less cost to sell of an asset is less than its current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
during fiscal  and  we recorded inventory impairments on land held for sale by our continuing operations of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
land held for sale inventory impairments related to our discontinued operations totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about land sales prices require significant judgment because the current market is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of land held for sale based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results and may result in additional impairments if market conditions continue to deteriorate 
homebuilding revenues and costs revenue from the sale of a home is generally recognized when the closing has occurred and the risk of ownership is transferred to the buyer 
as appropriate  revenue for condominiums under construction is recognized based on the percentage of completion method in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate asc  when certain criteria are met 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
sales commissions are included in selling  general and administrative expense when the closing has occurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
warranty reserves we currently provide a limited warranty ranging from one to two years covering workmanship and materials per our defined performance quality standards 
in addition  we provide a limited warranty generally ranging from a minimum of five years up to the period covered by the applicable statute of repose covering only certain defined construction defects 
we also provide a defined structural element warranty with single family homes and townhomes in certain states 

table of contents since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors who generally provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work  claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of our subcontractors 
warranty reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record reserves covering our anticipated warranty expense for each home closed 
management reviews the adequacy of warranty reserves each reporting period  based on historical experience and management s estimate of the costs to remediate the claims  and adjusts these provisions accordingly 
our review includes a quarterly analysis of the historical data and trends in warranty expense by operating segment 
an analysis by operating segment allows us to consider market specific factors such as our warranty experience  the number of home closings  the prices of homes  product mix and other data in estimating our warranty reserves 
in addition  our analysis also contemplates the existence of any non recurring or community specific warranty related matters that might not be contemplated in our historical data and trends 
as a result of our analyses  we adjust our estimated warranty liabilities 
based on historical results  we believe that our existing estimation process is accurate and do not anticipate the process to materially change in the future 
our estimation process for such accruals is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that our warranty reserves at september  are adequate  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs or that future developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we periodically enter into joint ventures with unrelated developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
we have determined that our interest in these joint ventures should be accounted for under the equity method as prescribed by sop  accounting for investments in real estate ventures asc 
we recognize our share of profits and losses from the sale of lots to other buyers 
our share of profits from lots purchased by beazer homes from the joint ventures are deferred and treated as a reduction of the cost of the land purchased from the joint venture 
such profits are subsequently recognized at the time the home closes and title passes to the homebuyer 
we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock asc 
a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary 
the amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
our assumptions of the joint venture s estimated fair value is dependent on market conditions 
inventory in the joint venture is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities in accordance with sfas if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity in accordance with sfas  our proportionate share of it is reflected in our equity in income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities 
the operating results of the unconsolidated joint ventures are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry  which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates  credit availability  unemployment levels and consumer sentiment 
changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities 
because of these changes in economic conditions  actual results could differ materially from management s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future 
during fiscal  and  we wrote down our investment in certain of our joint ventures reflecting million  million and million  respectively  of impairments of inventory held within those ventures 
these charges are included in equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying statement of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in addition  for fiscal and  respectively  there were million and million of joint venture impairments related to certain homebuilding operations in our discontinued operations and  as a result  have been included in loss from discontinued operations  net in the accompanying statement of operations 
while we believe that no additional impairment of our unconsolidated joint venture investments existed as of september   market deterioration or 
table of contents changes in estimated future cash flows that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges 
as of september   our remaining investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaled million 
income taxes valuation allowance judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes asc  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the sfas more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  the section limitation on our ability to carryforward pre ownership change net operating losses and recognized built in losses or deductions  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for the valuation of deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during fiscal  we determined that it was not more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized and  therefore  we established a valuation allowance of million for substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
we have not changed our assessment regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax assets as of september  and consequently  during the fiscal year ended september   we determined that an additional valuation allowance of million was warranted 
as of september   our deferred tax valuation allowance was million 
management reassesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets each reporting period 
to the extent that our results of operations improve and deferred tax assets become realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced and result in a non cash tax benefit 
we experienced an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code as of december  section contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses or deductions recognized during the five year period after the ownership change 
therefore  our ability to utilize our pre ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and recognize certain built in losses or deductions is limited by section to a maximum amount of approximately million annually 
at september   we estimated that approximately million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards are not subject to the annual limitation imposed by section in addition  we have estimated that approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards are subject to the annual limitation imposed by section furthermore  we estimated that approximately million of unrecognized built in losses as of september  that  if recognized before january  would also be subject to the annual limitation triggered by the section ownership change at december  although our board of directors recently adopted a shareholder rights plan on july  which is intended to reduce the likelihood of an unintended ownership change within the meaning of section and thereby protect stockholder value by preserving our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards  the shareholder rights plan does not ensure that our net operating loss carryforwards will be protected from an ownership change as defined in 
table of contents the tax laws  and there can be no assurance that such an ownership change will not occur 
if another ownership change occurs  a new annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses would be determined on that date 
seasonal and quarterly variability our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
however  beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing through the first two quarters of fiscal  we continued to experience challenging conditions in most of our markets which contributed to decreased revenues and closings as compared to prior periods including prior quarters  thereby reducing typical seasonal variations

during fiscal  all of the homebuilding operating activities in the markets we have exited have ceased 
on february   we determined that we would discontinue our mortgage origination services through beazer mortgage corporation bmc 
as of september   all of bmc operating activities had ceased 
we have classified the results of operations of bmc  previously included in our financial services segment  and our exit markets  previously included in our other homebuilding segment  as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
all statement of operations information in the table above and the management discussion and analysis that follow exclude the results of discontinued operations 
discontinued operations were not segregated in the consolidated statements of cash flows or the consolidated balance sheets 
total revenue from discontinued operations was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively

fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues 
the continued deterioration of the housing industry contributed to a decrease in homebuilding revenues and a decrease in homes closed from fiscal primarily due to the tightening of mortgage credit availability  an increase in home foreclosures and other economic factors that impacted consumer homebuyers 
foreclosures are still having the most damaging impact on the market 
in every market  appraisals continue to be negatively impacted by foreclosure comparables which put further pricing pressure on all home sales and limit financing availability 
the decline in closings was especially pronounced in all of the markets in our southeast segment and our nevada  north carolina and tennessee markets 
the average sales price of homes closed decreased by to  from  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
average sales price decreased most significantly in our florida  nevada  virginia  maryland  new jersey and california markets  due primarily to increased price competition and subsequent price discounting and increasing sales incentives related to the challenging market conditions  including the increased number of foreclosed homes on the market at below average sales prices 
in addition  we had million and million of land sales for the fiscal years ended september  and respectively 
fiscal land and lot sales primarily resulted from our sale of two condominium projects in virginia to third parties 
gross profit loss 
gross margin for fiscal was without million of impairments and abandonments compared to a gross margin of for fiscal without million of impairments and abandonments 
while we have begun to see signs that some negative market trends may be moderating at both local and national levels  key macroeconomic indicators remain soft or mixed and gross margins continued to be negatively impacted by continued market weakness in the homebuilding industry 
the improvement in gross margin was directly related to a reduction in non cash pre tax inventory impairments and option contract abandonments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as well as from cost reductions related to our cost control initiatives including renegotiated vendor pricing where possible 
in our continued efforts to redeploy assets to more profitable endeavors  we executed several land sales during the past two fiscal years 
we realized minimal profit on land sales of million in fiscal compared to a gain on land sales of million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expense during the periods presented is primarily related to cost reductions realized as a result of our comprehensive review and realignment of our overhead structure in light of our reduced volume expectations and lower sales commissions related to decreased revenues  and decreased investigation related costs and severance costs offset partially by approximately million of expense for obligations related to the government investigations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal and sg a expense included million and million in severance costs related to employees who had been severed as of september of the respective year 
in addition  fiscal and sg a expense included million and million  respectively of government investigation related costs  including the million obligation discussed above 
as of september   we had 
table of contents reduced our overall number of employees by or as compared to september   or a cumulative reduction of since september  as a percentage of total revenue  sg a expenses were in fiscal excluding the investigation related costs and in fiscal excluding the investigation related costs 
the increase in sg a costs as a percentage of total revenue is primarily related to the aforementioned investigative and severance costs and the impact of fixed overhead expenses on reduced revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization d a totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in d a during the periods presented is primarily related to reduced spending on model furnishings and sales office improvements as a result of our strategic review of our communities and reduction in headcount 
goodwill impairment charges 
the company experienced a significant decline in its market capitalization during first quarter of fiscal as of december   we considered current and expected future market conditions and recorded a pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal related to our reporting units in maryland  houston  texas and nashville  tennessee 
as a result of this impairment charge  we have no goodwill remaining as of september  in fiscal  in light of continuing market weakness  significantly reduced new orders  additional pricing pressures and additional incentives provided to homebuyers  our reforecasting of expected future results of operations and increasing inventory charges  we recorded pretax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our reporting units in arizona  new jersey  southern california and virginia 
in fiscal  we recorded pretax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our reporting units in nevada  northern california  florida and certain of our reporting units in south carolina 
the goodwill impairment charges were based on estimates of the fair value of the underlying assets of the reporting units 
joint venture impairment charges 
as a result of the further deterioration of the housing market in fiscal and the first half of fiscal and the settlement of guarantees under debt obligations of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we recorded impairments in certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures totaling million and million in fiscal and  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements where further discussed 
if these adverse market conditions continue or worsen  we may have to take further impairments of our investments in these joint ventures that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
during the second half of fiscal  we voluntarily repurchased in open market transactions million principal amount of our senior notes 
the aggregate purchase price was million  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date 
the repurchase of these notes resulted in a million pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt  net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs related to these notes 
during fiscal  we also negotiated a reduced payoff for one of our other secured notes payable totaling million and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of million related to the repayment of this note 
income taxes 
as we are in a cumulative loss position  as analyzed under sfas  and based on the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  we recorded an additional valuation allowances of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  for substantially all of our deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations was for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal and were impacted by million and million of non cash goodwill impairment charges discussed above 
the change in our effective tax rate between years is primarily due to our valuation allowances  state income taxes incurred  non deductible goodwill impairment charges and adjustments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
the principal difference between our effective rate and the us federal statutory rate in fiscal and is due to our valuation allowance  state income taxes incurred and certain non deductible goodwill impairment charges million and million were non tax deductible in fiscal and  respectively

the table below summarizes homebuilding revenues  the average selling prices of our homes and closings by reportable segment in thousands homebuilding revenues average selling price closings change change change west east southeast total homebuilding revenues decreased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal due to decreased closings in the majority of our markets  related to reduced demand  excess capacity in both new and resale markets including increased foreclosures available at lower prices as investors continued to divest of prior home purchases and potential homebuyers have difficulty selling their homes and or obtaining financing 
in addition  credit tightening in the mortgage markets  increased unemployment and a decline in consumer confidence in the majority of our markets further compounded the market pressures during the fiscal year specifically  homebuilding revenues in the west segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal due to reduced average sales prices and reduced demand in the majority of the markets in this segment due to deteriorating market conditions and excess capacity in both the new home and resale markets 
in addition  credit tightening in the mortgage markets and a decline in consumer confidence in all of our markets further compounded the market deterioration in our nevada  california  texas and arizona markets in our west segment 
for the fiscal year ended september   our east segment homebuilding revenues decreased by driven by a decline in closings and a decline in average sales prices which was particularly pronounced in our maryland  new jersey and tennessee  virginia markets 
these declines reflect the impact of excess capacity in the resale markets  the impact of credit tightening in the mortgage markets  competitive pricing pressures and a decline in consumer confidence 
our southeast segment continued to be challenged by significant declines in demand and excess capacity in both the new home and resale markets and high foreclosures  especially in our georgia and florida markets  driving decreases in homebuilding revenues of for fiscal as compared to fiscal home closings in the southeast segment decreased by from the prior year due to deteriorating market conditions and competitive pressures 
the decrease in closings was driven by lower demand  higher available supply of new and resale inventory  increased competition and the tightening of credit requirements and decreased availability of mortgage options for potential homebuyers

corporate and unallocated 
corporate and unallocated costs include the amortization of capitalized interest and indirect construction costs 
the decrease in corporate and unallocated costs relates primarily to a reduction of approximately million in investigation related costs given the resolution of the previously disclosed investigations despite million of expense related to our obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements  a reduction of million in the amortization of capitalized interest costs due to a lower capitalizable inventory base and an increase in disallowed interest for capitalization which is recorded as other expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and a reduction of million in expenses related to the impairment of capitalized interest and indirect costs in connection with the reduced level of inventory impairments in fiscal compared to fiscal land and lot sales gross profit loss

the inventory held for development that was impaired during fiscal represented  lots in communities with an estimated fair value of million 
during fiscal  for certain communities we determined it was prudent to reduce sales prices or further increase sales incentives in response to factors including competitive market conditions 
because the projected cash flows used to evaluate the fair value of inventory are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions including decreased sales prices  the change in sales prices and changes in absorption estimates led to additional impairments in certain communities during the fiscal year 
in future periods  we may again determine that it is prudent to reduce sales prices  further increase sales incentives or reduce absorption rates which may lead to additional impairments  which could be material 
the impairments recorded on our held for development inventory for the fiscal years ended september  and  primarily resulted from the continued decline in the homebuilding environment across our submarkets 
during fiscal and  as a result of challenging market conditions and review of recent comparable transactions  certain of the company s land held for sale was further written down to net realizable value  less estimated costs to sell 
as a result  we recorded million and million of impairments on land during fiscal and  respectively 
we have determined the proper course of action with respect to a number of communities within each homebuilding segment was to abandon the remaining lots under option and to write off the deposits securing the option takedowns  as well as preacquisition costs 
we recorded lot option abandonment charges during the fiscal years ended september  and of million and million  respectively 
the abandonment charges relate to our decision to abandon certain option contracts that no longer fit in our long term strategic plan and related to our prior year decision to exit certain markets 

table of contents inventory impairments recorded on a quarterly basis during fiscal  the estimated fair value of impaired inventory at period end  the number of lots and number of communities impaired are set forth in the table below as follows in thousands estimated fair inventory impairments value of impaired held for held for inventory at period lots communities quarter ended development sale total end impaired impaired december  march  june  september  fiscal unit data by segment new orders  net cancellation rates change west east southeast total new orders and backlog new orders  net of cancellations  decreased to  units during fiscal compared to  units for the same period in the prior year driven by weaker market conditions  including the tightening of mortgage credit availability  an increase in home foreclosures and other economic factors that have impacted homebuyers 
our third and fourth quarter fiscal net new orders reflect a sequential improvement in sales trends that we have experienced recently 
historically low interest rates  increased affordability and federal and state housing tax credits appear to have enticed more prospective buyers to purchase a new home  however  foreclosures are still having a damaging impact on the market 
in most of our markets  appraisals continue to be negatively impacted by foreclosure comparables which put additional pricing pressures on all home sales and limit financing availability 
for fiscal  we experienced cancellation rates of compared to for fiscal these cancellation rates in both fiscal and reflect the continued challenging market environment which includes the inability of many potential homebuyers to sell their existing homes and obtain affordable financing 
in addition  on july   we completed the sale of two large condominium projects in virginia  which resulted in the cancellation of orders for fiscal  and the significant increase in the cancellation rate for our east segment 
excluding these transactions  our cancellation rates in the east segment and total continuing operations were and  respectively  for fiscal the decrease in cancellation rates across all markets reflects competitive pricing and a trend in the current environment that buyers are only willing to contract on a new home once their current home sells 
backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which the company has entered into a sales contract with a customer but has not yet delivered the home 
the aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog for our continuing operations at september  of million decreased from million at september   related to a decrease in the number of homes in backlog from  units at september  to  units at september  the decrease in the number of homes in backlog across our west and southeast markets is driven primarily by the aforementioned market weakness and lower new orders 

table of contents backlog at september  change west east southeast total backlog has declined in many of our homebuilding markets due primarily to lower new orders caused by a competitive environment  increased foreclosures  the reduction in the availability of mortgage credit for our potential homebuyers and our decision to sell certain large projects 
foreclosures are still having by far the most damaging impact on the market 
particularly in our southeast and nevada markets  appraisals continue to be negatively impacted by foreclosure comparables which put additional pricing pressure on all home sales and limit financing availability 
as the availability of mortgage loans stabilizes and the inventory of new and used homes decreases  backlog should increase  however  continued reduced levels of backlog will produce less revenue in the future which could also result in additional asset impairment charges and lower levels of liquidity 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues 
the continued deterioration of the housing industry contributed to a decrease in homebuilding revenues from fiscal compared to fiscal homes closed decreased by to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as excessive levels of new and resale home supplies  tightening of mortgage credit availability and other economic factors impacted consumer homebuyers 
this decline was especially pronounced in our california  nevada  arizona  new jersey  south carolina and florida markets 
the average sales price of homes closed decreased by to  from  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
average sales price decreased most significantly in our florida  nevada and california markets  due primarily to increased price competition and subsequent price discounting and increasing sales incentives related to the challenging market conditions  including the increased number of foreclosed homes on the market at below average sales prices 
in addition  we had million and million of land sales for the fiscal years ended september  and respectively 
the increase in land sales in fiscal primarily resulted from our sale of two condominium projects in virginia 
gross profit loss 
gross margin for fiscal was compared to a gross margin of for fiscal driven by market weakness resulting in lower revenues 
gross margins for both periods were significantly impacted by non cash pre tax inventory impairments and option contract abandonments of million in fiscal compared to million recognized in fiscal gross margins for fiscal continued to be negatively impacted by both higher levels of price discounting and sales incentives as compared to the same period a year ago 
in response to these market conditions and based on our internal analyses and business decisions  we incurred non cash  pretax charges of million for inventory impairments and million for the abandonment of certain land option contracts during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million of inventory impairments and million for the abandonment of land option contracts 
gross profit also includes a reduction in the accrual and costs related to the trinity class action litigation settlement of million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in an effort to redeploy assets to more profitable endeavors  we executed several land sales during the past two fiscal years 
we realized a gain on land sales of million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expense during the periods presented is primarily related to cost reductions realized as a result of our comprehensive review and realignment of our overhead structure in light of our reduced volume expectations and lower sales commissions related to decreased revenues  offset by increased costs related to investigation related costs and severance costs

in fiscal  we recorded pretax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our reporting units in nevada  northern california  florida and certain of our reporting units in south carolina 
the goodwill impairment charges were based on estimates of the fair value of the underlying assets of the reporting units 
these charges are reported in corporate and unallocated and are not allocated to our homebuilding segments 
to the extent that there is further deterioration in market conditions or overall economic conditions or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding fair value of reporting units which are currently not impaired could change  which could result in future goodwill impairments that have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal  we voluntarily repurchased million of our outstanding senior notes on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date 
the repurchase of these notes resulted in a net  pretax loss on extinguishment of debt 
joint venture impairment charges 
as of september   we participated in certain land development joint ventures in which we had less than a controlling interest 
our joint ventures are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
as a result of the deterioration of the housing market in fiscal  we wrote down our investment in certain of our joint ventures reflecting million of impairments of inventory held within those joint ventures 
joint venture impairments of million and million of contractual obligation abandonments were recorded in fiscal if these adverse market conditions continue or worsen  we may have to take further writedowns of our investments in these joint ventures that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations

the inventory held for development that was impaired during fiscal represented  lots in communities with an estimated fair value of million 
the impairments recorded on our held for development inventory  for all segments  primarily resulted from the continued significant decline in the homebuilding environment that negatively impacted the sales prices of homes and increased the sales incentives offered to potential homebuyers in our efforts to increase home sales absorptions 
in addition  the homebuilding markets that comprise our west segment consist of markets that once experienced the most significant home price appreciation in the nation during the through periods which was driven in large part by speculative purchases and the availability of mortgage credit during those time periods which are significantly less available in the marketplace 
the decline in the availability of mortgage loan products and the exit of speculators from the market  among other factors  contributed to the significant increase in the supply of new and used homes on the market for sale 
we have also recorded million and million of impairments on land during fiscal and  respectively that we have determined does not fit within our homebuilding needs in the current environment and have thus classified as held for sale 
the impairments recorded on our land held for sale  for all segments  primarily resulted from the continued significant decline in the homebuilding environment as discussed above 
in addition  based on the significant decline in the homebuilding market  we have determined the proper course of action with respect to a number of communities within each homebuilding segment was to abandon the remaining lots under option and to write off the deposits securing the option takedowns  as well as preacquisition costs

as the homebuilding market declined  we were successful in significantly reducing our land bank through the abandonment of lot option contracts  the sale of land assets not required in our homebuilding program and through the sale of new homes 
the decrease in the number of owned lots in our land bank from september  related to our decision to eliminate non strategic positions to align our land supply with our expectations for future home closings 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal  as we strategically increased our investment in certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures and were required to increase the amount of cash restricted under our revolving credit and letter of credit facilities by million in fiscal specifically  during fiscal  we reduced the size of our secured revolving credit facility to million and entered into three stand alone  cash secured letter of credit agreements with banks 
these facilities will continue to provide for future working capital and letter of credit needs collateralized by either cash or assets of the company at our option  based on certain conditions and covenant compliance 
as of september   we have secured our letters of credit under these facilities using cash collateral which is maintained in restricted accounts of million

to finance land purchases  we may also use seller  or third party financed non recourse secured notes payable  subject to certain limits as defined in our senior notes and senior secured notes 
as of september  and  such secured notes payable outstanding totaled million and million  respectively 
as the homebuilding markets have contracted over the past few years  we continued to decrease the size of our business through a reduction in personnel and the closeout of additional communities 
as the markets begin to recover  we will continue our focus on cash generation and preservation to ensure we have the required liquidity to fund our operations and to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they are presented 
we fulfill our short term cash requirements with cash generated from our operations 
there were no amounts outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility at september  or september   however  we had and million of letters of credit outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility or stand alone letter of credit facilities at september  and september   respectively 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents at september  of million  cash generated from our operations and availability of new debt and equity financing  if any  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during fiscal however  if we are required to fund all of the potential obligations associated with lower levels of stockholders equity and joint venture defaults  we would have cash requirements totaling approximately million which would significantly reduce our overall liquidity 
as a result of these issues  in addition to our continued focus on generation and preservation of cash  we are also focused on increasing our stockholders equity and reducing our leverage 
in order to accomplish this goal  we will likely need to issue new common or preferred equity 
any new issuance may take the form of public or private offerings for cash  equity issued to consummate acquisitions of assets or equity issued in exchange for a portion of our outstanding debt 
we may also from time to time seek to continue to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity or other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
in addition  any material variance from our projected operating results or land investments  or investments in or acquisitions of businesses  or amounts paid to fulfill obligations with governmental entities  could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
any such equity transactions or debt financing may be on terms less favorable or at higher costs than our current financing sources  depending on future market conditions and other factors including any possible downgrades in our credit ratings or adverse commentaries issued by rating agencies in the future 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions in the future on favorable terms or at all 
stock repurchases and dividends paid the company did not repurchase any shares in the open market during fiscal  or at september   there are approximately million additional shares available for purchase pursuant to the company s stock repurchase plan 
however  we have currently suspended our repurchase program and any resumption of such program will be at the discretion of the board of directors and as allowed by our debt covenants and is unlikely in the foreseeable future 
on november   our board of directors suspended payment of quarterly dividends 
the board concluded that suspending dividends  which will allow us to conserve approximately million of cash annually  was a prudent effort in light of the continued deterioration of the housing market 
in addition  the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
at september   under the most restrictive covenants of each indenture  none of our retained earnings was available for cash dividends 
hence  there were no dividends paid in either fiscal or for fiscal  we paid quarterly cash dividends of per common share  or a total of approximately million

we owned  or  lots  and  lots   were under option contracts which generally require the payment of cash or the posting of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a certain price 
we historically have attempted to control a portion of our land supply through options 
as a result of the flexibility that these options provide us  upon a change in market conditions we may renegotiate the terms of the options prior to exercise or terminate the agreement 
under option contracts  purchase of the properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers and our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the non refundable deposits  letters of credit and other non refundable amounts incurred  which aggregated approximately million at september  this amount includes non refundable letters of credit of approximately million 
the total remaining purchase price  net of cash deposits  committed under all options was million as of september  we expect to exercise  subject to market conditions  most of our option contracts 
various factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as market conditions  weather conditions and the timing of the completion of development activities  will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether land options will be exercised 
we have historically funded the exercise of land options through a combination of operating cash flows 
we expect these sources to continue to be adequate to fund anticipated future option exercises 
therefore  we do not anticipate that the exercise of our land options will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
certain of our option contracts are with sellers who are deemed to be variable interest entities vies under fasb interpretation no

fin r asc 
we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts 
our risk is generally limited to the option deposits that we pay  and creditors of the sellers generally have no recourse to the general credit of the company 
although we do not have legal title to the optioned land  for those option contracts for which we are the primary beneficiary  we are required to consolidate the land under option at fair value 
we believe that the exercise prices of our option contracts approximate their fair value 
our consolidated balance sheets at september  and reflect consolidated inventory not owned of million and million  respectively 
obligations related to consolidated inventory not owned totaled million at september  and million at september  the difference between the balances of consolidated inventory not owned and obligations related to consolidated inventory not owned represents cash deposits paid under the option agreements 
when market conditions improve  we may expand our use of option agreements to supplement our owned inventory supply 
we participate in a number of land development joint ventures in which we have less than a controlling interest 
we enter into joint ventures in order to acquire attractive land positions  to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base 
our joint ventures are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
we account for our interest in these joint ventures under the equity method 
our consolidated balance sheets include investments in joint ventures totaling million and million at september  and  respectively 
our joint ventures typically obtain secured acquisition and development financing 
at september   our unconsolidated joint ventures had borrowings outstanding totaling million  of which million related to one joint venture in which we are a partner 
generally  we and our joint venture partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt or other obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
at september   we had repayment guarantees of million and loan to value maintenance guarantees of million of debt of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
three of our unconsolidated joint ventures are in default or have received default notices under their debt agreements at september  to the extent that we are unable to reach satisfactory resolutions  we may be called upon to perform under our applicable guarantees

table of contents the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at september  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years senior notes  senior secured notes other notes payable interest commitments under senior notes  senior secured notes other notes payable operating leases uncertain tax positions total interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of september  due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for the remaining tax liabilities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits as of september  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s unrecognized tax benefits as of september  we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at september  related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments in addition to the letters of credit of approximately million relating to our land option contracts discussed above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe that our exposure in this area is material to cash flows or earnings 
as of september   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
based on our fiscal average outstanding borrowings under our variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would negatively impact our annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at september  was billion  compared to a carrying value of billion  due primarily to increases in our estimated discount rates for similar financial instruments 
in addition  the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our estimated discount rates would increase the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments from billion to billion at september
