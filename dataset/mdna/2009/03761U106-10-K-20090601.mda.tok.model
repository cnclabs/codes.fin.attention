overview apollo investment was incorporated under the maryland general corporation law in february we have elected to be treated as a bdc under the act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a ric  we generally do not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders 
apollo investment commenced operations on april  upon completion of its initial public offering that raised million in net proceeds selling million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
since then  and through march   we have raised approximately billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock 
investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive 
table of contents environment for the types of investments we make 
as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
pursuant to rules adopted in  the sec expanded the definition of eligible portfolio company to include certain public companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange 
the sec recently adopted an additional new rule under the act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company to include companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than million 
this new rule became effective july  revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the debt and preferred securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans  generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate 
while us subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of these investments may include zero coupon  payment in kind pik and or step up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or pik 
the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of dividends paid to us on common equity investments as well as revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and  if applicable  consulting fees  etc 
expenses all investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff  when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us  and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by aim 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to investment advisory and management fees  expenses incurred by aim payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  calculation of our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm  direct costs and expenses of administration  including independent registered public accounting and legal costs  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the sec  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  offerings of our common stock and other securities  registration and listing fees  fees payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  relating to  or associated with  evaluating and making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  taxes  independent directors fees and expenses

we expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms 
during periods of asset growth  we expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities  among others  may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance  benchmarks libor and euribor  and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods  among other factors 
portfolio and investment activity during our fiscal year ended march   we invested million across new and existing portfolio companies 
this compares to investing billion in new and existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended march  investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended march  totaled million versus million for the fiscal year ended march  at march   our net portfolio consisted of portfolio companies and was invested in senior secured loans  in subordinated debt  in preferred equity and in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus portfolio companies invested in senior secured loans  in subordinated debt  in preferred equity and in common equity and warrants at march  the weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio  subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were  and  respectively  at march  at march   the yields were   and  respectively 
since the initial public offering of apollo investment corporation in april and through march   invested capital totals billion in portfolio companies 
over the same period  apollo investment has also completed transactions with more than different financial sponsors 
senior secured loans and european mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate  with stated maturities at origination that typically range from to years 
while subordinated debt issued within the united states will typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of these investments may include zero coupon  pik and or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
at march   or billion of our interest bearing investment portfolio is fixed rate debt and or billion is floating rate debt  measured at fair value 
at march   or billion of our interest bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and or billion was floating rate debt 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make 
table of contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments under procedures established by our board of directors  we value investments  including certain subordinated debt  senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than days  for which market quotations are readily available  at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair value 
we typically obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers if available  otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service 
we utilize mid market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative 
if and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  we typically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value 
given the general market dislocation  the lack of trading activity and the forced sellers we noted in the market during the fiscal year ended march   our research and diligence concluded that the limited but available market quotations on a number of performing or outperforming credits may not be representative of fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the us accordingly  such investments went through our multi step valuation process as described below 
in each case  our independent valuation firms considered observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such level categorized assets 
investments maturing in days or less are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates fair value 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our investment adviser  independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors conduct independent appraisals and review our investment adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee 
investments are valued utilizing a market approach  an income approach  or both approaches  as appropriate 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities including a business 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include  as relevant available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading 
table of contents and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  m a comparables  our principal market as the reporting entity and enterprise values  among other factors 
in september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
we adopted this statement for our first fiscal quarter ended june  sfas no 
classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by the company at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
on october   fasb staff position determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fas was issued 
fas provides examples of how to determine fair value in a market that is not active 
fas did not change the fair value measurement principles set forth in fas furthermore  on april   fasb staff position determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fas was issued 
fas provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with sfas when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
fas also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
according to fas  in the above circumstances  more analysis and significant adjustments to transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value 
fas is effective for periods ending after june  we are currently reviewing fas and the future impact  if any  it will have on our financial position or results of operations 
revenue recognition we record interest and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and securities with contractual pik interest or dividends  which represents contractual interest or dividends accrued and added to the balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we may not accrue pik income if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the pik income is not collectible  among other factors 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income 
upon the prepayment of a loan or security  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as interest income when we receive such amounts 

table of contents net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
results of operations results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  investment income for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   gross investment income totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to changes in the composition of the portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year

for the fiscal year ended march   net change in unrealized appreciation on the company s investments  cash equivalents  foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled million 
a material increase in unrealized depreciation was recognized for the most recent fiscal year from significantly lower fair value determinations on many of our investments 
lower fair values were driven primarily from the general market dislocation  the illiquid capital markets  and the current market expectations for pricing increased credit risk and default assumptions 
net increase decrease in net assets from operations for the fiscal years ended march  and  the company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of million and million  respectively

at march   the company had billion in borrowings outstanding and billion of unused capacity 
given our asset coverage requirements  use of the capital resources available to us has been significantly curtailed due to the effect of unrealized depreciation on our leverage ratio 
in addition  we currently expect any present liquidity needs to be met from continued cash flows from operations and investment sales and prepayments  among other actions 
in the future  the company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration  among other considerations 
the primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies  cash distributions to our stockholders  reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes

the junior note generally entitles apollo fdc to the net interest and other proceeds due under the fdc reference obligation after payment of interest due under the senior notes  as described above 
in addition  apollo fdc is entitled to of any realized appreciation in the fdc reference obligation and  since the senior note is a non recourse obligation  is exposed up to the amount of equity used by aic holdco to fund the purchase of the junior note plus any additional margin apollo decides to post  if any  during the term of the financing

the senior note  total return swap and acquisition loan are non recourse to aic holdco  its subsidiaries and us and have standard events of default including failure to pay contractual amounts when due and failure by each of the underlying apollo special purpose entities to provide additional credit support  sell assets or prepay a portion of its obligations if the value of the fdc reference obligation  the txu reference obligation or the boots reference obligation  as applicable  declines below specified levels

table of contents the following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively declared dividends fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions 
also  our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company 
with respect to the dividends paid to stockholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
for the fiscal years ended march   and upfront fees totaling million  million and million  respectively  are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans to the extent such loans remain outstanding 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended march   many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on floating libor and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
as the percentage of our us mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments  we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates 
at march   our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities were closely matched 
as such  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our net investment income 
however  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the fiscal year ended march   we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
