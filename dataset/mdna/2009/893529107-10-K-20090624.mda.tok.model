overview operational overview 
we are a leading global distributor of professional grade test and measurement instruments and accredited provider of calibration  parts inspection  production model engineering and repair services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are distribution products and calibration services 
in our product segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement instruments 
additionally  because we specialize in test and measurement instruments  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to aid them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
sales in our product segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as industrial customers increase or curtail capital and discretionary spending  our product sales will typically be directly impacted 
the majority of our products are not consumables  but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product lines or channels of distribution 
our strength in our service segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration and repair of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
we believe our service segment offers an opportunity for long term growth and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers with regular calibration cycles 
we evaluate revenue growth in both of our business segments against a four quarter trend analysis  and not by analyzing any single quarter 

table of contents financial overview 
in evaluating our results for fiscal year  the following factors should be taken into account fiscal year and fiscal year operating results include weeks compared with weeks for fiscal year fiscal year operating results include those of westcon  a test and measurement instrument distributor and calibration laboratory  from the date of acquisition on august  we have fully integrated westcon with our distribution and calibrations operations in order to operate as one entity 
this included merging westcon operations into transcat s laboratory network and financial systems 
as a result  we do not segregate the results of westcon from our organic business 
fiscal year net income includes a million reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we reversed the allowance after an evaluation of the status of our foreign tax credits and the likelihood that these credits would be utilized prior to their expiration 
fiscal year operating results included a million pre tax gain from the sale of transmation products group tpg  which had been deferred since fiscal net of income taxes  the impact of this previously deferred gain on fiscal year net income was approximately million 
net revenue for fiscal year was million  a increase compared with net revenue of million for fiscal year product segment sales increased to million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year of our product segment sales in fiscal year  were sold directly to end user customers while were to resellers compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year fiscal year product segment growth includes incremental sales associated with our acquisition of westcon and increased reseller sales to expand our market reach 
domestic sales comprised of the total product segment sales in fiscal year  while were to canada and were to other international markets 
service segment revenue increased to million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year of our service segment revenue in fiscal year  was generated by our calibration centers of excellence while was generated through subcontracted third party vendors  compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year gross margin for fiscal year was  a basis point decline compared with gross margin of in fiscal year product segment gross margin was in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year  while service segment gross margin improved to in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year operating expenses were million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year compared with million  or of total net revenue  in fiscal year operating income was million in fiscal year compared with million in fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  depreciable lives of fixed assets  estimated lives of our major catalogs and intangible assets  and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in 
table of contents reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to revenues over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of revenues and or the historical rate of returns 
inventory 
inventory consists of products purchased for resale and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventory is reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above cost by applying a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a quarterly basis 
property and equipment  depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed primarily under the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years machinery  equipment  and software furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements property and equipment determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we capitalize certain costs incurred in the procurement and development of computer software used for internal purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the fair market value measurement requirement  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach 
we test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
the evaluation of our reporting units on a fair value basis indicated that no impairment existed as of march  and march  catalog costs 
we capitalize the cost of each master catalog mailed and amortize the cost over the respective catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total unamortized catalog costs in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets were million as of march  and march  deferred taxes 
we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized based on an assessment of both positive and negative evidence 
see taxes below in this section and note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
stock based compensation 
we measure the cost of services received in exchange for all equity awards granted  including stock options  warrants and restricted stock  based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date 
we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards by recognizing  on a straight line basis  the unamortized grant date fair value over the remaining service period of each award 
excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock awards are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing 
table of contents activity 
excess tax benefits are realized benefits from tax deductions for exercised awards in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock based compensation costs for such awards 
we did not capitalize any stock based compensation costs as part of an asset 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience 
options generally vest over a period of up to four years and expire ten years from the date of grant 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  options granted to executive officers vest using a graded schedule of in the first year  in each of the second and third years  and in the fourth year 
prior options granted to executive officers vested equally over three years 
the expense relating to these executive officer options is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
during fiscal year  we granted performance based restricted stock awards in place of options as a primary component of executive compensation 
the performance based restricted stock awards vest after three years subject to certain cumulative diluted earnings per share growth targets over the eligible three year period 
during the second quarter of fiscal year and in conjunction with the acquisition of westcon  we modified these awards by increasing the cumulative diluted earnings per share growth performance condition 
the modification did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
compensation cost ultimately recognized for these performance based restricted awards will equal the grant date fair market value of the award that coincides with the actual outcome of the performance condition 
on an interim basis  we record compensation cost based on an assessment of the probability of achieving the performance condition 
at march   due to the economic conditions affecting our fiscal year financial performance  we estimated the probability of achievement for these performance based awards granted in fiscal year to be of the target level 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
product sales are recorded when a product s title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
we recognize the majority of our service revenue based upon when the calibration or other activity is performed and then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
we generally invoice our customers for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded based upon historical data 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements

we believe that the overall economic environment  specifically the conditions experienced in the second half of our fiscal year  negatively impacted our overall sales performance for the year 
this belief stems  in part  from the number of notices we have received from our suppliers and customers regarding plant shut downs  closures and workforce reductions 
in the first half of fiscal year  we experienced growth in product net sales compared with the first half of fiscal year  while in the second half of fiscal year  we grew only compared with the second half of fiscal year  including incremental sales from

our fiscal years and product sales in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales decline growth the fourth quarter of fiscal year was a week period compared to a week period in the fourth quarter of fiscal year product net sales per day increased in each quarter of fiscal year as compared with the same period of fiscal year  except for our fourth quarter of fiscal year we believe this was primarily due to a decline in the general economy 
our product sales per business day for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales per business day overall product sales from fiscal year to fiscal year reflect growth in our direct distribution channel 
the direct distribution channel experienced a growth in the first half of fiscal year  due primarily to a combination of increased prices  new product introductions by strategic suppliers  increased customer response to our sales and marketing efforts  and growing sales through our website 
direct distribution channel s sales in the third quarter of fiscal year were consistent with those in the third quarter of fiscal year  but experienced a decline from the fourth quarter of fiscal year to the fourth quarter of fiscal year we attribute this decline to the general weakness in the economy as demand from customers decreased despite aggressive pricing 
for fiscal year  our direct distribution channel gross profit percentage decreased basis points  primarily as a result of more competitive pricing in both our us and canadian markets 
while our direct distribution channel grew modestly in fiscal year  our reseller distribution channel increased  when compared to fiscal year we believe resellers continue to utilize us for our extensive availability to a broad range of new and existing products from within our inventory 
while sales increased significantly  our continued use of a volume based pricing structure allowed us to improve our reseller gross profit percentage by basis points in fiscal year when compared to the fiscal year the following table provides the percent of net sales and approximate gross profit percentage for significant product distribution channels fy fy percent of gross percent of gross net sales profit net sales profit direct reseller freight billed to customers total calculated at net sales less purchase costs divided by net sales 
customer product orders include orders for instruments that we routinely stock in our inventory  customized products  and other products ordered less frequently  which we do not stock 
pending product shipments are primarily backorders  but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our laboratories prior to shipment  orders required to be shipped complete  orders awaiting credit approval and orders required to be shipped at a future date 
our total pending product shipments at the end of fiscal year decreased by approximately million  or from the balance at the end of fiscal year we believe this decrease was a result of a decline in the general economy

within any year  while we add new customers  we also have customers from the prior year whose calibrations may not repeat for any number of factors 
among those factors are the variations in the timing of customer periodic calibrations on instruments and other services  customer capital expenditures and customer outsourcing decisions 
because of the timing of calibration orders and segment expenses can vary on a quarter to quarter basis  we believe a trailing twelve month trend provides a better indication of the progress of this segment 
our fiscal years and calibration service revenue in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons  were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q service revenue decline growth the fourth quarter of fiscal year was a week period compared to a week period in the fourth quarter of fiscal year within the calibration industry  there is a broad array of measurement disciplines making it costly and inefficient for any one provider to invest the needed capital for facilities  equipment and uniquely trained personnel necessary to address all measurement disciplines with in house calibration capabilities 
our strategy has been to focus our investments in the core electrical  temperature  pressure and dimensional disciplines 
accordingly  to of service segment revenue is generated from outsourcing customer equipment to third party vendors for calibration beyond our chosen scope of capabilities

these same factors led to a decline in product profit margin from in fiscal year to in fiscal year our product gross profit may be influenced by a number of factors that can impact quarterly comparisons 
among those factors are sales to our reseller channel which have lower margins than our direct customer base  periodic rebates on purchases  and cooperative advertising received from suppliers

our product sales per business day for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales per business day overall product sales from fiscal year to fiscal year reflect an growth in our direct distribution channel 
this growth was a result of a combination of increased prices  new product introductions by strategic suppliers  increased customer response to our sales and marketing efforts and growing sales through our website 
our direct distribution channel gross profit percentage increased points as a result of reduced discounting 
for the same time period  our reseller channel experienced a increase in gross profit despite a sales decrease of 
sales within this channel are driven by volume based pricing for each reseller 
during fiscal year  we adjusted our channel pricing structure  which generated a point increase in gross profit percentage for our resellers and a point decline in reseller sales as a percent of total product sales

we expect our product sales to have a relatively flat year with our fourth quarter being our strongest  whereas  our service revenue should strengthen as we move through the year 
revenues from both product sales and calibration services to the wind industry should be a greater part of revenues in fiscal year we have relationships with both the major wind turbine manufacturers and the major utilities that are building wind energy power and expect that this position will enable us to accelerate our growth within this industry over the next several years 
we believe we may also indirectly benefit from funds from the federal stimulus package that are dedicated to alternative energy

we monitor the relationship between the united states and canadian currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in canadian dollars as we believe to be appropriate 
we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not apply hedge accounting and therefore  the change in the fair value of the contracts  which totaled less than million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  was recognized as a component of other expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying receivables denominated in canadian dollars being hedged
