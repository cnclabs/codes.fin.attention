item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
overview consolidation and segments 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries  and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
we made one acquisition in and one acquisition in these entities results of operations for the periods from the acquisition dates through september  have been consolidated with our results  their operations prior to the dates of acquisition have not been included in the consolidated results for any period 
we currently operate in three industries light building products formerly referred to as building products  heavy construction materials formerly referred to as coal combustion products  or ccps and energy technology formerly referred to as energy 
in the light building products segment  we design  manufacture  and sell manufactured architectural stone  exterior siding accessories such as shutters  mounting blocks  and vents  concrete block and other building products 
revenues consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
we are a nationwide leader in the management and marketing of ccps  including fly ash used as a replacement for portland cement 
revenues in the heavy construction materials segment consist primarily of ccp product sales with a smaller amount of service revenue 
in the energy technology segment  we are focused on reducing waste and increasing the value of energy related feedstocks  primarily in the areas of low value coal and oil 
revenues for the energy technology segment through december  consisted primarily of sales of chemical reagents and license fees related to our former section k business 
beginning january   revenues for this segment consisted primarily of coal sales 
operations and strategy 
during the past several years  we have executed our two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from our existing operating business units and diversifying from significant reliance on the legacy energy technology segment section k business 
our historical acquisition strategy has targeted businesses that are leading companies in their respective industries and that have strong operating margins  thus providing additional cash flow that complements the financial performance of our existing businesses 
with the addition and expansion of our ccp management and marketing business through acquisitions beginning in  and the growth of our light building products business through several acquisitions beginning in  we have achieved revenue growth and diversification in three business segments 
in and subsequent years  we focused on the integration of our large acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse kinds of building products through our national distribution network 
in  we began to acquire small companies in the light building products industry with innovative products that could be marketed using our existing distribution channels 
during and  our primary focus has been on the development of our coal cleaning business and our primary use of cash consisted of maintenance and growth capital expenditures  a major portion of which related to our coal cleaning facilities in the energy technology segment 
in late and in  as the economy deteriorated  we focused on cost savings and strengthening our balance sheet 
we engaged in significant cost savings in our light building products segment by reducing advertising  employee and transportation expenses 
our continuous improvement initiative within our heavy construction materials segment has focused on reducing our cost structure through process improvements  headcount reductions  lower maintenance spending and improved terms on operating leases 
we consolidated management of our heavy construction materials business and our coal cleaning business to reduce overhead 
we also significantly reduced corporate and research and development spending 
at the same time  we sought to reduce indebtedness by convertible note exchanges for new convertible debt at reduced principal amounts and for common stock  and repaid million of our former senior secured debt from proceeds of the sale of common stock 

table of contents in october  we issued new senior secured notes aggregating approximately million  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repay all of our obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and virtually all of our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
also in october  we entered into a million asset based revolving loan facility abl revolver that is currently undrawn 
light building products segment 
the key strategic element of our building products strategy is to introduce new products into our extensive distribution system  providing us an outlet to rapidly increase geographic coverage for our products 
our light building products segment has been significantly affected by the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets 
accordingly  we are significantly reducing operating costs to be positively positioned to take advantage of a future industry turnaround  which we believe could begin in we continue to develop new building products and to leverage our robust distribution system which we believe is a competitive advantage for us 
there has been a severe slowing in through of new housing starts and in home sales generally 
bank foreclosures have put a large number of homes into the market for sale  effectively limiting some of the incentives to build new homes 
the homebuilding industry continues to experience a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale 
while our residential building products business relies upon the home improvement and remodeling markets as well as new construction  we experienced a further slowdown in sales activity in interest rate increases  limits on credit availability  further foreclosures  home price depreciation  and an oversupply of homes for sale in the market may adversely affect homeowners and or homebuilders ability or desire to engage in construction or remodeling  resulting in a continued or further slowdown in new construction or remodeling and repair activities 
we  like many others in the light building products industry  experienced a large drop in orders and a reduction in our margins in and relative to prior years 
in  and  we have recorded significant goodwill impairments associated with our light building products business 
none of the impairment charges in these years affected our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or debt covenant compliance 
we can provide no assurances that the light building products market will improve in the near future 
some recent industry reports suggest that the national home construction trend may be at or near the end of its decline 
however  we expect weakness to continue into the earlier part of and expect improved market conditions in the second half of based on current housing market forecasts showing the start of a housing recovery at such time 
the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the going concern threats to banks and other financial institutions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  including mortgages and home equity loans  and extreme volatility in credit and equity markets 
continued tightness of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements could adversely affect the availability of credit for purchasers of our products and thereby reduce our sales 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including the inability of prospective homebuyers or remodelers to obtain credit for financing the purchase of our building products 
these and other similar factors could cause decisions to delay or forego new home construction or improvement projects  cause our customers to delay or decide not to purchase our building products  or lead to a decline in customer transactions and our financial performance 
heavy construction materials segment 
our business strategy in the heavy construction materials industry is to negotiate long term contracts with suppliers  supported by investment in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
we are also continuing our efforts to expand the use of high value ccps  develop more uses for lower value ccps  and expand our ccp disposal services 
while all of our businesses have been affected by the current recession  the impact on our heavy construction materials segment has been less severe than on our other segments 
we anticipate that if the federal government expands its funding 
table of contents of roads  bridges  and other infrastructure projects as a part of its economic stimulus program  this should improve the demand for ccps in the future 
finally  a key element of our strategy is to increase our service revenue generated from ccp management 
energy technology segment 
we own and operate newly constructed and recently renovated coal cleaning facilities that remove impurities from waste and other low value coal  resulting in higher value  marketable coal 
construction of these facilities is now complete  but it was our largest single investment of cash during and capital expenditures in and were financed primarily with available cash from operations and lease financing 
capital expenditures in and future years are expected to be significantly lower than in and for  coal sales were million  compared to million for despite this growth in coal sales from to  there has been a rapid decline in demand and pricing for coal from to  especially metallurgical grade coal 
in addition  we have experienced high start up costs and operational challenges as we have finished construction and renovation activities and commenced operations at many facilities in a short period of time 
as of september   we have temporarily curtailed operations at four of our coal cleaning facilities and reduced staffing at other facilities to better match coal production with current demand 
the site lessor and feedstock coal supplier for one of these facilities located in kentucky has filed for bankruptcy 
the disruption caused by this bankruptcy and lack of primary coal supply may cause reduced or curtailed production at this facility for an extended period of time 
we are also committed to continuing to invest in research and development activities that are focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology  but at decreased levels in the future as compared to earlier periods 
we participate in joint ventures that operate an ethanol plant located in north dakota and a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea 
to a smaller degree  we are also investing in other energy projects such as the refining of heavy crude oils into lighter transportation fuels 
seasonality and weather 
both our light building products and our heavy construction materials segments are greatly impacted by seasonality 
revenues and ebitda are highest in the june and september quarters 
further  both segments are affected by weather as it impacts construction activities 
historical section k business 
a material amount of our consolidated revenue and net income through december  was derived from license fees and sales of chemical reagents  both of which were dependent on the ability of licensees and other customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuel that generated tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code 
we have also claimed section k tax credits for synthetic fuel sales from facilities in which we owned an interest 
the irs has challenged these credits in audit 
by law  section k tax credits for synthetic fuel produced from coal expired for synthetic fuel sold after december  with the expiration of section k at the end of calendar  our licensees synthetic fuel facilities and the facilities we owned were closed because production of synthetic fuel was not profitable absent the tax credits 
the closure of these synfuel facilities has had a negative effect on revenue  net income and cash flow comparing the periods prior to the closure with periods after the closure 
section k tax credits were subject to phase out after the average annual us wellhead oil price reference price exceeded a beginning phase out threshold price 
the calendar reference price reached the phase out range and the irs announced adjustments to the credits in calendar accordingly  in fiscal we adjusted previously recognized revenue and tax credits as required to reflect the finalized phase out 
the existence and unpredictability of phase out negatively affected the amount and timing of revenue recognition  net income and cash flow beginning in and continuing into we do not believe there are any material residual contingencies related to phase out 
debt and liquidity 
we incurred indebtedness in prior years to make strategic acquisitions  but were also able to increase cash flows and utilize that cash to reduce debt levels 
we became highly leveraged as a result of acquisitions  but reduced our outstanding debt significantly since that time through by using cash generated 
table of contents from operations  from underwritten public offerings of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
during through  we made several early repayments of our long term debt 
in and  early repayments of long term debt decreased as compared to earlier periods primarily due to our investments of available cash in the development of our coal cleaning business in the energy technology segment 
cash needs for capital expenditures continued in  so we were and continue to be highly focused on liquidity to enable us to continue implementing our overall operational strategy 
we lowered the aggregate amount of indebtedness under our convertible notes by million in by engaging in several exchanges of our convertible notes for common stock and new series of convertible notes bearing a higher interest rate 
we also sold common stock in a public offering in september and used net proceeds of approximately million to repay part of our former senior secured debt 
in october  we issued new senior secured notes aggregating approximately million  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of the proceeds to repay all of our remaining obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and virtually all of our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
also in october  we entered into a million abl revolver 
upon completion of these financings  we now have no debt maturities prior to  unless the holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes  totaling approximately million  exercise their put option in we currently have approximately million of cash on hand and additional liquidity is expected to be generated from operations over the next months 
in summary  our strategy for and subsequent years is to reduce capital expenditures to minimal levels  continue efforts to streamline operations and reduce operating and general overhead costs as much as possible  and to reduce our outstanding debt levels using cash on hand and cash flow from operations to the extent deemed prudent 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
these intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefit  over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the fair value of identified assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other originally issued as sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill  all of which relates to acquisitions 
asc topic requires us to periodically test for goodwill impairment  at least annually  or sooner if indicators of possible impairment arise 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as of june  using the two step process described in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as disclosed in note  through  we had five reporting units with allocated goodwill  three of which were in the light building products segment 
there was one reporting unit with goodwill in each of the heavy construction materials and energy technology segments 
as a result of changes in the operations and management of the businesses in the light building products segment  and in accordance with the requirements contained in asc topics and including the rules originally issued as eitf topic d  clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph of sfas no 
 commencing with our fiscal year we aggregated the three reporting units in the light building products segment into one reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing 
the changes in the light building products segment resulting in aggregation of the reporting units included  among other things  consolidation under a single management team  consolidation of incentive compensation programs to be dependent upon combined segment operating results  consolidation of some sales chains such that these chains sell many of the segment s products  and cross selling into other sales chains  collaboration on new products  and cash flow resource allocation decisions being made on a combined basis 
as a result of the depressed new housing and residential repair and remodeling markets  we determined that the light building products reporting unit s goodwill was impaired as of the june test dates in and  and non cash impairment charges of million and million  respectively  were recorded in those years 
due to the continuing decline in the new housing and residential repair and remodeling markets  the continued downward revisions by market analysts of near term projections in these markets  the collapse of the credit markets in and the significant decline in our stock price during the six months ended march   management determined that indicators of further goodwill impairment in the light building products reporting unit existed 
in addition  the significant declines in coal and oil prices and in our stock price indicated potential goodwill impairment in the energy technology reporting unit as well 
accordingly  we performed goodwill impairment tests for both the light building products and energy technology reporting units during the quarter ended march  upon completion of the impairment tests  we wrote off all remaining goodwill in the light building products and energy technology reporting units  totaling approximately million 
none of the impairment charges in  or affected our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or senior debt covenant compliance 
changes in the credit markets in late and in increased our borrowing rate  which borrowing rate directly affects the discount rate used in the goodwill impairment calculations 
this increase in the discount rate led to the majority of the goodwill impairment in the heavy construction materials reporting unit had recorded goodwill of approximately million as of september  and the goodwill impairment test was not failed for the heavy construction materials reporting unit for any test date  and accordingly  no impairment charges have been necessary for any period 
the estimated fair value of the heavy construction materials reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the june  test date by approximately million 
the anticipated future cash flows for this reporting unit are not currently expected to change significantly from levels 
in determining the fair values of the reporting units  all three of the traditional valuation approaches  the income approach  the market approach and the asset based approach  were considered 
the fair values of the reporting units were calculated using the income approach  determined by discounting expected future cash flows 
this method was chosen because it specifically considers the operations  opportunities and risks applicable to the reporting units 
the market approach  specifically the guideline public company method  was also considered 
however  the reporting units direct competitors are either subsets of large corporate entities or are privately held 
therefore  there is limited comparability between the reporting units and the potential guideline public companies 
accordingly  the guideline public company method was utilized only as a reasonableness test of the results from the income approach 
finally  the asset based approach was also considered  however  it was not utilized because it does not consider the income producing going concern nature of the reporting units assets 
as discussed above  the fair values of the reporting units are calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing these expected future cash 
table of contents flows  including most significantly the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows  anticipated long term growth rates  future profit margins  working capital requirements and required capital expenditures 
management uses its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of these and other inputs in the cash flow models utilized  however  it is certain that actual results will differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
materially different input estimates and assumptions would necessarily result in materially different calculations of discounted expected future cash flows and reporting unit fair values and materially different goodwill impairment estimates 
the most sensitive assumptions for the income approach were the discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital  the expected long term growth rate and expected future gross profit margins 
for the light building products reporting unit  discount rates of and were used in and  respectively 
each change in the discount rate would have changed the fair value of the reporting unit by approximately million in and million in the long term growth rate used was in both and each change in the long term growth rate would have changed the fair value by approximately million in and million in the expected future gross profit margins used ranged from in and in each change in the gross profit margins would have changed the fair value by approximately million in and million in the sensitivity to a change in these assumptions was much less pronounced in because of the high discount rate used  thereby lessening the impact of other variables on the fair value calculation 
our light building products segment gross margin percentage for the years through was   and  respectively 
the year over year revenue growth decrease was   and over the same period 
the results for and reflect the recent dramatic slowing of the light building products industry  however  we did not believe that recent conditions were indicative of the long term future of the housing market 
the housing market is extremely cyclical and the cycles can vary materially in length and scope 
average housing starts reported by the us national association of home builders nahb for the last seventeen years  including calendar  were million units per year 
while the estimated housing starts for calendar were million  the five year average that included current estimates for calendar and indicated estimated average housing starts of more than million units  which is nearly higher than the calendar actual starts 
we believe that the gross profit margins used in the cash flow forecast of in and in  which are consistent with our actual levels  were reasonable in the long term  especially given productivity improvements being implemented through application of lean manufacturing techniques 
we also believe that the long term revenue growth rate of will be achieved as the housing market rebounds 
in addition to the annual review  we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying value of all long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the estimated useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over the revised remaining useful lives  thereby prospectively adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
in connection with the goodwill impairment testing for the light building products and energy technology reporting units in  we also performed an analysis for potential impairments of other long lived assets in those reporting units  including all intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
the results of this analysis did not result in any significant impairment of any other long lived assets 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a decline in operating performance  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
no significant changes have been made to estimated useful lives during the periods presented 

table of contents it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that resulting write downs could be material 
income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments were required in the calculation of our income tax provisions for the years presented 
for example  one of the estimates affecting our tax provisions for and was the amount of section k tax credits that would ultimately be available related to our interest in an entity that owned and operated a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility  plus two other smaller alternative fuel facilities that we owned and operated see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the calendar phase out percentage was not finalized until the quarter ended june  as of september   we used our best estimate of what the phase out percentage for calendar would be  using available information as of that date 
an adjustment to reflect the final phase out percentages was reflected in as necessary 
the irs is currently auditing our tax credits claimed for synthetic fuel sold from the facilities in which we owned an interest 
the tax credits which are under audit that we believe are more likely than not to be sustained  and are therefore not included in unrecognized income tax benefits in the balance sheet  total approximately million 
in and  section refined coal tax credits which are different from the section k tax credits discussed above and elsewhere have been generated by coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that the refined coal produced at our coal cleaning facilities qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the irs will challenge section tax credits claimed by us 
in addition  congress may modify or repeal section so that these tax credits may not be available in the future 
from through  we have recognized a total benefit of approximately million related to section tax credits 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the impairment charge in was not deductible for tax purposes and most of the impairment charges in and were not tax deductible 
therefore  the goodwill impairment charges had a significant negative effect on our income tax provision for all of those years 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  approximately million of stock based compensation in resulted from the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards  requiring an acceleration of expense recognition for unrecognized compensation cost that remained as of the cancellation dates 
as a result of the cancellation of the stock based awards  approximately million of deferred tax assets were written off 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted the new rules for accounting for uncertain tax positions in asc topic income taxes originally issued as interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin effective as of october   the beginning of our fiscal year 
we made a cumulative adjustment to decrease retained earnings and increase income tax liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits by approximately million 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if released into income 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
for example  we are currently under audit by the irs for the years and and have open tax periods subject to examination by both federal and state taxing authorities for the years through we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities 
table of contents would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer probable or necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of our unrecognized income tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
these changes could be the result of our ongoing tax audits or the settlement of outstanding audit issues 
however  due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made  beyond amounts currently accrued 
in evaluating our ability to recover our recorded deferred tax assets  in full or in part  all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  is considered and evaluated 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 
stock based compensation 
we use the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation required by asc topic compensation stock compensation originally issued as sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of stock based awards for all awards expected to vest  over the period during which the related service is rendered by grantees 
the fair value of stock based awards is determined primarily using the black scholes merton option pricing model b s m model  developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of certain subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
for stock based awards  we primarily use the graded vesting or accelerated method to allocate compensation expense over the requisite service periods 
estimated forfeiture rates are based largely on historical data and ranged from to from through  depending on the type of award and the award recipients 
as of september   the estimated forfeiture rate for most unvested awards was per year 
the fair values of stock options and sars have been estimated using the b s m model  adjusted where necessary to account for specific terms of awards that the b s m model does not have the capability to consider  for example  sars which have a cap on allowed appreciation 
for these sars  the output determined by the b s m model has been reduced by an amount determined by a quasi monte carlo simulation to reflect the reduction in fair value associated with the appreciation cap 
the two most critical estimates in determining fair value are expected stock price volatility and expected lives 
expected stock price volatility was estimated using primarily historical volatilities of our common stock 
implied volatilities of traded options on our stock  volatility predicted by other models  and an analysis of volatilities used by other public companies in comparable lines of business were also considered 
in estimating expected lives  we considered the contractual and vesting terms of awards  along with historical experience  however  due to insufficient historical data from which to reliably estimate expected lives  we used estimates based on the simplified method set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletins no 
and  where expected life is estimated by summing the award s vesting term and contractual term and dividing that result by two 
insufficient historical data from which to reliably estimate expected lives is expected to exist for the foreseeable future due to different terms associated with awards granted in recent years  along with other factors 
risk free interest rates used were the us treasury bond yields with terms corresponding to the expected terms of the awards being valued 
as of september   there was approximately million of total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
due to the grant of stock based awards subsequent to september   the amount of total compensation cost related to nonvested awards has increased  and the weighted average period over which compensation cost will be recognized has changed 

table of contents stock based compensation expense was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
approximately million of the stock based compensation resulted from the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards  requiring an acceleration of expense recognition for unrecognized compensation cost that remained as of the cancellation dates 
the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards was a direct result of our low stock price as compared to the exercise prices of the cancelled sars 
litigation 
we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
historically  costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
during and  we incurred approximately million and million  respectively  of expense for legal matters  which consisted primarily of costs for outside legal counsel 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a total liability as of september  of million 
claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or our liability 
accordingly  management cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amount  if any  of our liability  nor is it possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the specific matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
license fee revenue recognition 
through december   we licensed our technologies to the owners of coal based solid alternative fuel facilities in the us license agreements contained a quarterly earned royalty fee generally set at a prescribed dollar amount per ton or a percentage of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
recurring license fees or royalty payments were recognized in the period when earned  which coincided with the sale of alternative fuel by our licensees  provided standard revenue recognition criteria such as amounts being fixed or determinable were met 
in most instances  we received timely reports from licensees notifying us of the amount of solid synthetic fuel sold and the royalty due us under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
additionally  we experienced a regular pattern of payment by these licensees of the reported amounts 
estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  could be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees with whom an established pattern existed 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee was beginning to produce and sell synthetic fuel or when a synthetic fuel facility was sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there was no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may have been more limited information available to estimate the license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  we used such information as was available and where possible  substantiated the information through such procedures as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by 
table of contents the licensee and used in the production of the solid synthetic fuel 
in certain limited situations  we were unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and revenue recognition was delayed until a future date when sufficient information was known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
the amount of license fee revenue recognized in and was affected by reduced revenues for certain licensees whose license agreements called for us to be paid a portion of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
certain accounting rules limit revenue recognition to amounts that are fixed or determinable and as a result of uncertainties related to phase out of section k tax credits and other licensee specific factors  the timing of revenue recognition was delayed for certain licensees during those years 
due to publication of the section k calendar reference price and the phase out range  finalization of calendar phase out was made possible during the quarter ended june  as a result of the availability of this information and the clarification of other licensee specific factors  certain calendar and prior year license fee revenue totaling approximately million was recognized in this amount related to periods ending on or prior to december  and was recognized in when it met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it was remote that any negative adjustment would be required in the future 
we applied the same policy in and with regard to the recognition of revenue for calendar tax credit based license fees 
the final determination of revenue pertaining to fiscal and calendar occurred in when the calendar reference price and phase out range were published and we adjusted previously recognized revenue and tax credits as required to reflect the finalized phase out 
the existence and unpredictability of phase out materially affected both the amount and timing of recognition of revenue  net income and cash flow in and at the current time  we do not believe there are any material residual contingencies related to phase out  however  we are involved in certain ongoing litigation related to our former section k business  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from million for gross profit decreased  from million in to million in our operating loss increased from million in to million in  and the net loss increased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the most significant reason for the change in results from to was an increase in the goodwill impairment charge to million in  compared to million in in addition to the goodwill impairment charges in both years  our section k business terminated in excluding our section k business for  total revenue for was down  from million for  and gross profit was down  from million in excluding our section k business and the goodwill impairment charges for both and  operating income decreased from million in to an operating loss of million in  and net income decreased from million with diluted earnings per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in our sales of light building products in was due primarily to the continuing effects of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets which impacted sales across most of our product lines 
also  in early  we sold certain non strategic mortar stucco assets in this segment which accounted for approximately million of the decrease in revenue from to the gross margin percentage declined from to due primarily to fewer fixed costs being absorbed as a result of lower sales 
we believe our niche strategy and our focus in on productivity 
table of contents improvements and cost reductions tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in new residential construction  however  the recession has resulted in higher unemployment  adding to the high level of home foreclosures  putting additional homes on the market and further reducing the demand for new construction 
new housing starts according to the national association of home builders were million and million units in calendar and  respectively  compared to a year average of million units 
our light building products business relies on the home improvement and remodeling markets as well as new construction 
the us census bureau s value of private residential construction spending put in place data as revised on homeowner improvement activity shows that the four quarter moving average peaked at billion in the second quarter of calendar and fell to approximately billion by the second quarter of calendar the leading indicator of remodeling activity estimate issued by the joint center for housing studies at harvard university has estimated that the four quarter moving average will be only billion in the fourth quarter of calendar  which would be the lowest level since the first quarter of calendar given our market leadership positions and reduced cost structure  we believe that we are positioned to benefit from a rebound in the housing market when it occurs 
we believe the residential housing market is in the early stages of a broad recovery and that the long term growth prospects in the industry are strong 
according to the us census bureau  seasonally adjusted annualized housing starts in august were up from their lows experienced earlier in the year  but current seasonally adjusted annualized housing starts are still well below the year average 
according to the harvard joint center for housing studies  the nation s housing stock will have to accommodate approximately million to million additional households due to population growth over the next decade 
heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in heavy construction materials revenues in compared to was due primarily to significant reductions in concrete consumption  partially offset by increased revenue from service contracts 
the gross margin percentage increased from to primarily due to declines in the costs of rail and truck transportation and improved productivity 
energy technology segment 
in  our energy technology segment revenue consisted primarily of residual revenues related to our section k business 
in  there was no section k revenue and energy technology segment revenue consisted almost exclusively of coal sales related to our coal cleaning business 
cost of revenue exceeded revenue for this segment in due primarily to low coal prices and ongoing start up and ramp up costs for newly constructed and renovated coal cleaning facilities that were placed in service in late and in the quarter ended december  as of september   we have temporarily idled four of our coal cleaning facilities to align production to sales and to concentrate production in fewer facilities 
we have also reduced staffing at other facilities and cut costs at all locations to reduce the breakeven point for the coal cleaning business 
the site lessor and feedstock coal supplier for one of the idled facilities located in kentucky has filed for bankruptcy 
the disruption caused by this bankruptcy and lack of primary coal supply may cause reduced or curtailed production at this facility for an extended period of time 
operating expenses 
the increase in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets and amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in a late acquisition 
research and development expense decreased by million from to  primarily because of decreased spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in was due to reduced expenses in every significant category of expense except for professional services 
the largest contributor of cost savings was personnel related costs  including incentive pay  totaling million 
incentive pay decreased due to reduced profitability of our operations  and other personnel related costs decreased primarily because of headcount reductions 
professional services increased by approximately million in due to significant litigation costs  which increased million from due to implemented and planned cost cutting activities  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for to be below comparable levels 

table of contents other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million during the change in other income and expense of million was comprised of an increase in net interest expense of approximately million  combined with an increase in net other income of approximately million 
net interest expense increased from million in to million in due to several factors  most notably increased interest expense attributed to our convertible debt exchanges that occurred in that resulted in the extinguishment of million of and convertible notes and the issuance of million of and convertible notes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these convertible debt exchanges  approximately million of accelerated debt issue costs were amortized related to the extinguished convertible notes 
in addition  we experienced higher interest rates on our senior debt as a result of two amendments to our former senior secured credit agreement and increased interest expense from higher utilization of our revolving credit facility in due to the increased interest rates on our convertible debt  the october issuance of new high rate senior secured notes  and the implementation of new accounting rules for convertible debt see note to the consolidated financial statements  we expect interest expense for to significantly exceed the level for the increase in net other income of million consisted primarily of a million net gain related to the exchanges of convertible debt for both new convertible debt gain of million and common stock loss of million  substantially offset by a decrease of million in gain on sale of property  plant and equipment in as compared to in  we sold certain non strategic mortar stucco assets in the light building products segment on which a gain of approximately million was recognized 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to acquire assets that have increased the capacity of our texas based concrete block business  which contributed to higher operating income of this business in income tax provision 
we recorded income taxes with an effective tax rate of less than in exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  most of which was not tax deductible and approximately in exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  most of which was not tax deductible 
the effective tax rates disregarding goodwill impairment differ from the statutory rate primarily due to section tax credits 
the section refined coal tax credits which are different from the section k tax credits discussed elsewhere have been generated by coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that the refined coal produced at the coal cleaning facilities qualify for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of the tax credits and goodwill impairment charges in both years  our effective tax rate for and would have been approximately and  respectively 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from billion for gross profit decreased  from million in to million in operating income decreased from million in to an operating loss of million in net income decreased from million  with diluted earnings per share of  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in excluding our section k business and the goodwill impairment charges for both and  total revenue in was million  down from million in  gross profit was million in  down from million in  and operating income decreased from million to million in net income in was million with diluted earnings per share of  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in 
table of contents revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below 
light building products segment

heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the increase in heavy construction materials revenues in was due primarily to more ash disposal contracts in compared to the gross margin percentage decreased from to primarily due to geographic and product mix changes 
energy technology segment 
in  our energy technology segment revenue consisted almost exclusively of chemical reagent sales  license fee revenue related to our solid alternative fuel technologies and sales of synthetic fuel  all of which related to our section k business 
in  approximately of our energy technology segment revenue consisted of section k revenue  the substantial majority of which was recognized in the quarter ended december   when our section k business terminated 
coal sales revenue was million in  compared to million in other energy technology segment revenues were million in operating expenses 
the decrease in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to intangible assets that have been fully amortized 
research and development expense decreased by million from to primarily because of decreased spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in was due primarily to reduced incentive pay expenses and stock based compensation  partially offset by increased spending in our energy technology segment on coal cleaning growth initiatives 
incentive pay decreased due to reduced profitability of our operations and stock based compensation decreased primarily due to approximately million of accelerated expense related to the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards in other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the decrease in net other expense of million was comprised of a decrease in net interest expense of approximately million and a net change in other income expense items of approximately million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to lower variable interest rates and lower average levels of long term debt in as compared to the change in other income expense items of million consisted primarily of a million decrease in costs related to our investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements  plus million of gain on the sale of property  plant and equipment in compared to a loss of million in the majority of the property  plant and equipment sold in represented non strategic assets in our light building products segment 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to acquire assets that increased the capacity of our texas based concrete block business 
income tax provision 
we recorded income tax provisions with an effective tax rate of approximately in  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  which was not tax deductible and less than 
table of contents in  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  most of which was not tax deductible 
the effective tax rate for disregarding the goodwill impairment charge was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to section k tax credits related to the two coal based solid alternative fuel facilities that we owned and operated  plus our interest in an entity that owned and operated another alternative fuel facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december  qualified for tax credits pursuant to section k of the internal revenue code 
the effective tax rate for disregarding the goodwill impairment charge was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to section refined coal tax credits 
excluding the effect of the tax credits and goodwill impairment charges in both years  our effective tax rate for and would have been approximately and  respectively 
impact of inflation and related matters in certain periods  some of our operations have been negatively impacted by increased raw materials costs for commodities  such as polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride in the light building products segment  however  the negative impact has generally been less significant during than during we have been successful in passing on some  but not all  increased materials costs to customers 
additionally  recent decreases in fuel costs have benefited all of our business units during it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of these costs  nor our ability to pass on any future price increases to customers 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million  compared to million for the net loss would have been approximately million instead of million if adjusted for goodwill impairment and the decrease in deferred taxes  nearly all of which related to the goodwill impairment 
after adjusting for the effects of goodwill impairment in both and  profitability decreased in compared to primarily due to the effects on our light building products business of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets  losses sustained by our coal cleaning business  and the absence of section k related operations in the termination of our section k business was also one of the reasons for the higher cash flow from collection of trade receivables in than and was the cause of some of the other changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected in the operating activities section of the statements of cash flows 
in both and  our primary investing activities consisted of the purchase of property  plant and equipment and payments for acquisitions 
in  our primary financing activities consisted of borrowings under our revolving credit arrangement and the purchase of treasury stock 
in  in addition to borrowings under the revolving credit arrangement  our financing activities consisted primarily of several non cash convertible debt exchanges for both new convertible debt and common stock  and the issuance of common stock  the net proceeds of which were used to repay long term debt 
more details about our investing and financing activities  including the significant transactions that occurred subsequent to september   are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
total expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were million  a decrease of million from in  the majority of capital expenditures were for projects in the energy technology and light building products segments 
the energy technology segment expenditures were for the construction and renovation of coal cleaning facilities and the light building products segment expenditures were for both expansion of operations primarily our texas block business and maintenance of operating capacity 
in  the majority of capital expenditures were for coal cleaning facilities and expansion of operations in the heavy construction materials segment 
spending on coal cleaning facilities will comprise a much smaller portion of total expenditures in future years as compared to and total capital expenditures are currently expected to be approximately million 

table of contents capital expenditures are limited by the terms of our new abl revolver to million in  million in and million in as of september   we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
in  we realized million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  most of which represented non strategic assets in our light building products segment 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale was used to acquire assets that increased the capacity of our texas based concrete block business  enabling us to meet current and projected demand in this line of business 
in  proceeds from disposition of property  plant and equipment of million were closer to normal historical levels 
in  we acquired of the ownership interests of dutch quality stone dqs  a privately held company in the light building products business 
total consideration paid at the date of acquisition was approximately million 
an additional million was paid in  based on earnings of dqs for the month period ended september  that exceeded an agreed upon threshold 
in  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately held company in the light building products industry 
total consideration for this acquisition was approximately million  of which approximately million was paid at the date of acquisition and approximately million was paid in  with approximately million of assumed liabilities 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations and commercialization of technologies currently being developed 
acquisitions have historically been an important part of our long term business strategy  however  primarily because of debt covenant restrictions  but also due to cash flow considerations and current events affecting the debt and equity markets  we do not currently anticipate any significant acquisitions in the foreseeable future 
we have also invested in several joint ventures  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  but we do not currently have plans to significantly increase our investments in those entities 
our new debt agreements significantly limit potential acquisitions and investments in joint ventures  with the abl revolver being the most restrictive 
during the four year term of the abl revolver  our acquisitions and investments in joint ventures and other less than owned entities are limited to a cumulative total of million 
financing activities 
in  our primary financing activities consisted of i the non cash exchange of million of convertible senior subordinated notes for million of new convertible senior subordinated notes  ii the non cash exchange of approximately million of convertible senior subordinated notes for approximately million shares of common stock  iii the issuance of million shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of approximately million  iv the repayment of long term debt  and v borrowings under our revolving credit arrangement 
in addition  in october  we issued new senior secured notes aggregating approximately million  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of the proceeds to repay all of our obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and virtually all of the outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
also in october  we entered into a million abl revolver 
in  we exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due for million of new convertible senior subordinated notes due  and exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due for approximately million of new convertible senior subordinated notes due gains of approximately million  recorded in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for  were recognized on the extinguishments of debt 
additionally  approximately million of unamortized debt issue costs related to the extinguished debt was charged to interest expense 
new debt issue costs of approximately million were incurred related to the new and convertible notes 
in  we also exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes plus related accrued interest for approximately million shares of common stock and we exchanged approximately million of our convertible senior subordinated notes plus accrued interest for 
table of contents approximately million shares of common stock 
in accordance with the provisions of asc topic debt originally issued as sfas no 
 induced conversions of convertible debt  we recorded a non cash expense of approximately million in connection with these transactions  which amount represents the fair value of the shares issued in excess of the shares required to be issued pursuant to the original terms of conversion described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also in  we issued million shares of common stock for gross cash proceeds of approximately million 
after deducting offering costs totaling approximately million  the net cash proceeds of million were used to pay down our senior secured term debt 
in both and  we had borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit arrangement  primarily related to seasonal financing needs and energy technology segment capital expenditures 
as of september   we had million outstanding under this arrangement  all of which was repaid with proceeds from the new senior secured debt issued in october in  financing activities also included treasury stock purchases totaling million 
in october  we issued new senior secured notes aggregating approximately million  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of the proceeds to repay all of our obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and virtually all of the outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
because the amount outstanding under the revolving credit arrangement as of september  was repaid with those proceeds  we classified it as long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
also in october  we entered into a million abl revolver 
significant terms of our former senior secured credit facility and all of our convertible senior subordinated notes  as well as the new senior secured notes and the abl revolver are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
availability under the abl revolver can not exceed million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
availability under the abl revolver is further limited by the borrowing base valuations of certain assets of our light building products and heavy construction materials segments  consisting of trade receivables and inventories  which secure the borrowings 
in addition to the first lien position on these assets  the abl revolver lenders have a second priority position on substantially all other assets 
the abl revolver matures in october  at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid and the lending commitment terminates 
following the october issuance of the new senior secured notes and the repayments of outstanding debt with most of those proceeds  there are currently no maturities of debt prior to  unless the holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes exercise their put option in following certain asset sales  as defined  we could be required to prepay a portion of the new outstanding notes 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants  as amended  as of september  and as of the october termination date of the former senior secured credit facility 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants of the new senior secured notes and the abl revolver 
the senior secured notes and abl revolver limit the incurrence of additional debt and liens on assets  prepayment of subordinated debt  merging or consolidating with another company  selling assets  making capital expenditures  making acquisitions and investments and the payment of dividends or distributions  among other things 
in addition  if in the future the availability under the abl revolver is less than a specified percentage  we will be required at that time to maintain a monthly fixed charge coverage ratio of at least i x for the last twelve month period for each month ending on or prior to december   and ii x for the last twelve month period for each month ending after december  currently  we do not meet that minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x  but at the present time and for the foreseeable future  there is no requirement to comply with that ratio 
we filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement for the potential sale of a total of million of debt or equity securities 
this registration statement was declared effective in april following 
table of contents the issuance of common stock described above  approximately million remains available for future offerings of securities under the registration statement 
a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering could commence under the registration statement 
in both and  cash proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchases were not material 
option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  we receive an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts were not material in either or working capital 
as of september   our working capital was million  compared to million as of september  notwithstanding the continuing decrease in light building products and heavy construction materials revenues as a result of existing economic conditions  we currently expect operations to produce positive cash flow in and in future years 
in addition  following the october transactions described above  our working capital has increased by more than million subsequent to september  we believe this level of working capital will be sufficient for operating needs for the next months  and currently believe that it will not be necessary to utilize borrowing capacity under the abl revolver for our seasonal cash needs or otherwise in income taxes 
historically  there has often been a lag in paying estimated taxes during a fiscal year due to the seasonality of our operations and because estimated income tax payments are typically based on annualizing a fiscal year s taxable income based on year to date results 
we currently expect this pattern to continue  but to have a less significant effect on our cash flow in future periods due to expected results of operations that are closer to break even than what we have historically experienced 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate in future years to be different from the statutory rate primarily due to the availability of section refined coal tax credits 
these tax credits relate to the coal cleaning facilities that we currently own and operate 
the tax credits are expected to reduce required cash payments for estimated taxes during the year they are earned 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits and we have recorded approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits which would affect the effective tax rate if released into income 
during  we released approximately million of liabilities for interest and penalties and as of september   approximately million was accrued for the payment of interest and penalties 
changes to the estimated liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during were primarily the result of settlement of the irs audit for the years and the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
for example  we are currently under audit by the irs for the years and and have open tax periods subject to examination by both federal and state taxing authorities for the years through we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer probable or necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of our unrecognized income tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
these changes could be the result of our ongoing tax audits or the settlement of outstanding audit issues 
however  due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made  beyond amounts currently accrued 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and from the exercise of non qualified stock options  which 
table of contents amounts were not material in or option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price which is not predictable  and likewise  it is not possible to estimate what tax benefits may be realized from future option exercises 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant cash requirements for  beyond seasonal operational working capital requirements  consist primarily of interest payments on long term debt and capital expenditures 
in years beyond  significant cash requirements will also include the repayment of debt  but not prior to june  when the convertible senior subordinated notes can be put to us 
debt covenant compliance and ebitda 
during  we experienced potential debt covenant compliance risk related to certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios associated with our former senior secured credit facility 
the potential risk was primarily the result of declining ebitda combined with increased levels of capital expenditures 
ebitda is defined as net income loss plus net interest expense  income taxes as defined  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  foreign currency translation gain or loss and goodwill and other impairments 
the three primary debt covenant ratios with which we were required to comply under our former senior secured credit facility were i a maximum total leverage ratio of as of september   ii a maximum ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness minus subordinated indebtedness to ebitda  or senior leverage ratio  of as of september   and iii a minimum ratio of ebitda plus rent payments ebitdar  less certain capital expenditures and taxes for the four preceding fiscal quarters  to scheduled rent payments and payments of principal and interest on all indebtedness for the next four fiscal quarters  or fixed charge coverage ratio  of as of september  in connection with the amendment to the credit facility which was in effect as of september   the lenders agreed to waive the total leverage ratio requirement 
the following table summarizes the calculations of each of these three key ratios for the dates indicated 
in millions september  september  september  senior debt  including revolver a convertible debt b total long term debt  including current portion stand by letters of credit other long term obligations total indebtedness  as defined c ttm ebitda  as defined d total leverage ratio c d senior leverage ratio c b d ttm ebitda rent expense less certain capital expenditures income taxes ttm ebitdar  as defined e future twelve months scheduled interest payments future twelve months scheduled repayments of long term debt and other obligations future twelve months scheduled rent payments future fixed charges  as defined f fixed charge coverage ratio e f 
table of contents trailing twelve months ttm ebitda as used in the above table is calculated as follows  along with ebitda by segment in thousands september  september  september  net income loss net interest expense income taxes  as defined depreciation and amortization  as defined impairments  as defined inducement loss on debt to equity exchange ttm ebitda  as defined d light building products segment heavy construction materials segment energy technology segment corporate ttm ebitda  all segments ebitda  in addition to being used to monitor compliance with debt covenants  is also used by management to measure operating performance  as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ebitda is also used by investors to measure a company s ability to service its debt and meet its other cash needs 
the ebitda calculation as reflected in the preceding table is consistent with the definitions of such items in our former senior secured credit facility and with the definitions management intends on using in future periods when measuring operating performance  but differs in certain respects with the definitions in our new october debt agreements 
management believes ebitda is helpful in highlighting trends  because ebitda excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long term strategic decisions regarding capital structure  the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments 
management compensates for the limitations of using non gaap financial measures by using them to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than gaap results alone 
ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity 
additionally  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
our presentation of ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because the definitions of ebitda vary among companies and industries  it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
legal matters we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for legal costs and for other information about legal matters 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases for certain facilities and equipment  but otherwise do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by fiscal year in millions total after senior secured debt convertible senior subordinated notes total long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations capital expenditures other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations future maturities of long term debt as of september  are shown in the table above using debt that existed as of that date and considering the related contractually required repayment dates 
as noted previously  all of the senior secured debt and virtually all of the convertible senior subordinated notes were repaid in october with most of the net proceeds from the issuance of million of new senior secured notes 
accordingly  the total amount of our contractual obligations and the timing of payment for our debt service obligations have changed significantly 
substituting the newly issued senior secured notes and related interest obligations for the extinguished former senior secured debt and convertible debt would increase the total obligations in the above table to approximately million 
the holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes due june  totaling million  have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on june  if all of the holders of those notes required us to repurchase the notes in june instead of june  the timing of payment of million of debt obligations  along with the amount and timing of the related interest payments would be different 
future interest payments on our variable rate former senior secured debt as shown in the table above were calculated based on the actual interest rate in effect as of september  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our new abl revolver provides for potential borrowings of up to million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made beyond amounts currently accrued  nor can we reliably estimate the timing of any potential payments 
reference is made to the caption compensation arrangements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of potential commitments to certain officers and employees under employment agreements  long term incentive cash bonus awards  executive change in control agreements  and performance unit awards 
amounts in addition to those included in the table above could become obligations under the terms of those agreements  depending upon the future events described in note we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 

table of contents historically  costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
during and  we incurred approximately million and million  respectively  of expense for legal matters  which consisted primarily of costs for outside legal counsel 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a total liability as of september  of million 
claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or liability to us 
accordingly  management cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amount  if any  of our liability  nor is it possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the specific matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
recent accounting pronouncements reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been recently issued which we have not yet adopted 
in particular  the new rules related to accounting for our convertible debt must be applied retrospectively to all periods subsequent to january item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to certain foreign currencies and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have entered into certain hedge transactions in the past  primarily to limit variable interest rate exposure  but there are no such hedges outstanding as of september  the blue flint joint venture has derivatives in place related to variable interest rates and commodities 
we have limited operations in foreign jurisdictions 
however  one of our joint ventures with evonik industries ag owns a hydrogen peroxide business located in south korea 
this joint venture has million approximately million at september  of long term debt along with other obligations denominated in euros
