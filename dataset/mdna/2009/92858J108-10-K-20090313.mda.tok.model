item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors in item a 
overview we are a leading provider of on demand software for public relations management 
our web based software suite helps organizations of all sizes fundamentally change the way they communicate with both the media and the public  optimizing their public relations and increasing their ability to measure its impact 
our on demand software addresses the critical functions of public relations including media relations  news distribution and news monitoring 
we deliver our solutions over the internet using a secure  scalable application and system architecture  which allows our customers to eliminate expensive up front hardware and software costs and to quickly deploy and adopt our on demand software 
we sell access to our on demand software primarily through our direct sales channel 
as of december   we had  active subscription customers from a variety of industries  including financial and insurance  technology  healthcare and pharmaceutical and retail and consumer products  as well as government agencies  not for profit organizations and educational institutions 
we define active subscription customers as unique customer accounts that have an active subscription and have not been suspended for non payment 
additionally  we are a provider of online distribution of press releases 
we enable our customers to achieve visibility on the internet by distributing search engine optimized press releases directly to various news sites and the public 
we offer an on demand solution which allows our customers to widely distribute press releases containing important elements of content rich media such as images  podcasts and video messages to drive internet traffic to websites and increase brand awareness 
we plan to continue the expansion of our customer base by expanding our direct distribution channels  expanding our international market penetration and selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions 
as a result  we plan to hire additional personnel  particularly in sales and marketing  expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities and develop our operational and financial systems to manage a growing business 
we also intend to identify and acquire companies which would either expand our solution s functionality  provide access to new customers or markets  or both 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from subscription agreements and related services and from the online distribution of press releases 
our subscription agreements contain multiple service elements and deliverables  which include use of our on demand software  hosting services  content and content updates  implementation and training services and customer support 
the typical term of our subscription agreements is one year  however  our customers may purchase subscriptions with multi year terms 
we invoice our customers in advance of their annual subscription  with payment terms that require our customers pay us within days of invoice 
our subscription agreements are non cancelable  though customers typically have the right to terminate their agreements for cause if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement 
additionally  we derive revenue on a per transaction basis from the online distribution of press releases 
we generally receive payment in advance of the distribution of the press release 
professional services revenue consists primarily of data migration  training and configuration services sold separately after the initial subscription agreement 
typically  our professional service engagements are billed on a fixed fee basis with payment terms requiring our customers to pay us within days of invoice 
revenues from professional services sold separately from subscription agreements have not been material to our business accounting for less than of our revenues 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of compensation for training  editorial and support personnel  hosting infrastructure including depreciation associated with computer equipment and software  fees and expenses to distribute press releases  acquisition  maintenance and amortization of content  amortization of purchased technology  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and allocated overhead 
we allocate overhead expenses such as employee benefits  computer and office supplies  management information systems and depreciation for computer equipment based on headcount 
as a result  indirect overhead expenses are included in cost of revenues and each operating expense category 
we believe content is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to broad  current and relevant information critical to their public relations efforts 
in september  we expanded our proprietary database when we launched our united kingdom and ireland media database 
we expect to continue to make investments in both our own content as well as content acquired from third parties and to continue to enhance our news monitoring service and our proprietary information database 
we expect that in  cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars but will decrease as a percentage of revenues  as we incur expenses to expand our content offerings and our capacity to support new customers 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses are our largest operating expense  accounting for of our revenues 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions and incentives  marketing programs  including lead generation  events and other brand building expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time we invoice a customer under their subscription agreement  and we recognize substantially all of our revenues ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
as our revenues increase  we plan to invest in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales and marketing personnel to add new customers  increase sales to our existing customers and increase sales of our online press release distribution services 
we also plan to expand our marketing activities in order to build brand awareness and generate additional leads for our growing sales personnel 
we expect that in  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our software application development personnel and allocated overhead 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand software 
because of our hosted  on demand model  we are able to provide all of our customers with a single  shared version of our application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain legacy versions of our software  which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software business models 
we expect that in  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies  but will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting and administrative personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will decrease as a percentage of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortized intangible assets consist of customer relationships  agreements not to compete and a trade name acquired in business combinations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
our subscription agreements generally contain multiple service elements and deliverables 
these elements include access to our software and often specify initial services including implementation and training 
our subscription agreements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time 
our revenue recognition policy considers all elements in our multiple element subscription agreements as a single unit of accounting  and accordingly  we recognize all associated fees over the subscription period  which is typically one year 
we recognize our revenue over the subscription period because the access to our software is the last element delivered to the customer and the predominant element of our agreements 
in applying the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  we determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription to our on demand software after delivery of specified initial services 
when we sell this subscription separately from professional services the price charged varies and  therefore  we cannot objectively and reliably determine the subscription s fair value 
as a result  subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
professional services sold separately from a subscription arrangement are recognized as the services are performed 
we distribute press releases over the internet which are indexed by major search engines and distributed directly to various news sites  journalists and other key constituents 
we recognize revenue on a per transaction basis when the press releases are made available to the public 
sales commissions 
sales commissions are expensed when we invoice a customer under their subscription agreement 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires stock based compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award 
we recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on the estimated portion of the awards that are expected to vest 
we apply estimated forfeiture rates based on analyses of historical data  including termination patterns and other factors 
we use the quoted closing market price of our common stock on the grant date to measure the fair value of our restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our option awards 
we became a public entity in december  and therefore have a limited history of volatility 
accordingly  the expected volatility is based primarily on the historical volatilities of similar entities common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the awards 
the expected term of an award is based on the simplified method allowed by staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
whereby the expected term is equal to the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate on us treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards 
we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  use an expected dividend yield of zero 
business combinations 
we have completed acquisitions of businesses that have resulted in the recording of goodwill and identifiable definite lived intangible assets based on the estimated fair value of those assets 
definite lived intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships  a trade name  agreements not to compete and purchased technology 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized either on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
accounting for these acquisitions requires us to make determinations about the fair value of assets acquired  useful lives for definte lived intangible assets  and liabilities assumed that involve estimates and judgments 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is assessed for impairment at least annually 
goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount  then goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
we perform our annual impairment assessment on november  however  we could be required to evaluate goodwill impairment prior to the required annual assessment if indicators of impairment exist 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flow estimates required various judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates 
assumptions about sales  operating margins and growth rates are based on our budgets  business plans and economic projections 
we compared the estimated fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  and as such  no potential goodwill impairment was noted 
we assess the impairment of definite lived intangible and other long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be fully recoverable 
we determine the impairment  if any  by comparing the carrying value of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
impairment charges for long lived assets for the years ended december   and were not material 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by the valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our judgments relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdictions and various state and foreign jurisdictions and are subject to us federal tax  state and foreign tax examinations for years ranging from to our judgments relative to the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities take into account estimates of the amount of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
historically  we have maintained a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets because we were unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we would realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
based on recent operating results and our current projections of future taxable income  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will have future taxable income sufficient to realize certain of our deferred tax assets 
during  we reversed million of our valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
at december   we maintained a full valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound sterling 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of currencies against the us dollar 
revenues from subscription agreements denominated in a foreign currency were approximately  and of our total revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
exchange rate fluctuations have not significantly impacted our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
historically  we have not utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure  however  we may choose to use such contracts in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of money market funds  corporate notes and bonds  government sponsored agency securities and other debt securities 
our interest income is subject to interest rate risk 
for the year ended december  a fluctuation in interest rates of percentage point would change interest income by approximately
