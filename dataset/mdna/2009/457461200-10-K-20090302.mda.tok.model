all dollar amounts in this section are presented in thousands  except per share data and square footage data 
this section provides the following an executive summary and our strategies and objectives  the critical accounting policies that impact the treatment  for financial statement purposes  of certain items such as how we value our investment properties  recognize rental income and depreciate our assets  a discussion of our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows and how the changes in balance sheet and cash flow items from year to year impact our liquidity and capital resources  and a discussion of our results of operations  including changes in funds from operations ffo from year to year and a discussion of the impact that inflation may have on our results 
we have qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ended december  so long as we qualify for treatment as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet the requirements of the tests imposed by the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income  property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
to maintain our qualification as a reit  we engage in certain activities through inland venture corporation ivc  a wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary trs 
as such  we are subject to federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities 
we had no unrecognized tax benefits as defined by fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as of december  we expect no significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits due to changes in tax positions within one year of december  we have no interest or penalties relating to income taxes recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income for the years ended december   and or in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and as of december   returns for the calendar years through remained subject to examination by us and various state and local tax jurisdictions 
executive summary we are an owner operator of neighborhood  community  power  lifestyle and single tenant retail centers 
we are a self administered reit incorporated under maryland law 
we also may construct or develop properties or render services in connection with such development or construction 
through our trs  we also manage properties owned by ventures in which we may or may not be a partner 
as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including those owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
properties under development are not included as investment properties until they reach a stabilized occupancy rate 
income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources include  but are not limited to  amounts raised from the sale of securities under our dividend reinvestment plan  draws on our line of credit facility  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders 
one of our main goals is to continue increasing our revenues by acquiring additional investment properties and re leasing those spaces that are vacant  or may become vacant  at existing properties  at more favorable rental rates 
during the year ended december   we executed new  renewal and seven non comparable leases new  previously unleased space  aggregating approximately  square feet on our consolidated portfolio 
the new leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a increase over the average expir ing rate 
the renewal leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  an increase over the average expiring rate 
the seven non comparable leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average base rent of 
during  there are leases expiring in our consolidated portfolio  which comprise approximately  square feet and account for approximately of our annualized base rent 
we will attempt to renew or re lease these spaces at more favorable rental rates to increase revenues and cash flow 
however  future rental rate increases will most likely be lower than expected in light of the current economic conditions 
we seek to acquire properties with high quality tenants and attempt to mitigate our risk of tenant defaults by maintaining a diversified tenant base 
we focus our efforts on necessity based retail centers which we believe will provide us with relatively stable earnings and potentially growth opportunities in the future 
retailers generally have experienced declining sales over the past several months 
according to analysts  the outlook for the coming months is that retail sales will continue to decline 
those retailers impacted the greatest appear to be are those where people would spend discretionary income  such as furniture  electronics and clothing stores 
these declining sales represent a wide range of consumer concerns  even for high income households 
on the other hand  it appears that those retailers focused on necessity based items  such as grocers and discount stores  continue to maintain their sales 
the effect of the current economic downturn is having an impact on many retailers in our portfolio 
there have been many national retail chains that have filed for bankruptcy  such as wickes furniture  linens n things and circuit city that have had a negative impact on our portfolio 
analysts expect that more retailers will file for bankruptcy in in addition to those who have filed  or may file  bankruptcy  many retailers have announced store closings and a slow down in their expansion plans 
in  wickes furniture  a tenant at five of our investment properties filed for bankruptcy and has since liquidated 
two of these locations are at investment properties owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
all leases were rejected and the stores have closed 
wickes furniture represented approximately one percent of our annual base rent 
we have been able to re lease four of the five vacated stores within a short period of time 
with the four new leases  we have replaced nearly all of the lost rental income from the store closings 
also in  linens n things  a tenant at three of our investment properties filed for bankruptcy 
as of december   all three of the leases were rejected and the stores closed 
linens n things represented less than one percent of our annual base rent 
leasing efforts are underway to find replacement tenants for these spaces at or above the rental rate that linens n things was paying 
circuit city  a tenant at two of our investment properties  also filed for bankruptcy in one of these locations is at an investment property owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
as of the date of this report  both leases have been rejected and liquidation sales are underway 
there continues to be concern surrounding the state of the economy 
not only are we seeing an increase in store closings and national tenant bankruptcies  but the local tenants are showing signs of stress as well  at our properties 
we are seeing our outstanding receivables rise  which in some cases requires us to record an allowance based on the collectability of these outstanding amounts 
as of december   we had recorded an allowance in the amount of approximately  related to these uncollectible amounts 
evictions are becoming more numerous and requests for rent reductions and abatements are becoming more frequent 
however  there are some strong retailers who are seeking to increase their presence 
we believe that our properties are well located and offer prime locations for these expansions 
real estate is subject to a wide range of cyclical conditions that affect different markets at different times and in different ways 
the current economic state is one that has not been seen recently 
the decline in the debt and credit markets has caused some tenants to be unable to fulfill their lease obligations and could affect our ability to retain them or attract new tenants 
we believe that the quality of our investment properties is strong as shown by our historically high occupancy rates 
during  we did experience an overall increase in rental rates on new and renewing leases 
with the expectation of additional store closings in  we are proactive with our leasing strategies 
we monitor retailers financial condition  and with indications of increased risk  we begin marketing their space in advance of any announced closings or bankruptcies 
when we find replacement tenants  we negotiate early lease terminations with the at risk tenant 
additionally  we monitor sales performance and occupancy costs of individual locations and with indications of weak sales  we attempt to assist the tenant with marketing assistance to increase their sales  while simultaneously seeking replacement tenants 
nevertheless  as a result of the current state of the economy  we expect leasing will be challenging in we believe we have significant acquisition opportunities due to our reputation and our concentration of properties in the chicago and minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan areas 
we will use cash provided by our dividend reinvestment plan  draws on our line of credit facility  earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders or additional equity offerings to purchase additional investment properties and make investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures 
our largest expenses relate to the operation of our properties as well as the interest expense on our mortgages payable and other debt obligations 
our property operating expenses include  but are not limited to  real estate taxes  regular maintenance  landscaping  snow removal and periodic renovations to meet tenant needs 
pursuant to the lease agreements  most tenants of the property are required to reimburse us for some or all of the particular tenant s pro rata share of the real estate taxes and operating expenses of the property 
in light of the current economic conditions  it is possible that we will recover less of our costs as tenants begin to feel more stress from the economy on their businesses and cash flows and begin to default on their lease obligations or seek rent reductions 
we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental non gaap measure to compare our performance and operations to that of other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit  an industry trade group  has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives payable by us to certain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental non gaap measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and gains loss on non operating property 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it refle ct trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we believe ebitda is an important supplemental measure because we utilize ebitda to calculate our interest expense coverage ratio  which equals ebitda divided by total interest expense 
we believe that including ebitda and thereby excluding the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  all of which are based on historical cost and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  facilitates comparison of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  particularly in light of the use of ebitda by a seemingly large number of reits in their reports on forms q and k 
we believe that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required us gaap measures of our performance to improve their understanding of our operating results 
we look at several factors to measure our operating performance to measure our operating results to those of other retail real estate owners operators in our area  we compare occupancy percentage  and our rental rates to the average rents charged by our competitors in similar centers 
to measure our operating results to those of other reits  we compare company wide growth in income or ffo  same store growth in income  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of investment in properties 
based on the above measures  we have historically performed comparably with those in our property sector peer group 
there are costs and issues associated with re leasing our properties  including length of time required to fill vacancies  possibly releasing at rental rates lower than current market rates  leasing costs associated with the new lease such as leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances  and paying operating expenses without tenant reimbursements 
strategies and objectives our primary business objective is to enhance the performance and value of our investment properties through management strategies that address the needs of an evolving retail marketplace 
our success in operating our centers efficiently and effectively is  we believe  a direct result of our expertise in the acquisition  development re development  either directly or through a joint venture  management and leasing of our properties 
we focus on the following areas in order to achieve our objectives acquisitions we seek to selectively acquire well located open air retail centers 
we acquire properties either without financing contingencies or by assuming existing debt to provide us with a competitive advantage over other potential purchasers requiring financing or financing contingencies 
we concentrate our property acquisitions in areas where we have a large market concentration 
in doing this  we believe we are able to attract new retailers to the area and possibly lease several locations to them 
additionally  we are able to get existing retailers to lease more space at our current investment properties 
joint ventures we have formed joint ventures to acquire stabilized retail properties as well as properties to be re developed and vacant land to be developed 
we earn fees from the joint ventures for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
we have formed a joint venture to acquire properties that will ultimately be sold through an offering of tenant in common interests in properties to investors 
we earn fees from the joint venture for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
operations we actively manage costs to minimize operating expenses by centralizing all management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting and data processing activities 
we seek to improve rental income and cash flow by aggressively marketing rentable space 
we emphasize regular maintenance and periodic renovation to meet the needs of tenants and to maximize long term returns 
we maintain a diversified tenant base consisting primarily of retail tenants providing consumer goods and services 
we proactively review our existing portfolio for potential re development opportunities 
development joint ventures our development joint ventures with five independent partners are designed to leverage what we believe are the unique strengths of each development team  while potentially diversifying our risk 
our development partners have historically identified opportunities  assembled and completed the entitlement process for the land  and gauged national big box retailer interest in the location before bringing the project to us for right of first refusal 
we typically contribute financing  leasing  and property management expertise to enhance productivity of the new developments and are typically entitled to earn a preferred return on our portion of invested capital 
as noted herein  the retail sector is experiencing significant stress resulting in considerable declines in leasing activity and deferral of retailer expansion plans 
our existing developments described below were originally scheduled for completion primarily during and many of these projects have  however  been delayed and will require us to invest additional capital to preserve some or all of our existing investment in these ventures 
we estimate having to invest approximately  to  in for this purpose 
further  a total of  in debt incurred by these joint ventures matures in and  in as of december   we were obligated under guarantees for approximately  of the debt incurred by these ventures 
we are engaged in discussions with the various lenders to extend or restructure this joint venture debt although there is no assurance that we  or our joint venture partners  will be able to restructure this debt on terms and conditions we find acceptable  if at all

wayne in savannah crossing tmk development  inc aurora il critical accounting policies general a critical accounting policy is one that  we believe  would materially affect our operating results or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and allocation of investment properties  determining whether assets are held for sale  recognition of rental income and lease termination income  our cost capitalization and depreciation policies and consolidation equity accounting policies 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
us gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties that were taken into consideration upon the application of critical accounting policies and t he likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
valuation and allocation of investment properties 
on a quarterly basis  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we review impairment indicators and  if necessary  conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each investment property does not exceed its estimated fair value 
we evaluate our investment properties to assess whether any impairment indicators are present  including recurring operating losses  significant decreases in occupancy and significant adverse changes in legal factors or business climate 
if an investment property is considered impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment loss of related to an  square foot neighborhood retail center located in madison  wisconsin 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment loss of related to a  square foot single user retail center located in decatur  illinois 
these impairment losses are included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income since the properties have been sold 
no such losses were required or recorded in the accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended december  in determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired  management considers several factors  such as projected rental and vacancy rates  property operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest rates 
the capitalization rate used to determine property valuation is based on the market in which the property is located  length of leases  tenant financial strength  the economy in general  demographics  environment  property location  visibility  age  physical condition and investor return requirements among others 
market capitalization rates fluctuate based on factors such as interest rates 
an increase in capitalization rates might result in a market valuation lower than our original purchase price 
additionally  we obtain an appraisal prepared by a third party at the time we purchase the investment property 
all of these factors are equally considered by management in determining the value of any particular property 
the value of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain factors  either individually or taken as a whole 
should the actual results differ from management s projections  the valuation could be negatively or positively affected 
we allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property between land  building and improvements  other intangibles including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases  customer relationships and acquired in place leases and any financing assumed that is determined to be above or below market terms 
purchase price allocations are based on our estimates 
the value allocated to land as opposed to building affects the amount of depreciation expense we record 
if more value is attributed to land  depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to building and improvements 
in some circumstances we engage independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocation 
we determine whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for simila r investment properties 
the aggregate value of other intangibles is measured based on the difference between the purchase price and the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize information contained in independent appraisals and management s estimates to determine the respective as if vacant property values 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases and the risk adjusted cost of capital 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  up to months 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expens es 
we allocate the difference between the purchase price of the property and the as if vacant value first to acquired above and below market leases 
we evaluate each acquired lease based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and consider various factors including geographic location  size and location of leased space within the investment property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to the acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
the determination of the discount rate used in the present value calculation is based upon a rate for each individual lease and primarily based upon the credit worthiness of each individual tenant 
the values of the acquired above and below mar ket leases are amortized over the life of each respective lease as an adjustment to rental income 
we then allocate the remaining difference to the value of acquired in place leases and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of specific leases and our overall relationship with the respective tenants 
the evaluation of acquired in place leases consists of a variety of components including the costs avoided associated with originating the acquired in place lease  including but not limited to  leasing commissions  tenant improvement costs and legal costs 
we also consider the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs and rental income estimated to be incurred during the assumed re leasing period 
the value of the acquired in place lease is amortized over the average lease term as a component of amortization expense 
we also consider whether any customer relationship value exists related to the property acquisition 
as of december   we had not allocated any amounts to customer relationships 
the valuation and possible subsequent impairment in the value of our investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s continuous process of analyzing each property 
cost capitalization and depreciation policies 
we review all expenditures and capitalize any item that is deemed to be an upgrade or a tenant improvement 
if we capitalize more items  current depreciation expense would be higher  however  total current expenses would be lower 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method 
buildings and improvements are depreciated based upon estimated useful lives of years for buildings and improvements  years for site improvements and the remaining life of the related lease for tenant improvements 
assets held for sale 
in determining whether to classify an asset as held for sale  we consider whether i management has committed to a plan to sell the asset  ii the asset is available for immediate sale  in its present condition  iii we have initiated a program to locate a buyer  iv we believe that the sale of the asset is probable  v we have received a significant non refundable deposit for the purchase of the property  vi we are actively marketing the asset for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value  and vii actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan 
if all of the above criteria are met  we classify the asset as held for sale 
on the day that these criteria are met  we suspend depreciation on the assets held for sale  including depreciation for tenant improvements and additions  as well as on the amortization of acquired in place leases and customer relationship values 
the assets and liabilities associated with those assets that are held for sale are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period 
additionally  the operations for the periods presented are classified on the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries 
under us gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining rent  generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease to both defe rred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectibility of outstanding receivables 
allowances are taken for those balances that we have reason to believe will be uncollectible  including any amounts relating to straight line rent receivables 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off 
tenant recoveries are primarily comprised of real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursement income 
real estate tax income is based on an accrual reimbursement calculated by tenant  based on an estimate of current year real estate taxes 
as actual real estate tax bills are received  we reconcile with our tenants and adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
common area maintenance income is accrued on actual common area maintenance expenses as incurred 
annually  we reconcile with the tenants for their share of the expenses per their lease and we adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
recognition of lease termination income 
we accrue lease termination income if there is a signed termination agreement  all of the conditions of the agreement have been met and the tenant is no longer occupying the property 
upon early lease termination  we provide for losses related to unrecovered intangibles and other assets 
consolidation equity accounting policies 
we consolidate the operations of a joint venture if we determine that we are either the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or have substantial influence and control of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual returns 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or the determination of who has control and influence of the entity 
when we consolidate an entity  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a variable interest entity are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in instances where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or we do not control the joint venture  we use the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the operations of a joint venture are not consolidated with our operations but instead our share of operations is reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
additionally  our net investment in the joint venture is reflected as investment in and advances to joint venture as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
investment in securities 
we classify our investment in securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities in which we have the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
investment in securities at december  and consist of perpetual preferred securities and common securities classified as available for sale securities  which are recorded at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary  results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and fasb fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
on october   the staff in the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission noted in a letter to the fasb that after consulting with the fasb  the staff would not object to the application of an impairment model for perpetual preferred securities similar to a debt security since sfas no 
does not specifically address the impac t of the debt like characteristics on the assessment of other than temporary impairment 
the letter noted that the views of the staff were an intermediate step in the process of addressing the impairment of perpetual preferred securities and asked the fasb to expeditiously address the issues 
there is no assurance that the fasb or the staff will formalize the views of the staff noted in the october  letter 
for an impaired security we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and consider whether the evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end and forecasted performance of the investee 
in addition  under the debt security model  an evaluation as to the underlying credit of the issuer is made 
however  without recovery in the near term such that liquidity returns to the markets and spreads return to levels that reflect underlying credit characteristics  additional other than temporary losses may occur in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources this section describes our balance sheet and discusses our liquidity and capital commitments 
our most liquid asset is cash and cash equivalents which consists of cash and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
see our discussion of the statements of cash flows for a description of our cash activity during  and we consider all demand deposits  money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less  at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions 
the combined account balances at one or more institutions periodically exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage and  as a result  there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposits in excess of fdic insurance coverag e 
however  we do not believe the risk is significant based on our review of the rating of the institutions where our cash is deposited 
income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources of cash include amounts raised from the sale of securities under our dividend reinvestment plan drp  our draws on our line of credit facility  which may be limited due to covenant compliance requirements  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders 
as of december   we were not in compliance with a debt covenant requiring us to reduce our outstanding secured indebtedness level 
however  a temporary waiver was obtained from the lender for the applicable covenant 
prior to the date of this annual report  we had cured the non compliance by retiring certain secured debt obligations 
we had up to  available under our  line of credit facility and an additional  available under an accordion feature 
if necessary  such as fo r new acquisitions  we believe we can generate capital by entering into financing arrangements or joint venture agreements with institutional investors 
we use our cash primarily to pay distributions to our stockholders  for operating expenses at our investment properties  for purchasing additional investment properties  joint venture commitments and to repay draws on the line of credit facility 
certain joint venture commitments require us to invest cash in properties under development and in properties that do not necessarily meet our investment criteria but which are offered for syndication through our joint venture with inland real estate exchange corporation 
capital has been committed for periods longer than expected since development timelines are longer and syndication velocity is slower than anticipated 
we invest in marketable securities of other entities  including reits 
these investments in securities totaled  at december   consisting of preferred and common stock investments 
during the year ended december   we recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss of  on these investment securities 
realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities are specifically identified and determined 
during the year ended december  and  we realized gains on sale of and  respectively 
additionally  during the years ended december  and  we realized losses of  and  respectively  related to a decline in value of certain investment securities which were determined to be other than temporary 
the overall stock market and reit stocks have declined over the last few months and although these investment have generated both current income and gain on sale during the year ended december   there is no assurance that existing or future investments will generate any income or gains due to economic uncertainties that may occur in the future and they may generate a loss 
declines in the value of our investment securities may also impact our ability to borrow on margin in the future 
as of december   our margin loan balance was  as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including those owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
in the aggregate  all of our investment properties are currently generating sufficient cash flow to pay our operating expenses  debt service requirements and distributions equal to per share on an annual basis

the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities statements of cash flows compared to net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  decreased  as compared to the year ended december   which consists primarily of net income from property operations 
this decrease was primarily the result of decreased cash received from our tenants and the payment of larger common area maintenance expenses on our investment properties during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  additionally  we received less operating distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  decreased  as compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we acquired six investment properties  all of which were for our joint venture with irex  at a cost of  and completed  in additions to our investment properties  as compared to ten investment properties purchased during the year ended december   of which nine were for our joint venture with irex  at a cost of  and completed  in additions 
additionally  during the year ended december   we received more cash from the sale of joint venture interests related to the sales to tic investors through our irex joint venture and the sale of investment properties in our wholly owned portfolio 
during the year ended december   we also received payment upon the maturity of our mortgage receivable with tri land properties  inc  spent less on the purchase of computers and software  invested less cash in  and received fewer distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   decreased  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is a result of using approximately  during the year ended december  to repurchase certain of our convertible notes 
additionally  we had net payments on our line of credit facility of approximately  during the year ended december   as compared to net proceeds of  received during the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease in cash provided by financing activities is cash received from our  term loan that we closed during the year ended december  and receiving approximately  additional proceeds from our drp 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  increased  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in cash was from operations generated by properties acquired during and  subsequent to their acquisitions 
this increase is offset by the payment of larger common area maintenance expenses on our investment properties due primarily to increased snow removal costs incurred during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities increased  as we acquired ten investment properties  of which nine were for our joint venture with irex  during the year ended december  at a cost of  and completed  in additions to our investment properties  as compared to the acquisition of six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  and the completion of  in additions to our investment properties 
additionally  we increased our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures by  primarily for the purchase of vacant land through our development joint ventures and paid approximately  for the purchase of computers and software 
certain payments for computers and software were made to affiliates of the inland group  inc for development and implementation support 
offsetting this increase in cash used is proceeds received during for the sale of our interest in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures  the sale of vacant land parcels through other unconsolidated joint ventures and additional distributions from our unconsolidated joint venture activities 
additionally  we received funds from the sale of tenant in common tic interests of properties owned through our joint venture with irex 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  increased  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to net loan proceeds of  and net proceeds from our line of credit facility of  as compared to net loan proceeds of  and a repayment on our line of credit facility of  during the year ended december  additionally  we received  more in proceeds from our drp during the year ended december  this increase is offset by proceeds received in for the issuance of our convertible notes

these decreases were partially offset by the deferred partnership gain recognized upon repayment of our mortgage receivable with tri land properties  inc  an increase in gains on sale of certain investment securities  a decrease in interest expense and gains on the extinguishment of debt resulting from the repurchase of certain convertible notes 
net income decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was impacted by gains on sale of investment properties that exceeded gains during the year ended december  additionally interest expense for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  due primarily to interest on our convertible notes 
the decreases in net income for the year ended december  are partially offset by increases in fee income  gain on sale of joint venture interests and vacant land from our unconsolidated joint ventures 
this section describes and compares our results of operations for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had ownership interests in single user properties  neighborhood centers  community centers  power centers and lifestyle center 
we generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations 
in order to evaluate our overall portfolio  management analyzes the net operating income of properties that we have owned and operated for the same twelve month periods during each year 
property net operating income is a non gaap measure that allows management to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and we are able to determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income 
net operating income is also meaningful as an indicator of the effectiveness of our management of properties because net operating income excludes certain items that are not reflective of management  such as depreciation and interest expense 
a total of of our investment properties satisfied these criteria during the periods presented and are referred to herein as same store properties 
these properties comprise approximately million square feet 
a total of six investment properties  those that have been acquired during the years ended december   and are presented as other investment properties in the table below 
the same store investment properties represent approximately of the square footage under management at december  the following table presents the operating results  broken out between same store and other investment properties  prior to straight line rental income  amortization of lease intangibles  interest  depreciation  amortization and bad debt expense for the years ended december   and along with reconciliation to income from continuing operations  calculated in accordance with us gaap

the primary reasons for the increase in rental and additional rental income for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december  and was income generated by our other investment properties and positive leasing spreads on our same store properties 
additionally  tenant recovery income and other property income increased during tenant recovery income increased as a result of higher property operating expenses during other property income is comprised of lease termination fees  late fees and costs recovered on expenses directly related to specific tenants

total property operating expenses for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in expenses is due primarily to an increase in common area maintenance expenses on our same store portfolio of properties 
the increases are related to increased payroll and other related items  landscaping costs and snow removal costs 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in parking lot and roof repairs required during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  total property operating expenses for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase in these expenses is due to higher snow removal costs in both the first and fourth quarters of  as compared to additionally  payroll and other payroll related items as well as expenses recovered directly from specific tenants increasing during the year ended december    as compared to the year ended december other income decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for this decrease was less interest income from mortgages receivable during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to the repayment of our mortgage receivable with tri land properties  inc in june offsetting this decrease in other income during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  is an increase in dividend income on our securities portfolio and gains on sale related to securities sold during the year ended december  other income decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this is due to a decrease in dividend income and gains on sale of our investment securities 
impairment of investment securities increased  due to recording a non cash charge of approximately  during the year ended december   related to a decline in value of certain investment securities which were determined to be other than temporary  compared to only during the year ended december  no such impairments were recorded during the year ended december  fee income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
these increases are due to an increase in acquisition fees earned on the properties acquired by our joint venture with irex and increased management fees earned on a larger portfolio of properties in our unconsolidated joint ventures 
gain on extinguishment of debt for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
we did not record any such gain during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the gain relates to the repurchase of certain of our convertible notes at a discount to the contract amount 
during the year ended december   the gain relates to the sale of an investment property in which the buyer assumed the loan  prior to its maturity 
gain on sale of joint venture interests for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
we did not record any such gains during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded gains of approximately  in connection with sales to tic investors through our joint venture with irex 
additionally  we recorded the gain previously deferred in conjunction with the repayment of our mortgage receivable with tri land properties  inc in the amount of approximately  during the year ended december   we recorded gains of approximately in connection with sales to tic investors through our irex joint venture and a gain of  in connection with the sale of our interest in our joint venture with crow holdings managers  llc 
bad debt expense for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the increase in bad debt expense is due to increased tenant bankruptcies and the current economic challenges facing our tenants 
general and administrative expenses increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due in part to an increase in salaries and other payroll related items  an increase in marketing costs due to the redesign of our website and additional costs incurred on potential transactions that we are no longer pursuing 
general and administrative expenses increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in salaries and other payroll related items  bonuses  data processing costs and costs incurred on potential transactions that we are no longer pursuing 
additionally  our conference expenses were higher during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to additional costs for the annual international council of shopping centers convention an industry trade show  which included more space to accommodate our new booth 
interest expense decreased  due to a decrease in interest on our mortgages payable and line of credit facility due to lower outstanding balances maintained throughout the year and a decrease in the rates charged on our variable rate debt 
this decrease is offset by an increase in interest due on the  term loan that we closed during the year ended december  interest expense increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due to interest due for the convertible notes issued in november we issued those convertible notes in order to take advantage of the low fixed interest rate 
these notes are fixed at a rate of per annum 
offsetting this increase in interest expense is a decrease in interest on our mortgages payable and line of credit facility due to lower balances outstanding during each year 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is due in part to a decrease in operations due to losses incurred during the year ended december  through our joint venture with nystrs 
the losses result from increased vacancies  primarily the result of certain tenant bankruptcies 
this decrease is offset by our share of a lease termination fee for a tenant at one of our nystrs joint venture properties in the amount of approximately  recorded during the year ended december  additionally  we recorded higher land sale gains during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due in most part to income generated from the properties acquired through our joint venture with irex

our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from these ventures is reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
additionally  we earn fees for providing property management  leasing and acquisition activities to these ventures 
we recognize only our share of these fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
during the year ended december   we earned  in fee income from our unconsolidated joint ventures  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this fee income increased due in most part to acquisition fees on the properties purchased for our joint venture with irex as well as increased management fees on an increased number of properties in our unconsolidated joint ventures 
thes e fees are reflected on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income as fee income from unconsolidated joint ventures 
the operations of properties contributed to the joint ventures by us are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement with these shopping centers 
differences between our investment in the joint ventures and the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of the joint ventures are due to basis differences resulting from our equity investment recorded at its historical basis versus the fair value of certain of our contributions to the joint venture 
such differences are amortized over depreciable lives of the joint venture s property assets 
during the years ended december   and we recorded   and  respectively  of amortization of this basis difference 
we have guaranteed approximately  of unconsolidated joint venture debt as of december  these guarantees are in effect for the entire term of each respective loan as set forth in the loan documents 
we would be required to make payments related to these guarantees upon the default of any of the provisions in the loan documents

our joint ventures may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument is designed to reduce that exposure 
certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures entered into interest rate swap contracts to limit their exposure to variable interest rates 
these derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges and therefore qualify for hedge accounting 
the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
we recorded our pro rata share of unrealized losses of approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively  which is included as a component of other comprehensive income expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income and as a component of investments in and advances to joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

our valuation of our derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative and therefore fall into level of the fair value hierarchy 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including forward curves

non gaap financial measures we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a non gaap supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives payable by us to certain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
the following table reflects our ffo for the periods presented  reconciled to net income available to common stockholders for these periods for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net income available to common stockholders gain on sale of investment properties  net of minority interest a equity in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures amortization on in place lease intangibles amortization on leasing commissions depreciation  net of minority interest funds from operations net income available to common stockholders per weighted average common share basic and diluted funds from operations  per weighted average common share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding  basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted distributions declared distributions per common share distributions funds from operations payout ratio a gains on sale of non operating property are excluded from this adjustment 
ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and gains loss on non operating property 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital nee ded to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we believe ebitda is an important supplemental measure because we utilize ebitda to calculate our interest expense coverage ratio  which equals ebitda divided by total interest expense 
we believe that including ebitda and thereby excluding the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  all of which are based on historical cost and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  facilitates comparison of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  particularly in light of the use of ebitda by a seemingly large number of reits in their reports on forms q and k 
we believe that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required us gaap measures of our performance to improve their understanding of our operating results

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  except for share based payment transactions under sfas r 
we were required to apply the guidance of sfas beginning january  however  in november the effective date of sfas as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis was deferred for one year 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas allows entities to voluntarily choose  at specified election dates  to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities as well as certain non financial instruments that are similar to financial instruments at fair value 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  sfas specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument shall be reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected not to adopt the fair value option for any such financial assets and liabilities 
the fasb has issued fasb staff position no 
apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement the fsp that requires separate accounting for the debt and equity components of convertible instruments 
the fsp requires that the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value of a similar bond without the conversion feature  which results in the debt being recorded at a discount

under sfas  the fasb is responsible for identifying the sources of accounting principles and providing entities with a framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with us gaap 
the fasb believes that the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with us gaap 
accordingly  the f asb concluded that the gaap hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the fasb and is issuing this statement to achieve that result 
the fasb does not expect that this statement will result in a change in current practice

inflation our long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of our leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   and we had no material derivative instruments  on a consolidated basis 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument is designed to reduce that exposure 
gains or losses related to the derivative financial instrument would be deferred and amortized over the terms of the hedged instrument 
if a derivative terminates or is sold  the gain or loss is recognized 
we will generally only enter into derivative transactions that satisfy the aforementioned criteria 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt consists of variable interest rate loans 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting this debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques  including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt 
also  existing fixed and variable rate loans which are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing or extension based on our view of the current interest rate environment 
the table below presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  including monthly annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate variable rate debt weighted average interest rate the table above does not reflect indebtedness incurred after december  our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of the adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness  fixed rate debt that matures and needs to be refinanced and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
the fair value of debt is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties 
at december   the fair value of our debt is estimated to be  for debt which bears interest at variable rates and  for debt which bear interest at fixed rates 
we estimate the fair value of our debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by our lenders 
at december   approximately  or  of our debt has variable interest rates averaging 
an increase in the variable interest rates charged on debt containing variable interest rate terms  constitutes a market risk 
a annualized increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately for the year ended december
