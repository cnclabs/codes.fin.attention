back we are a medical technology company that develops and manufactures an innovative device designed to administer high dose chemotherapy and other therapeutic agents directly to diseased organs or regions of the body 
we are currently focusing on the development of a single product  the delcath php system  for the treatment of tumors of the liver 
based on human clinical data  we believe that the delcath php system allows physicians to deliver significantly higher chemotherapy doses to the liver than could be administered by conventional intravenous delivery 
the delcath php system is a disposable kit consisting of various catheters  filters  and a tubing circuit used during cancer treatment to isolate the liver from the patient s general circulatory system 
our system allows for ultra high doses of chemotherapy agents to be directed at a patient s liver while at the same time limiting the exposure of healthy tissue and organs to the harmful effects of those chemotherapeutic agents 
by providing higher dosing of chemotherapy agents than would otherwise be possible through conventional chemotherapy  we believe that treatment with the delcath php system is more effective than conventional treatment at killing cancer cells and preventing new cancer cell formation 
in we began a phase iii clinical trial to support a pre market approval application for use of the delcath php system with melphalan  a chemotherapy agent  for the treatment of metastatic melanoma that has spread to the liver 
the trial is being conducted under the food and drug administration s fda special protocol assessment spa 
patients enrolled in this study currently receive treatment at the national cancer institute  or nci  which serves as the coordinating center for this multi center trial or at one of the other participating centers 
the trial is currently approved for expansion to a maximum of centers 
in april  the institutional review board of the university of maryland medical center agreed to participate in our phase iii study 
in june  st 
luke s cancer center  the albany medical center  the atlantic melanoma center of atlantic health and the university of texas medical branch joined this clinical trial 
in the third quarter  swedish medical center of colorado  john wayne cancer institute  providence health systems  and moffitt cancer center agreed to join the clinical trial 
in the fourth quarter of  university of pittsburgh medical center agreed to join the trial which brings the total to eleven centers 
each of the center s institutional review board irb has approved our treatment protocol 
critical to expediting completion of this trial  the western international review board  or wirb  has also approved our protocol 
the wirb  which provides review services for more than institutions academic centers  hospitals  networks and in house biotech research in all states and internationally  will help accelerate the internal review process at a number of the hospitals currently participating in the study 
as of december  we have enrolled a total of patients of the expected patient trial 
we expect to complete patient enrollment in this study in once the fda grants approval  we plan to conduct additional pre clinical and clinical trials on the use of the delcath php system with other chemotherapy agents used to treat cancer in the liver and seek additional fda pre market approvals 
in we began a multi arm phase ii clinical trial for the use of the delcath php system with melphalan in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas as well as neuroendocrine and adenocarcenoma cancers that have spread to the liver 
in an additional arm was added to the phase ii trial to treat patients with metastatic melanomas that have spread to the liver who have received prior surgical isolated hepatic perfusion 
based on promising initial clinical results  we plan to focus our efforts on enrolling patients for the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine cancer 
we have currently enrolled of the patients required for the neuroendocrine arm of the trial and we anticipate that we will complete patient enrollment in this arm of the study in as indicated above  the company is focusing on enrolling patients in the neuroendocrine arm of the phase ii study 
the other two arms treating colorectal cancer and primary liver cancer will be refocused so as to optimize the progress of those arms of the trial 
the company has entered into a dialogue with the fda concerning a clinical trial that will focus on the effectiveness of the delcath php system in administering high dose doxorubicin as compared with standard systemic treatment with sorafenib for the treatment of primary liver cancer 
in september  the company received a conditional approval from the fda to begin working on that trial 
the successful development of the delcath php system is highly uncertain  and development costs and timelines can vary significantly and are difficult to accurately predict 
various statutes and regulations also impact the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of our system 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials  seeking fda approval and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially  adversely affect our business 
to date  we have not received approval for the sale of our system in any market and  therefore  have not generated any revenues 
the delcath php system has not yet been approved by the fda and may not be marketed in the united states without fda pre market approval 
during the next twelve months we plan to hire additional personnel to support the development of the delcath php system 
in june and july we hired two senior executives 
we hired a chief medical officer to oversee the expansion of clinical activity  moving us towards the conclusion of our first phase iii clinical trial 
we also hired a senior vice president for regulatory affairs and quality systems  a position newly created to manage the extensive fda process 
our expenses generally include costs for clinical studies  securing patents  regulatory activities  manufacturing  personnel  rent for our facilities  and general corporate and working capital  including general and administrative expenses 
because we have no fda approved product and no commercial sales  we will continue to be dependent upon existing cash  the sale of equity or debt securities  or establishing a strategic alliance with appropriate partners to fund future activities 
we cannot be assured that the pace of patient enrollment will meet our projections  that we will obtain fda approval for our delcath php system  that we will have  or could raise  sufficient financial resources to sustain our operations pending fda approval  or that  if and when the required approvals are obtained  there will be a market for any of our products 

back the company s expenditures are highly variable and are dependent upon the number and pace of patients enrolled in our clinical trials 
we expect that the amount of capital required for our trials will increase over the coming twelve months due to the increased number of patients enrolled at newly added clinical trial centers 
we believe that we have sufficient capital for operations through and to substantially advance our ongoing phase iii trial 
we are a development stage company  and since our inception we have raised approximately million net of fundraising expenses 
we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities 
we have incurred net losses since we were founded and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net losses over the coming years 
liquidity and capital resources our future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
we have operated at a loss for our entire history and we anticipate that losses will continue over the coming years 
there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
we expect to use cash  cash equivalents and investment proceeds to fund our operating activities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and product development programs  including our ongoing phase ii and phase iii clinical trials  the timing and costs of making various united states and foreign regulatory filings  obtaining approvals and complying with regulations  the timing and effectiveness of product commercialization activities  including marketing arrangements overseas  the timing and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
we continue to move forward aggressively  most notably by adding new sites to our ongoing clinical trials and increasing our efforts to enroll additional patients in these trials 
as we seek fda approval and get our product to market we expect that our capital expenditures will increase significantly 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  as compared to  at december  nearly all of our available funds are currently invested in money market funds and certificates of deposit  which are reflected in our financial statements as cash and cash equivalents 
at december   in addition to cash and cash equivalents totaling  we had  invested in treasury bills which were listed separately from cash and cash equivalents in our financial statements 
at december   treasury bills plus cash and cash equivalents had a combined value of  during the twelve months ended december   we used  of cash in our operating activities 
this amount compares to  used in our operating activities during the comparable twelve month period ended december  the increase of  or  is primarily due to accelerated clinical development costs relating to all facets of the delcath php system 
we expect that our cash allocated to operating activities will increase significantly as we aggressively move toward the full enrollment and completion of our first phase iii clinical trial  and continue to navigate the extensive fda approval process 
we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our current clinical trials through at december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
because our business does not generate any positive cash flow from operating activities  we will likely need to raise additional capital to develop our product beyond the current clinical trials or to fund development efforts relating to new products 
we anticipate that we could raise additional capital in the event that we find it in our best interest to do so 
we anticipate raising such additional capital by either borrowing money  selling shares of our capital stock  or entering into strategic alliances with appropriate partners 
to the extent additional capital is not available when we need it  we may be forced to abandon some or all of our development and commercialization efforts  which would have a material adverse effect on the prospects of our business 
further  our assumptions relating to our cash requirements may differ materially from those planned because of a number of factors  including significant unforeseen delays in the regulatory approval process  changes in the focus and direction of our clinical trials and costs related to commercializing our product 
we have funded our operations through a combination of private placements of our securities and through the proceeds of our public offerings in and along with our registered direct offering in please see the detailed discussion of our various sales of securities described in note contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as long term research and development agreement obligations and lease agreements 
the following table provides a summary of our significant contractual obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total operating activities research activities operating leases 
back we have an operating lease for office space that will expire on july   with a rent obligation of  per annum 
our five year crada for the development of the delcath php system with the nci expired on december  and has been extended for an additional five years to december  the principal goal of the crada is to continue the development of a novel form of regional cancer therapy by designing clinical protocols utilizing the delcath php system to regionally deliver chemotherapeutics to patients with unresectable malignancies confined to an organ or region of the body 
under the five year extension  we will pay  per year for clinical support 
these funds are payable in quarterly amounts of  and will be used for material support of the crada including equipment  supplies  travel  and other related crada support  as well as for support of existing or new scientific or clinical staff to be hired by nci who are to perform work under the crada 
future capital needs  additional future funding our future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
we have operated at a loss for our entire history and there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve consistent profitability 
we believe that our capital resources are adequate to fund operations for the next twelve months  but anticipate that we will require additional working capital to continue our operations after the year ended december  there can be no assurance that such working capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
results of operations for the year ended december   comparisons of results of the years ended december  and we have operated at a loss for our entire history 
we had a net loss for the twelve months ended december   of  which is  or  more than the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this increase is primarily due to increased research and development costs due to an acceleration of patient enrollment as discussed below 
additionally  the warrants issued in as part of our sale of common stock are considered to be derivatives and are subject to valuation and adjustment on a quarterly basis see item a  below for a complete description 
this mark to market adjustment of the warrant valuation resulted in the recording of  in derivative instrument income for the year ended december   a  decrease from the  of derivative instrument income recorded in the year ended december  this fluctuation accounts for approximately fifty percent of the difference in net loss between and we had a net loss for the twelve months ended december   of  which is  or  less than the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this substantial decrease is primarily due to the resolution of various legal matters that had been instituted in  and their related extraordinary costs which were incurred in there were  however  additional expenses relating to a five year extension to the crada with the nci that initially expired in december this extension was necessary for continuing and expanding the collaboration between the company and the nci  but will result in greater costs to the company 
the agreement with the nci required that the annual payments to them be increased five fold from the previous agreement 
additionally  the warrants that were issued in as part of the company s sale of common stock and warrants are considered to be derivatives and are subject to valuation and adjustment on a quarterly basis 
this resulted in the recording of derivative instrument income for the year of  which substantially reduced the net loss from continuing operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by less than from  during the twelve months ended december   to  for the twelve months ended december  an increase in fees paid to board of director members as well as an increase in insurance related costs during was offset primarily by a reduction of payroll related expenses charged to general and administrative which accounted for slight increase in the expense during fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased by from  during the twelve months ended december   to  for the twelve months ended december  while legal fees incurred during were substantially less than those incurred in and would have resulted in a greater reduction in period to period expenses due to the resolution of various legal matters  additional charges to general and administrative expenses were incurred in by share based compensation for options granted to new members of the board of directors  options granted to the president and chief executive officer  and options granted to newly hired management employees 
further  the cashless exercise of options by outgoing members of the board of directors resulted in additional charges to general and administrative expenses during research and development expenses during the twelve months ended december   we incurred  in research and development costs  which is a increase as compared to  of research and development costs we incurred during this increase is primarily due to the acceleration of enrollment in our phase iii trial 
with the addition of several trial sites throughout  we have seen a marked increase in the rate of patient enrollment and treatment which has had a noticeable impact on our research and development expenses 

back during the twelve months ended december   we incurred  in research and development costs  which is a increase as compared to  of research and development costs during this change was primarily due to additional expenses with the nci  as well as accelerated clinical development costs relating to all facets of the delcath php system which required greater expense but will hasten the progress toward final approval 
in addition  the company allocated share based compensation for stock and options awarded to personnel involved with research and development related initiatives 
interest income interest income generated during and is from our money market accounts and treasury bills 
during the twelve months ended december   we had interest income of  as compared to interest income of  for the same period in  a change 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduced cash position in from that in  as well as the overall market conditions which yielded a lower percentage return on our investments 
during the twelve months ended december   we had interest income of  as compared to interest income of  for the same period in  a change 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduced cash position in from that in the net proceeds from the sale of the company s common stock and warrants in september were received on the last day of the third quarter of fiscal and therefore did not have a material impact on annual interest income 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
certain accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in the financial statements 
the notes to financial statements included in item contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we are still in the development stage and have no revenues  trade receivables  inventories  or significant fixed or intangible assets  and therefore have very limited opportunities to choose among accounting policies or methods 
in many cases  we must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under gaap 
additionally  we devote substantial resources to clinical trials and other research and development activities relating to obtaining fda and other approvals for the delcath php system  the cost of which is required to be charged to expense as incurred 
this further limits our choice of accounting policies and methods 
similarly  management believes there are very limited circumstances in which our financial statement estimates are significant or critical 
we consider the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets to be a significant accounting estimate 
in applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  management estimates future taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
management believes the company does not have any uncertain tax positions as defined under fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas r 
sfas r establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation is measured at the grant date  based upon the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the option holders requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
effective january   the company adopted the modified prospective approach and  accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this approach  the company is required to record compensation cost for all share based payments granted after the date of adoption based upon the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and for the unvested portion of all share based payments previously granted that remain outstanding based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas the company has expensed its share based compensation for share based payments granted after january  under the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements  accordingly  the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the carrying values of the company s assets 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 

back level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in market interest rates that could affect the value of our investments 
however  the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and  therefore  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income 
in january  the company entered into a research and development agreement with aethlon medical  inc  aemd a publicly traded company whose securities are quoted on the over the counter bulletin board 
as part of this agreement  the company received  shares of restricted common stock of aemd 
the company allocated  of the cost of the agreement to the fair value of the common stock acquired  using the closing stock price at the date of the agreement and then discounting that value due to certain sale restrictions on the stock being held 
during the third quarter ending september   the restriction on the common stock held lapsed and as a result the fair value of the stock is calculated using the closing stock price unadjusted at december  the investment is classified as an available for sale security and had a fair value on december  of  which included a gross unrealized loss of  which is included as a component of comprehensive loss 
the company measures all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in contracts  at fair value and recognizes them in the balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on the company s rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
in  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock and the issuance of warrants to purchase  common shares in a private placement to institutional and accredited investors 
the company received net proceeds of  in this transaction 
the company allocated  of the total proceeds to warrants 
the shares were offered by the company pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on form s  which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on may  and was declared effective on june  file no 

the  in proceeds allocated to the warrants was classified as a liability in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the warrants may require cash settlement in the event of certain circumstances  including the company s inability to deliver registered shares upon the exercise of the warrants by such warrant holders 
the warrants also contain a cashless exercise feature in certain circumstances 
accordingly  the warrants have been accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities  which are subject to mark to market adjustment in each period 
as a result  for the twelve month period ended december   the company recorded pre tax derivative instrument income of  the resulting derivative instrument liability totaled  at december  management believes that the possibility of an actual cash settlement with a warrant holder of the recorded liability is quite remote  and expects that the warrants will either be exercised or expire worthless  at which point the then existing derivative liability will be credited to equity 
the fair value of the warrants was determined by using the black scholes model assuming a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life equal to the september  contractual life of the warrants
