item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains both historical financial information and forward looking statements 
neogen corporation management does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
while management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial results 
any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  seeks  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors  including competition  recruitment and dependence on key employees  impact of weather on agriculture and food production  identification and integration of acquisitions  research and development risks  patent and trade secret protection  government regulation and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s reports on file at the securities and exchange commission  that could cause neogen corporation s results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements  including those detailed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any forward looking statements represent management s views only as of the day this report on form k was first filed with the securities and exchange commission and should not be relied upon as representing management s views as of any subsequent date 
while management may elect to update forward looking statements at some point in the future  it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so  even if its views change 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates  including those related to receivable allowances  inventories and intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies reflect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally at the time of shipment 
where right of return exists  allowances are made at the time of sale to reflect expected returns based on historical experience 
accounts receivable allowance management attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers credit history before extending credit and by monitoring credit exposure on a regular basis 
an allowance for possible losses on accounts receivable is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information  such as changes in overall changes in customer credit and general credit conditions 
actual collections can differ from historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves could be required 

table of contents inventory a reserve for obsolescence is established based on an analysis of the inventory taking into account the current condition of the asset as well as other known facts and future plans 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations intangible assets and goodwill management assesses goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment on no less often than an annual basis 
this test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and it was determined that no impairment exists 
there was also no impairment indicated for or in the event of changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  management will make an assessment at any time 
factors that could cause an impairment review to take place would include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the use of acquired assets or strategy of the company 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets is compared to its fair value using undiscounted future cash flows of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amounts of these assets are greater than the amount of undiscounted future cash flows  such assets are reduced to their estimated fair value 
equity compensation plans financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment  sfas r addresses the accounting for share based employee compensation 
further information on the company s equity compensation plans  including inputs used to determine fair value of options is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r requires that share options awarded to employees and shares of stock awarded to employees under certain stock purchase plans are recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value at grant date 
the fair market value of options granted under the company s stock option plans was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for inputs such as interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and specific employee exercise behavior patterns based on statistical data 
some of the inputs used are not market observable and have to be estimated or derived from available data 
use of different estimates would produce different option values  which in turn would result in higher or lower compensation expense recognized 
to value options  several recognized valuation models exist 
none of these models can be singled out as being the best or most correct one 
the model applied is able to handle some of the specific features included in the options granted  which is the reason for its use 
if a different model were used  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using a different valuation model could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
fair value could be either higher or lower than the ones produced by the model applied and the inputs used

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has moderate interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure and no long term fixed rate investments or borrowings 
the company s primary interest rate risk is due to potential fluctuations of interest rates for variable rate borrowings 
because neogen markets and sells its products throughout the world  it could be affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce the demand for its products 
sales in certain foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound and euro 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
neogen has assets  liabilities and operations outside of the united states that are located primarily in ayr  scotland where the functional currency is the british pound sterling 
to a lesser extent it also has assets  liabilities and operations in mexico where the functional currency is the mexican peso 
the company s investment in its foreign subsidiaries are considered long term  accordingly  it does not hedge the net investment nor does it generally engage in other foreign currency hedging activities due to the insignificance of these balances to the company as a whole 
it does however use strategies to reduce current exposure to currency fluctuations
