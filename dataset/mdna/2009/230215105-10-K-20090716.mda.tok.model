the mattress fabrics segment primarily manufactures  sources  and sells fabrics to bedding manufacturers 
the upholstery fabrics segment sources  manufacturers and sells fabrics primarily to residential and commercial contract furniture manufacturers 
we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based upon income loss from operations before restructuring and related charges  certain unallocated corporate expenses  and other non recurring items

kg bodet horst related to its knitted mattress fabric operation 
the upholstery fabrics segment also includes assets held for sale in segment assets 
for fiscal  our overall net sales decreased to million  compared with million for fiscal this sales decrease reflects unprecedented weak consumer demand in both the bedding and furniture industries and the planned discontinuance of certain products in both segments 
the company reported a pre tax loss of million  which includes restructuring and related charges of million  for fiscal we reported pre tax income of million  which includes restructuring and related charges of million in fiscal the change in the our pre tax results primarily results from an increase in restructuring and related charges in the upholstery fabrics segment of million in fiscal compared with million  in fiscal of the million restructuring and related charges in fiscal  million and million represent non cash and cash charges  respectively

although the segment experienced an operating loss for fiscal  substantial improvement was achieved in the second half of fiscal  leading to an approximate  operating profit in the third and fourth quarters 
from a balance sheet perspective  in spite of the unprecedented weak consumer demand in the bedding and furniture industries and the resulting net loss  our financial position strengthened in fiscal our cash and cash equivalents were million at may  compared with million at april  this increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects cash flow from operations in fiscal of million compared with million in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations is due to consistent profitability in the mattress fabrics segment and working capital reductions in both segments

kg collectively bodet horst dated august   we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the knitted mattress fabric operation of bodet horst  including its manufacturing operation in high point  north carolina 
this purchase has allowed us to have a vertically integrated manufacturing platform in all major product categories of the mattress fabrics industry 
the purchase involved the equipment  inventory  and intellectual property associated with the high point manufacturing operation  which had served as our primary source of knitted mattress fabric for the prior six years 
demand for this product line has grown significantly  as knits are increasingly being utilized on mattresses at volume retail price points 
the purchase price for the assets was cash in the amount of million  which included an adjustment of  for changes in working capital as defined in the asset purchase agreement  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
also  in connection with the purchase  the we entered into a six year consulting and non compete agreement with the principal owner of bodet horst  providing for payments to the owner in the amount of  per year to be paid in quarterly installments of which  and  will be allocated to the non compete covenant and consulting fees  respectively for the agreement s full six year term

the allocation of the purchase price is based on a preliminary valuation and could change when the final valuation is obtained 
differences between the preliminary valuation and the final valuation are not expected to be significant 
the preliminary acquisition cost allocation is as follows dollars in thousands fair value inventories other current assets property  plant  and equipment non compete agreement goodwill accounts payable of the total consideration paid of   and were paid in fiscal and  respectively 
we recorded a non compete agreement at its fair value based on various valuation techniques 
this non compete agreement will be amortized on a straight line basis over the six year life of the agreement 
property  plant  and equipment will be depreciated on a straight line basis over useful lives ranging from five to fifteen years 
goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes over the statutory period of fifteen years

net sales for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported net sales of million compared with million for fiscal  a decrease of 
mattress ticking yards sold during fiscal were million compared with million yards sold in fiscal  a decrease of 
these trends reflect unprecedented weak consumer demand in the bedding industry and planned discontinuance of certain products from the itg acquisition completed in january the average selling price for fiscal was per yard compared with in fiscal  an increase of 
this trend reflects the continued shift in the product mix toward knitted fabrics  which have a higher average selling price 
gross profit for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported gross profit of million compared with million for fiscal despite the significant decline in net sales  gross profit margins increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal during fiscal the company took major actions to respond to the decrease in net sales 
first  we completed a million capital project to significantly strengthen our woven fabrics manufacturing operations and provide further reactive capacity to our customers 
the expanded capacity this capital project provides should effectively position the company to pursue further growth opportunities 
second  the acquisition of the knitted mattress fabrics operation of bodet horst has been successfully integrated into our operations and further enhanced the company s strong service platform with improved supply logistics from pattern inception to fabric delivery  allowing accelerated responsiveness and greater stability 
with the weaving expansion and the completion of the bodet horst acquisition  we now have a large and modern  vertically integrated manufacturing platform in all major product categories of the mattress fabrics industry

as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at april  this decrease is primarily due to lower sales volume in fiscal compared with fiscal and improved working capital management 
at may  and april   this segment had assets held for sale with carrying values totaling  and  respectively 
effective january   we adopted a plan to sell certain older equipment related to the mattress fabrics segment that was being replaced by newer and more efficient equipment 
in connection with the plan of disposal  we determined that the carrying value of this equipment was  which exceeded its fair value of  consequently  we recorded an impairment loss of  in fiscal this impairment loss of  was recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations

at may  and april   the carrying value of the segment s goodwill was million and million  respectively 
the increase in the carrying value of the non compete agreements and goodwill pertains to the bodet horst acquisition 
at may  and april   property  plant and equipment totaled million and million  respectively 
this increase reflects the completion of the million capital project and property  plant  and equipment purchased in connection with the bodet horst acquisition  offset by depreciation expense of million in fiscal the million balance at may   represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million

a detailed explanation of each of our significant restructuring plans for fiscal and is presented below 
september upholstery fabrics on september   our board of directors approved changes to the upholstery fabric operations  including the consolidation of plant facilities in china and the reduction of excess manufacturing capacity 
these actions were in response to the extremely challenging industry conditions for upholstery fabrics 
during fiscal  restructuring and related charges totaled million  of which million related to impairment charges on equipment and leasehold improvements  million for accelerated depreciation   for inventory markdowns   for lease termination and other exit costs   for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities  and  for employee termination benefits 
the million accelerated depreciation charge represents the incremental depreciation expense to reflect revised depreciation estimates and useful lives for certain fixed assets that were to be used over a shortened useful life from the period the restructuring plan was announced until the respective plant facility was closed and operations ceased 
of this total charge  million and million were recorded in restructuring expense and cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
december upholstery fabrics on december   our board of directors approved a restructuring plan within the upholstery fabrics segment to consolidate the company s us upholstery fabrics manufacturing facilities and outsource its specialty yarn production 
this process involved closing the company s weaving plant located in graham  north carolina  and closing the yarn plant located in lincolnton  north carolina 
we transferred certain production from the graham plant to its anderson  south carolina and shanghai  china plant facilities as well as a small portion to contract weavers 
as a result of these two plant closures  the company reduced the number of associates by approximately people 
during fiscal  we further assessed the net realizable value of our inventory  recoverability of our property  plant  and equipment  and selling  general  and administrative expenses based on current demand trends related to our us upholstery fabric operations 
this assessment was required based on the adverse economic conditions resulting from the depressed housing market  credit crisis  and decreased consumer spending that developed in the second quarter of fiscal  and which was more severe than we anticipated at the end of fiscal as a result  restructuring and related charges incurred were million of which million related to impairment charges on a building and equipment   related to inventory markdowns   related to employee termination benefits   related to lease termination and other exit costs  and  related to other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this total charge  million was recorded in restructuring expense   was recorded in cost of sales  and  was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  total restructuring and related charges incurred for this restructuring plan were million of which million related to inventory markdowns   related to other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities   related to write downs of buildings and equipment   related to lease termination and other exit costs   related to asset movement costs   related to employee termination benefits  and a credit of  related to sales proceeds received on equipment with no carrying value 
of this total charge  million was recorded in cost of sales   was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and  was recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
long lived asset impairments during fiscal  we incurred impairment charges on property  plant  and equipment in connection with its restructuring activities 
these impairment charges totaled million and were recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million impairment charge includes million for fixed assets that were abandoned in connection with the consolidation of certain plant facilities in china and  to reflect the selling price of the company s corporate headquarters of million 
also  during the course of the company s strategic review in the second quarter of fiscal of its upholstery fabrics business  the company assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of its upholstery fabric fixed assets that were being held and used in operations 
this strategic review resulted in impairment losses of million and  for fixed assets located in china and the us  respectively 
in addition  the company incurred impairment losses totaling  for assets held for sale associated with its u 
s upholstery fabric operations 
these losses reflect the amounts by which the carrying values of these fixed assets exceeded their estimated fair values determined by their estimated future discounted cash flows and quoted market prices 
net sales for fiscal  upholstery fabric net sales which include both fabric and cut and sewn kits were million compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of 
on a unit volume basis  total yards sold for fiscal decreased by compared with fiscal average selling price was per yard for fiscal compared with per yard in fiscal  an increase of 
upholstery fabrics sales represented approximately of total net sales for fiscal  down from in fiscal net sales of upholstery fabrics produced outside the company s us manufacturing operations were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal net sales of us produced upholstery fabrics were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal upholstery fabric sales reflect worsening soft demand industry wide  as well as worsening demand for us produced upholstery fabrics driven by consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and other imported furniture and fabrics 
gross profit for fiscal  the upholstery fabrics segment reported gross profit of million compared with million for fiscal gross profit margins were in fiscal compared with in fiscal in response to this decline in net sales and profits  the company took the following major actions as part of the profit improvement plan initiated during the second quarter of fiscal consolidated our china operations into fewer facilities and reduced excess manufacturing capacity 
see restructuring and related charges section for further details 
significantly reduced the cost structure of our us velvet operations located in anderson  sc 
implemented a modest price increase on certain upholstery fabrics  and wherever possible  obtained price concessions from suppliers on certain high volume items where we could not increase our selling prices continued focus on improved inventory management 
inventory was million at may   a decrease of from million at april as a result of the major actions noted above  the upholstery fabrics segment reported gross profit of million  or  in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with million  or  for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating loss income the upholstery fabrics segment reported an operating loss for fiscal of million compared with operating income of million in fiscal this trend reflects the decline in net sales noted above 
despite the decline in net sales in the fourth quarter million in and million in  the upholstery fabrics segment reported operating income of  or of net sales in fiscal  compared with  or of net sales  for fiscal the operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal reversed operating losses of million in the first half of fiscal these results reflect the major actions noted above as part of the profit improvement plan and the implementation of a plan that reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses by compared to the previous year 
this plan included reductions of base compensation for senior management of the upholstery fabrics segment 
management remains cautiously optimistic about the company s prospects in the upholstery fabrics business because of the following a we have been receiving significantly higher fabric placements  including cut and sew kits  with a broader base of key customers  b we have established a mature  scalable and low cost model in china that is vertically integrated by way of a network of key manufacturing partners that we developed over several years  c we have made significant progress in the competitive position of our us facility this year  and d we are now keenly focused on sales and marketing initiatives rather than restructuring actions 
although we believe these factors are all favorable indicators  management remains committed to taking additional steps if necessary to address the low profitability of the company s upholstery fabrics operations  regardless of prevailing economic and business conditions 
we could experience additional inventory markdowns and further restructuring charges in the upholstery fabric operations if sales and profitability continue to decline and further restructuring actions become necessary 
segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and assets held for sale 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at april  this decline reflects lower sales and improved working capital management 
at may   the upholstery fabrics reported no carrying value associated with property  plant and equipment 
property  plant  and equipment totaled million at april  this decline reflects restructuring charges of million for fixed asset impairments see restructuring and related charges section for more details  million related to accelerated depreciation in connection with the consolidation of plant facilities in china  and reclassifications of property  plant  and equipment to assets held for sale 
at may  and april   this segment had assets held for sale with a carrying value of million and  respectively 
assets held for sale represent buildings and equipment associated with our us upholstery fabric operations 
we expect that the final sale and disposal of these assets to be completed within a year 
the company determined that the carrying values of some of the underlying assets exceeded their fair values 
consequently  the company recorded an impairment charge totaling  and  in restructuring expense in the and consolidated statement of operations  respectively 
other income statement categories selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a for the company as a whole were million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal  a decrease of 
this trend primarily reflects the company s restructuring efforts and profit improvement plan associated with its upholstery fabrics segment  partially offset by an increase of  in the provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal interest expense income interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this trend primarily reflects lower outstanding balances on existing long term debt and a decrease in interest rates  partially offset by interest expense incurred on the million unsecured note used to finance the bodet horst acquisition 
interest income for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal this trend reflects a significant reduction in money market interest rates during fiscal other expense other expense for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal this change primarily reflects fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for subsidiaries domiciled in china and canada 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in the effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax basis of an asset or liability 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to a timing difference is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
effective income tax rate we recorded income tax expense of million  or of loss before income tax expense in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of  or of income before income taxes in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to loss before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate increased for a million non cash charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance against substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets 
the income tax rate increased for an increase in income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax rate increased for the tax effects of foreign exchange gains on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
in fiscal  the income tax rate decreased for the tax effects of foreign exchange losses on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
in fiscal and  the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar has been very volatile due to changes in oil prices and current global economic conditions 
the income tax rate increased for the recording of a deferred tax liability for estimated us income taxes that will be payable upon anticipated future repatriation of undistributed earnings from the company s subsidiaries located in china 
the income tax benefit for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to income before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate was reduced by for the tax effects of foreign exchange losses on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar has been very volatile due to changes in oil prices and the current global economic conditions 
the income tax rate was reduced by for the tax effects of a tax holiday for our subsidiaries located in china 
under a tax holiday in the people s republic of china  the company was granted an exemption from income taxes for two years commencing from the first profit making year on a calendar year basis and a reduction in income tax rates for the following three years 
calendar year was the first profit making year 
we were entitled to a income tax reduction through december  the income tax rate was reduced by for the tax effects of the tax holiday in china in fiscal this decrease compared with fiscal to lower pre tax income in fiscal for the company s china operations 
the company s pre tax income in china was million in calendar year the income tax rate was reduced by for research and development credits taken on our canadian income tax returns for fiscal years through we engaged a consultant in fiscal to assist management in documenting and determining the amount of these credits that could be deducted on the company s canadian tax returns 
the income tax rate was reduced by for income tax incentives granted by the chinese government for the start up of a cut and sew operation located in shanghai 
the income tax rate was increased by for an increase in income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits 
deferred income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture and mattresses  along with the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  has made it very difficult to forecast both short term and long term financial results  and therefore  present significant negative evidence as to whether we need to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on this significant negative evidence  we recorded a million valuation allowance during fiscal  of which million and million were against the net deferred tax assets of our us and china operations  respectively 
our net deferred tax asset primarily resulted from the recording of the income tax benefit of us income tax loss carryforwards over the last several years  which totals million 
this non cash charge of million has no effect on the company s operations  loan covenant compliance  or the possible utilization of the us income tax loss carryforwards in the future 
if and when the company utilizes any of these us income tax loss carryforwards to offset future us taxable income  the income tax benefit would be recognized at that time 
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were million with related future tax benefits of million at may  these carryforwards principally expire in years  fiscal through fiscal the company also has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that does not expire 
at may   the remaining current deferred tax asset was  and noncurrent deferred tax liability was  each of which  pertain to our operations in canada

during fiscal  total restructuring and related charges incurred for this restructuring plan were million of which million related to inventory markdowns  million related to employee termination benefits  million related to accelerated depreciation  million related to write downs of equipment   related to asset movement costs   related to lease termination and other exit costs  and  related to operating costs associated with the closed plant facilities 
the million accelerated depreciation charge represents incremental depreciation expense to reflect revised depreciation estimates and useful lives for certain fixed assets that were to be used over a shortened useful life from the period the restructuring plan was announced until the respective plant facility was closed and operations were ceased 
of this total charge  million was recorded in cost of sales and million was recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
april upholstery fabrics in april  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan within the upholstery fabrics segment designed to reduce costs  increase asset utilization  and improve profitability 
the restructuring plan included consolidation of our velvet fabrics manufacturing operations  fixed manufacturing cost reductions in the decorative fabrics operation  and significant reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses within the upholstery fabrics segment 
also  we combined our sales  design  and customer service activities within the upholstery fabrics segment 
as a result  on june  the company sold two buildings  both located in burlington  nc  consisting of approximately  square feet for proceeds of  overall  these restructuring actions reduced the number of associates by people 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring credit of  of which a charge of  related to lease termination and other exit costs and a credit of  related to employee termination benefits

on a unit volume basis  total yards sold for fiscal decreased by compared with fiscal average selling price was per yard for fiscal compared with per yard in fiscal upholstery fabrics sales represented approximately of total net sales for fiscal  down from in fiscal net sales of upholstery fabrics produced outside the company s us manufacturing operations were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal net sales of us produced upholstery fabrics were million in fiscal  a decrease of compared with million in fiscal upholstery fabric sales reflect continued soft demand industry wide  as well as continued weak demand for us produced upholstery fabrics driven by consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and other imported furniture and fabrics 
gross profit for fiscal  the upholstery fabrics segment reported gross profit of million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal despite the significant decline in net sales  the company was able to report a gross profit in this segment based on a significantly improved cost structure with its china platform and very aggressive restructuring actions over several years to bring its us manufacturing costs and capacity in line with current and expected demand trends 
operating income operating income for fiscal was million  or  of net sales compared to operating income for fiscal of million  or of net sales 
this segment was able to report operating income as a result of the improved cost structure with its china platform and restructuring actions regarding its us upholstery fabric operations 
in addition  selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million or compared with fiscal this reduction was due to the company s restructuring activities regarding its us upholstery fabric operations 
segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and assets held for sale 
as of april   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at april  this decline reflects lower sales and improved working capital management 
at april   property  plant and equipment totaled million  compared with million at april  at april   this segment had assets held for sale with a carrying value of  for certain equipment related to the company s us upholstery fabric operations 
in connection with the plan of disposal  the company determined that the carrying value of this equipment of  exceeded its fair value of  consequently  the company recorded an impairment loss of  in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations

r in fiscal  which requires all share based payments to be recognized as costs over the requisite service period based upon values as of the grant dates 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  total stock based compensation expense was  for fiscal and  for fiscal interest expense income interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this trend primarily reflects lower outstanding balances on our unsecured senior term notes 
interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this trend primarily reflects higher balances invested in money market funds throughout fiscal other expense other expense for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal this change primarily reflects fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for subsidiaries domiciled in china and canada 
income taxes effective income tax rate we recorded an income tax benefit of  or of income before income tax expense in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes in fiscal the income tax benefit for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to income before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate was reduced by for the tax effects of foreign exchange losses on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar was more volatile in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to changes in oil prices and the current global economic conditions 
the income tax rate was reduced by and for the tax effects of a tax holiday regarding the company s subsidiaries located in china in fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes regarding our china operations in fiscal compared to fiscal income before income taxes regarding our china operations was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the income tax rate was reduced by for research and development credits taken on our canadian income tax returns for fiscal years through we engaged a consultant in fiscal to assist management in documenting and determining the amount of these credits that could be deducted on the company s canadian tax returns 
the income tax rate was reduced by for income tax incentives granted by the chinese government for the start up of a cut and sew operation located in china in fiscal the income tax rate was reduced by for taxable income subject to lower statutory income tax rates in foreign jurisdictions canada and china compared with the statutory income tax rate of for the united states 
the income tax rate increased by for taxable income subject to lower statutory income taxes rates in foreign jurisdictions in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes from foreign operations 
income before income taxes from foreign operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the income tax rate was increased by for an increase in income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax benefit for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to loss before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate increased by for the tax effects of a tax holiday for our subsidiaries located in china 
the income tax rate increased by for taxable income subject to lower statutory income tax rates in foreign jurisdictions canada and china compared with the statutory income tax rate of for the united states 
the income tax rate increased by for the income tax benefit on state loss carryforwards in fiscal the income tax rate was reduced by for the income tax benefit on state loss carryforwards in fiscal this change is primarily due the decrease in pre tax losses in the us in fiscal compared to fiscal pre tax losses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the income tax rate was reduced by for an increase in income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax rate was reduced by for the write off of deferred tax assets associated with a non qualified stock option grant in which participants exercised their stock options at a lower stock price than was projected at the date of grant in which compensation expense for financial reporting was recorded 
unrecognized income tax benefits we adopted the provisions of fin on april  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of  to the april  balance of retained earnings 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of april   the date of adoption  was million  of which million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the income tax rate in future periods 
as of the date of adoption  the total amount of interest and penalties due to unrecognized tax benefits was  see notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
handling costs the company records warehousing costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
warehousing costs include the operating expenses of the company s various finished goods distribution centers  such as personnel costs  utilities  building rent and material handling equipment  and lease expense 
had these costs been included in cost of sales  gross profit would have been million  or  in fiscal  million  or  in fiscal  and million  or  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources liquidity our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  assets held for sale  and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit lines 
these sources have been adequate for day to day operations 
we believe our sources of liquidity continue to be adequate to meet the company s needs 
cash and cash equivalents as of may  were million compared with million as of april  the company s cash position reflects cash flow from operations in fiscal of million compared with million in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations is due to consistent profitability in the mattress fabrics segment and working capital reductions in both segments 
key measures for working capital  such as days sales in receivables and inventory turnover improved despite lower sales volume 
accounts receivable was million and million at may  and april   respectively 
days sales in receivables were days and days in fiscal and  respectively 
inventory was million at may  and million at april  inventory turnover was in fiscal and in fiscal our cash position also reflects cash outlays for capital expenditures of million  payments on vendor financed capital expenditures of million  and payments on a capital lease obligation of  in addition  the company paid million for the acquisition of the knitted mattress fabrics operation of bodet horst  which was financed through million in cash proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
the cash flow from operations and the sale of the corporate headquarters proceeds of million allowed us to substantially reduce total borrowings during fiscal during fiscal  we repaid million in long term debt  of which million related to principal payments due in march and june our long term debt balance was million and million at may  and april   respectively 
the long term debt balance of million includes an million unsecured term loan added in the second quarter of fiscal to finance the bodet horst acquisition 
also  our long term debt balance of million is unsecured with scheduled principal payments of million   and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
at may   we had unsecured revolving lines of credit of million and million in the us and china  respectively 
at may   there were no borrowings under these revolving credit lines 
at may   total debt current maturities of long term debt and long term debt  less current maturities less cash was million compared with million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal and million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal this decrease resulted from cash flow from operations and the sale of the company s corporate headquarters see section below 
our cash position may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control  such as weakening industry demand  delays in receipt of payment on accounts receivable  the availability of trade credit  and income tax payments in foreign jurisdictions china and canada that are paid in its local currency 
we expect cash flow generated from working capital reductions to be substantially lower in fiscal working capital accounts receivable as of may  decreased million or from april  days sales in receivables were days and days at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
these trends primarily reflect lower sales volume in fiscal compared with fiscal and customers associated with the mattress fabric segment taking advantage of cash discounts for early payments 
inventories at may   decreased million or from april  inventory turns for fiscal were versus for fiscal these trends primarily reflect lower sales volume in fiscal compared with fiscal and improved inventory management in fiscal accounts payable trade as of may  decreased million or from april  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in inventory purchases in fiscal operating working capital comprised of accounts receivable and inventories  less accounts payable was million at may   down from million at april  operating working capital turnover was in fiscal compared to in fiscal these trends primarily reflect the decreases in accounts receivable and inventory purchases noted above

as more fully disclosed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
at may   the company had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term 
the final outcome of these tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  legal proceedings  competent authority proceedings  changes in regulatory tax laws  or interpretations of those tax laws  or expiration of statutes of limitation 
as a result of these inherent uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of payment of these amounts 
of the million in total gross unrecognized tax benefits  million would not be subject to cash payments due to the company s us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
capital expenditures capital expenditures on an accrual and cash basis for fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the capital spending of million consisted of million for the mattress fabrics segment   for the upholstery fabrics segment  and  of unallocated corporate expense 
depreciation expense for fiscal was million  of which million relates to the mattress fabrics segment and million relates to the upholstery fabrics segment 
the million depreciation expense related to the upholstery fabrics segment includes million of incremental depreciation expense accelerated depreciation to reflect revised depreciation estimates and useful lives for certain fixed assets that were to be used over a shortened useful life from the period the september upholstery fabrics restructuring plan was announced until the respective plant facility was closed and operations ceased 
for fiscal  the company currently expects capital expenditures on an accrual and cash basis to be approximately million and million  respectively 
planned capital expenditures for fiscal primarily relate to the mattress fabrics segment 
for fiscal  depreciation expense is projected to be million 
expected depreciation expense for fiscal primarily relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
accounts payable capital expenditures the company s vendor financed arrangements on capital projects initiated prior to fiscal bear interest with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
the principal payment requirements of accounts payable capital expenditures during the next two fiscal years are  and  capital lease obligation in may  we entered into a capital lease to finance a portion of the construction of certain equipment related to our mattress fabrics segment 
the lease agreement contains a bargain purchase option and bears interest at 
the lease agreement requires total principal payments totaling million which commenced on july   and are being paid in quarterly installments through april this agreement is secured by equipment with a carrying value of million 
the remaining principal payments of  are due in quarterly installments in fiscal inflation any significant increase in our raw material costs  utility energy costs and general economic inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company  because competitive conditions have limited the company s ability to pass significant operating increases on to its customers 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of may   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and accounts receivable from bedding manufacturers totaled approximately million 
additionally  as of may   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
one customer within the upholstery fabrics segment represented of consolidated accounts receivable at may  no customers within the mattress fabrics segment represented more than of consolidated accounts receivable at may  we continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that we could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
the reserve balance for doubtful accounts was million and million at may  and april   respectively 
inventory valuation 
we operate as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the reserve for inventory markdowns was million and million at may  and april   respectively 
long lived assets 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes an impairment accounting model for long lived assets to be held and used  disposed of by sale  or disposed of by abandonment or other means 
management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
during fiscal  we incurred impairment charges on property  plant  and equipment in connection with our restructuring activities 
these impairment charges totaled million and were recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million impairment charge represents million for fixed assets that were abandoned in connection with the consolidation of certain plant facilities in china and  to reflect the selling price of our corporate headquarters of million 
also  during the course of our strategic review in the second quarter of fiscal of its upholstery fabric business  the company assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of its upholstery fabric fixed assets that were being held and used in operations 
this strategic review resulted in impairment losses of million and  for fixed assets held in china and the us  respectively 
in addition  the company  incurred impairment losses totaling  for assets held for sale associated with its us upholstery fabric operations 
these losses reflect the amounts by which the carrying values for these fixed assets exceeded their estimated fair values determined by their estimated future undiscounted cash flows and quoted market prices 
the determination of future operating cash flows involves considerable estimation and judgment about future market conditions  future sales and profitability  and future asset utilization 
although we believe it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions  or a decision to dispose of substantial portions of these assets  could result in materially different results 
goodwill 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill to no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment by comparing each reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
as of may  and april   our goodwill was million and million  respectively 
this increase is due to the acquisition of the knitted mattress fabric operation of bodet horst 
our goodwill balance relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
we engaged an independent valuation specialist to assist us with our goodwill impairment test as of may  for our mattress fabrics segment 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step approach  in which  we first estimate the fair market values our reporting units mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics using the present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to its market capitalization at the date of valuation 
the company uses a discount rate equal to its average cost of funds to discount the expected future cash flows 
if the fair market value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step the implied fair market value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair market value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds it implied fair market value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event that occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying values 
this impairment test did not indicate any impairment of goodwill for fiscal although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
restructuring charges 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas no 
 a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity must be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for certain employee termination benefits that qualify under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the upholstery fabric segment continues to be under significant pressure from a variety of external forces  such as the current consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and the growing competition from imported fabrics and cut and sewn kits 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses and scale us productive capacity in line with current and expected demand trends  we have undertaken restructuring initiatives during the past several years 
these restructuring initiatives have resulted in restructuring charges related to the remaining lease costs of the closed facilities  the write down of property  plant and equipment  workforce reduction and elimination of facilities 
severance and related charges are accrued at the date the restructuring is approved by the board of directors based on an estimate of amounts that will be paid to affected employees  in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 asset impairment charges related to the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities are based on an estimate of expected sales prices for the real estate and equipment 
other exit costs  which principally consist of charges for lease termination and losses from termination of existing contracts  equipment relocation costs and inventory markdowns that are related to the restructuring are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
we reassess the individual accrual requirements at the end of each reporting period 
if circumstances change  causing current estimates to differ from original estimates  adjustments are recorded in the period of change 
restructuring charges  and adjustments of those charges  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income tax exposure and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
at may   the company had net deferred tax assets totaling million 
this million represents net deferred tax assets for income tax jurisdictions located in the us  canada  and china 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded to reduce our net deferred tax assets located in the us and china 
management concluded that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture and mattresses  along with the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  has made it very difficult to forecast both short term and long term financial results  and therefore  present significant negative evidence as to whether we need to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on this significant negative evidence  we recorded a million valuation allowance during fiscal  of which million and million were against our net deferred tax assets of our us and china operations  respectively 
the company s net deferred tax asset primarily resulted from the recording of the income tax benefit of us income tax loss carryforwards over the last several years  which totals million 
this non cash charge of million has no effect on the company s operations  loan covenant compliance  or the possible utilization of the us income tax loss carryforwards in the future 
if and when the company utilizes any of the us income tax loss carryforwards to offset future us taxable income  the income tax benefit would be recognized at that time 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  fin on april  under fin we must recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as tax expense 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions and in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 
at may   the company had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements sfas nos 
and we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas for financial assets and liabilities and sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  on april  sfas creates a single definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure requirements about items measured at fair value 
sfas applies to both items recognized and reported at fair value in the financial statements and items disclosed at fair value in the notes to the financial statements 
sfas does not change existing accounting rules governing what can or what must be recognized and reported at fair value in the company s financial statements  or disclosed at fair value in our notes to the financial statements 
additionally  sfas does not eliminate practicability exceptions that exist in accounting pronouncements amended by sfas when measuring fair value 
as a result  we will not be required to recognize any new assets or liabilities at fair value 
prior to sfas  certain measurements of fair value were based on the price that would be paid to acquire an asset  or received to assume a liability an entry price 
sfas clarifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date that is  an exit price 
the exit price is based on the amount that the holder of the asset or liability would receive or need to pay in an actual transaction or in a hypothetical transaction if an actual transaction does not exist at the measurement date 
in some circumstances  the entry and exit price may be the same  however  they are conceptually different 
fair value is generally determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if quoted market prices are not available  the company uses valuation techniques that place greater reliance on observable inputs and less reliance on unobservable inputs 
in measuring fair value  the company may make adjustments for risks and uncertainties  if a market participant would include such an adjustment in its pricing 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and the company s assumptions unobservable inputs 
determining where an asset or liability falls within that hierarchy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair measurement as a whole 
an adjustment to the pricing method used within either level or level inputs could generate a fair value measurement that effectively falls in a lower level in the hierarchy 
the hierarchy consists of three broad levels as follows level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than level inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level unobservable inputs developed using the company s estimates and assumptions  which reflect those that market participants would use 
the following table presents information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value measurements at may  using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets significant other observable inputs significant unobservable inputs amounts in thousands level level level total assets canadian dollar fx contract not applicable not applicable liabilities none not applicable not applicable not applicable not applicable as shown above  the canadian foreign exchange contract derivative instrument is valued based on fair value provided by the company s bank and is classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment 
the company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter based on various factors and it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter 
however  we expect that changes in classifications between different levels will be rare 
most derivative contracts are not listed on an exchange and require the use of valuation models 
consistent with sfas  the company attempts to maximize the use of observable market inputs in its models 
when observable inputs are not available  the company defaults to unobservable inputs 
derivatives valued based on models with significant unobservable inputs and that are not actively traded  or trade activity is one way  are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
some financial statement preparers have reported difficulties in applying sfas to certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  particularly those acquired in business combinations and those requiring a determination of impairment 
to allow the time to consider the effects of the implementation issues that have arisen  the fasb issued fsp fas fsp on february  to provide a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
as a result of fsp  we have not yet adopted sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a non recurring basis 
fsp is effective for the company in fiscal and the company is evaluating the impact that the application of sfas to those nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have on its financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas provides the company with an option to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for most financial assets and liabilities and certain other items 
the fair value option election is applied on an instrument by instrument basis with some exceptions  is irrevocable  and is applied to an entire instrument 
the election may be made as of the date of initial adoption for existing eligible items 
subsequent to initial adoption  the company may elect the fair value option at initial recognition of eligible items  on entering into an eligible firm commitment  or when certain specified reconsideration events occur 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
upon adoption of sfas on april   we did not elect to account for any assets and liabilities under the scope of sfas at fair value
