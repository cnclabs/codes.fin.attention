critical accounting estimates the company s accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized in note to those statements 
certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the company s financial results because they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
financial instruments and fair value financial instruments securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased  investments and derivative contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period 
the company s other financial instruments are generally short term in nature or have variable interest rates and as such their carrying values approximate fair value  with the exception of notes receivable from employees which are carried at cost 
financial instruments used for asset and liability management the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk of its variable rate senior secured credit note 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the fair value of the swap hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the interest payments due to changes in the month london interbank offering rate libor 
fair value measurements effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy  and expands fair value measurement disclosures 
fair value  as defined by sfas  is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value hierarchy established by sfas prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three categories highest to lowest priority level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs the company s financial instruments are recorded at fair value and generally are classified within level or level within the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices or quotes from market makers or broker dealers 
financial instruments classified within level are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets and consist of us government  federal agency  and sovereign government obligations  corporate equities  and certain money market instruments 
level financial instruments primarily consist of investment grade and high yield corporate debt  convertible bonds  mortgage and asset backed securities  municipal obligations  and certain money market instruments 
financial instruments classified as level are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are n ot active 
some financial instruments are classified within level within the fair value hierarchy as observable pricing inputs are not available due to limited market activity for the asset or liability 
such financial instruments include investments in hedge funds and private equity funds where the company is general partner  less liquid private label mortgage and asset backed securities  and auction rate securities 
a description of the valuation techniques applied and inputs used in measuring the fair value of the company s financial instruments is located in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value option the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 effective january  sfas provides entities the option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period 
sfas permits the fair value option election on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument 
the company has elected to apply the fair value option to its loan trading portfolio which resides in the newly formed entity  opy credit corp 
management has elected this treatment as it is consistent with the manner in which the business is managed as well the way that financial instruments in other parts of the business are recorded 
there were no loan positions held in the secondary loan trading portfolio during the year ended december  loans and allowances for doubtful accounts customer receivables  primarily consisting of margin loans collateralized by customer owned securities  are charged interest at rates similar to other such loans made throughout the industry 
customer receivables are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts from customers 
the company reviews large customer accounts that do not comply with the company s margin requirements on a case by case basis to determine the likelihood of collection and records an allowance for doubtful accounts following that process 
for small customer accounts that do not comply with the company s margin requirements  the allowance for doubtful accounts is generally recorded as the amount of unsecured or partially secured receivables 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors as part of its hiring process 
reserves are established on these receivables if the financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and the receivable has not been promptly repaid or if it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
legal and regulatory reserves the company records reserves related to legal and regulatory proceedings in accounts payable and other liabilities 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  specifically in the case of client litigation  the amount of the loss in the client s account and the possibility of wrongdoing  if any  on the part of an employee of the company  the basis and validity of the claim  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law as well as the timing of the resolution of such matters 
each legal and regulatory proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount i s recorded in the results of that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal or regulatory proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount 
goodwill the company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units and the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill arose upon the acquisitions of oppenheimer  old michigan corp  josephthal co 
inc  grand charter group incorporated and the oppenheimer divisions as defined below 
the company defines a reporting unit as an operating segment 
the company s goodwill resides in its private client division pcd 
goodwill of a reporting unit is subject to at least an annual test for impairment to determine if the fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying amount 
the company derives the estimated carrying amount of its operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each operating segment 
sfas requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all financial asset classes and by a significant lack of liquidity 
the company s stock price  consistent with stock prices in the broader financial services sector  declined significantly during this period of time 
beginning in june  the company s market capitalization fell below recorded book value on a consistent basis which continued through the end of the year 
due to the significant discount between the market capitalization and book value  the company viewed this discount as a triggering event to performing an interim goodwill impairment test under sfas as a result  the company performed an impairment analysis between annual tests as of september  and also performed its annual test for goodwill impairment as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  appea ring in item excess of fair value of assets acquired over cost arose from the acquisition of the new capital markets businesses 
if the earn out from the acquisition of the new capital markets businesses see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  appearing in item exceeds million in any of the five years from through  the excess will first reduce the excess of fair value of acquired assets over cost and second will create goodwill  as applicable 
intangible assets intangible assets arose upon the acquisition  in january  of the us private client and asset management divisions of cibc world markets inc the oppenheimer divisions and are comprised of customer relationships and trademarks and trade names 
customer relationships are carried at  which is net of accumulated amortization of million and are being amortized on a straight line basis over months commencing in january trademarks and trade names  carried at million  which are not amortized  are subject to at least an annual test for impairment to determine if the fair value is less than their carrying amount 
intangible assets also arose from the acquisition of the new capital markets businesses in january and are comprised of customer relationships and a below market lease 
customer relationships are carried at  which is net of accumulated amortization of  and are being amortized on a straight line basis over months commencing in january the below market lease is carried at million which is net of accumulated amortization of million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over months commencing in january trademarks and trade names recorded as at december  have been tested for impairment and it has been determined that no impairment has occurred 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  appearing in item share based compensation plans the company estimates the fair value of share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model and applies to it a forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of share based awards include the expected term and the expected volatility of the company s class a shares over the term of the award  the risk free interest rate over the expected term  and the company s expected annual dividend yield 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive share based awards 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax balances are determined by applying the enacted tax rates applicable to the periods in which items will reverse 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no

business environment the securities industry is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including fluctuations in volume and price levels of securities and changes in interest rates  inflation  political events  investor participation levels  legal and regulatory  accounting  tax and compliance requirements and competition  all of which have an impact on commissions  firm trading  fees from accounts under investment management as well as fees for investment banking services  and investment income as well as on liquidity 
substantial fluctuations can occur in revenues and net income due to these and other factors 
fiscal was the most difficult economic environment in over years 
it began with a period of substantially increasing commodity prices and a weakening us dollar during the first six months and ended with a complete reversal of each of these trends amid falling home prices  seized credit markets  failing financial institutions  weakening economic activity and increasing unemployment as economists recognized the presence of the longest period of recession in the post war period 
intervention in the credit markets by the us treasury and the us federal deposit insurance corporation fdic through their support of commercial and investment banks as well as fannie mae and freddie mac and the prompt reduction of interest rates by the federal reserve to the lowest levels in history failed to staunch the lack of confidence brought on by illiquid markets and a falling economy 
interest rate changes impact the company s fixed income businesses as well as its cost of borrowed funds 
as a result of the federal reserve s reductions in the federal funds target rate  average interest rates were lower for the year ended december  compared to management constantly monitors its exposure to interest rate fluctuations to mitigate risk of loss in volatile environments 
it is anticipated that these and other issues will continue to affect the health and activity levels in the leveraged loan market and thus will affect merger and acquisition activity  and security issuance as well as significantly hamper investment banking activity and thus negatively impact the business of the company and its recent acquisition described below 
as previously reported  the company s results were impacted throughout the year by its acquisition on january  of the new capital markets business 
the new capital markets business including operations in the united kingdom  hong kong and israel were combined with the company s existing investment banking  corporate syndicate  institutional sales and trading and equities research divisions to form the capital markets division oib division 
the company did not foresee in the extremely challenging environment that would develop during when it determined to expand its existing capital markets business 
agreements made for compensation to former employees of cibc world markets as well as payments made to cibc during the transition of the acquired businesses to the company s platform substantially and negatively impacted the company s financial results throughout the year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item as previously reported  the company is not involved in the sub prime mortgage business  and does not have any exposure to that business as a result of its recent acquisition or otherwise 
for a number of years  the company has offered auction rate securities ars to its clients 
a significant portion of the market in auction rate securities has failed because  in the current tight credit market  the dealers are no longer willing or able to purchase the imbalance between supply and demand for auction rate securities 
these securities have auctions scheduled on either a  or day cycle 
clients of the company own a significant amount of ars in their individual accounts 
the absence of a liquid market for these securities presents a significant problem to clients and  as a result  to the company 
it should be noted that this is a failure of liquidity and not a default 
these securities in almost all cases have not failed to pay interest or principal when due 
these securities are fully collateralized for the most part and  for the most part  remain good credits 
the company has not acted as an auction agent for auction rate securities nor does it have a significant exposure in its proprietary accounts 
recently  some of these auction rate securities have been redeemed at par of issue value plus accrued dividends by their issuers thus reducing the scope of the issue for clients and the company 
however  in excess of fifty percent of the overall ars issued into the ars market remain outstanding 
there is no way to predict the pace of future redemptions or whether all of these securities will be redeemed by their issuers 
there has been pressure by regulators for financial services firms to redeem ars held by clients 
settlements with regulators by our competitors have created inconsistencies in the treatment between firms that are redeeming ars from clients with their own funds and firms  like the company  which have yet to do so 
the company continues to review this situation and explore options to help bring liquidity to the company s clients holding ars 
the company is reviewing various programs initiated by the us government to restore liquidity to the markets 
the company has taken or is considering taking various actions to facilitate the purchase of client held ars including filing an amendment to the charter of oppenheimer trust company to become a depository bank eligible for fdic insurance as well as to obtain access to the us federal reserve discount window  filing an application with the fdic for oppenheimer trust company to obtain deposit insurance  and filing applications on behalf of oppenheimer trust company and oppenheimer holdings to participate in the us treasury capital purchase program 
the company believes that one or more of these programs might lead to a solution to bring liquidity to client held ars 
in additi on  the company is considering applying to become a bank holding company 
the company has been reviewing its charter with a view to moving the situs of the company to the united states in order to  among other things  potentially avail itself of various programs sponsored by the us treasury and the fdic which may be available only to us based companies 
the company believes that one or more of these programs might under certain circumstances provide the liquidity necessary to permit the company to redeem ars from its clients 
see risk factors the company may be adversely affected by the failure of the auction rate securities market and factors affecting forward looking statements 
the company is focused on growing its private client and asset management businesses through strategic additions of experienced financial advisors in its existing branch system and employment of experienced money management personnel in its asset management business 
in addition  the company is committed to the improvement of its technology capability to support client service and the expansion of its capital markets capabilities while addressing the issue of managing its expenses to better align them with the current investment environment 
regulatory environment the brokerage business is subject to regulation by  among others  the sec and finra formerly the nyse and nasd in the united states  the financial services authority fsa in the united kingdom  the israeli securities authority isa in israel and various state securities regulators 
events in recent years surrounding corporate accounting and other activities leading to investor losses resulted in the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act and have caused increased regulation of public companies 
new regulations and new interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations are creating increased costs of compliance and increased investment in systems and procedures to comply with these more complex and onerous requirements 
increasingly  the various states are imposing their own regulations that make the uniformity of regulation a thing of the past  and make compliance more difficult and more exp ensive to monitor 
finra has recently completed the unification and codification of its legacy nyse and nasd rules 
recent events connected to the worldwide credit crisis has made it highly likely the self regulatory framework for financial institutions will be changed in the united states and around the world 
the changes are likely to significantly reduce leverage available to financial institutions and increase transparency to regulators and investors of risks taken by such institutions 
it is impossible to presently predict the nature of such rulemaking  but when enacted such regulations will likely reduce returns earned by financial service providers 
the impact of the rules and requirements that were created by the passage of the patriot act  and the anti money laundering regulations aml in the us and similar laws in other countries that are related thereto have created significant costs of compliance and can be expected to continue to do so 
intervention by governments and monetary authorities around the world as a result of the current credit market dislocations will most likely result in new regulations around the world that will significantly reduce the availability of leverage to the balance sheets of financial institutions 
it is impossible to predict the impact or costs associated with these yet to be announced programs and regulations 
pursuant to finra rule formerly nasd rule and nyse rule  the chief executive officers ceos of regulated broker dealers including the ceo of oppenheimer are required to certify that their companies have processes in place to establish and test policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with federal securities laws and regulations  including applicable regulations of self regulatory organizations 
the ceo of the company is required to make such a certification on an annual basis and did so on march  other regulatory matters on july   the financial industry regulatory authority finra issued a notice of acceptance accepting a settlement of the previously reported investigation into oppenheimer s securities lending practices 
the investigation concerned oppenheimer s supervision of its securities lending activities including  but not limited to  failing to detect and prevent stock loan personnel from engaging in business dealings with finders in violation of oppenheimer policy 
pursuant to the notice of acceptance  oppenheimer  without admitting or denying any allegations  agreed to a censure and the payment of a fine in the amount of on april   oppenheimer received an invitation from the sec to make a wells submission with respect to its activities as a broker dealer in connection with oppenheimer s supervision of a former retail financial advisor s dealings with a single institutional customer and the commissions earned with respect thereto 
the company believes that the activity alleged was not inappropriate and that the customer was a sophisticated institution capable of evaluating commissions charged for services rendered 
oppenheimer is in discussions with the sec to resolve this matter 
there is no guarantee the matter will be settled 
oppenheimer has been responding to the sec  finra and several state regulators as part of an industry wide review of the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ars 
the company has answered several document requests and subpoenas and there have been on the record interviews of company personnel 
the company is continuing to cooperate with the investigating entities 
on november  the massachusetts securities division filed an administrative complaint the complaint  captioned in the matter of oppenheimer co 
inc  albert lowenthal  robert lowenthal and greg white  docket no 
 alleging violations of the massachusetts general law  the massachusetts uniform securities act and regulations thereunder with respect to the sale by oppenheimer of ars to its clients 
the complaint alleges  inter alia  that oppenheimer improperly misrepresented the nature o f ars and the overall stability and health of the ars market 
the complaint also alleges that key oppenheimer executives and auction rate department personnel sold their personal ars holdings while in possession of information that the entire ars market was in danger of failing and that those individuals failed to disclose this information to investors 
the massachusetts securities division seeks various relief including an order requiring oppenheimer to offer rescission of sales of ars at par and requiring oppenheimer to make full restitution to investors who have already sold their ars below par 
the division also seeks an order revoking the chairman of oppenheimer s massachusetts registration as a broker dealer agent and requiring oppenheimer and the named executives and other personnel to pay an administrative fine in an amount to be determined 
oppenheimer and all individual respondents have filed an answer to the complaint denying that the allegations in the compliant have any basis in fact or law 
all respondents intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in the complaint 
see risk factors the company may be adversely affected by the failure of the auction rate securities market 
other matters a subsidiary of the company was the administrative agent for two closed end funds until december  the company has been advised by the current administrative agent for these two funds that the internal revenue service may file a claim for interest and penalties for one of these funds with respect to the tax year as a result of an alleged failure of such subsidiary to take certain actions 
the company will continue to monitor developments in this matter 
the company operates in all state jurisdictions in the united states and is thus subject to regulation and enforcement under the laws and regulations of each of these jurisdictions 
the company has been and expects that it will continue to be subject to investigations and some or all of these may result in enforcement proceedings as a result of its business conducted in the various states 
as part of its ongoing business  the company records reserves for legal expenses  judgments  fines and or awards attributable to litigation and regulatory matters 
in connection therewith  the company has maintained its legal reserves at levels it believes will resolve outstanding matters  but may increase or decrease such reserves as matters warrant 
business continuity the company is committed to an on going investment in its technology and communications infrastructure including extensive business continuity planning and investment 
these costs are on going and the company believes that current and future costs will exceed historic levels due to business and regulatory requirements 
this investment has increased over the last several quarters as a result of the acquisition of the new capital markets businesses from cibc and the company s need to build out its platform to accommodate this business 
the company successfully transitioned these businesses to its platform in the third quarter of outlook the company s long term plan is to continue to expand existing offices by hiring experienced professionals as well as through the purchase of operating branch offices from other broker dealers or the opening of new branch offices in attractive locations  thus maximizing the potential of each office and the development of existing trading  investment banking  investment advisory and other activities 
equally important is the search for viable acquisition candidates 
as opportunities are presented  it is the long term intention of the company to pursue growth by acquisition where a comfortable match can be found in terms of corporate goals and personnel and at a price that would provide the company s shareholders with incremental value 
the company acquired on january   the new capital markets business described under item  business 
the company may review additional potential acquisition opportunities  and will continue to focus its attention on the management of its existing business 
in addition  the company is committed to improving its technology capabilities to support client service and the expansion of its capital markets capabilities 
results of operations the net loss for the year ended december  was million or per share  compared to net profit of million or per share in the same period of revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in  an increase of 
the turmoil in the financial markets during substantially impacted all of the company s businesses resulting in flat revenues 
the company incurred significantly increased expenses associated with the acquisition of a major part of cibc world markets us capital markets businesses in january the company s results were impacted considerably by a decrease in performance fees associated with investments in various alternative investments where the company serves as the general partner 
the year ended december  was the most difficult year in the company s history measured by net profit and earnings per share 
the company s acquisition of the new capital markets business from cibc affected results adversely throughout the year 
while the assumptions made by the company in making the decision to purchase the new capital markets business in were based on a reduced capital markets environment  the reality proved significantly more problematic as the costs built into the transaction affected financial results by approximately million in fiscal through expenditures on transition costs  for personnel and for the support of systems 
markets were weak throughout the year  producing disappointing revenues particularly through weak investment banking fees and limited fee based leveraged finance revenues 
transactional business from both private client and capital markets and fees from fee based programs held up somewhat better but came in below the levels of the prior year after adjusting for the addition of the new capital markets business 
interest income for was impacted by lower rates on lower customer debit balances and substantially decreased activity in the securities lending business 
performance fees associated with the company s management of alternative investments did not make a signifi cant contribution to the company s results in fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of revenues for the oib division  million for the year ended december   were substantially less approximately  than the comparable fiscal period last year on a pro forma combined basis  due to significantly reduced investment banking activity 
as previously reported  the results of the oib division will be tracked for the five years following the acquisition for purposes of determining payments that may be due to cibc as part of the acquisition price 
the following table sets forth the amount and percentage of the company s revenue from each principal source for each of the following years ended december amounts are expressed in thousands of dollars 
commissions principal transactions  net interest investment banking advisory fees other total revenue the company derives most of its revenue from the operations of its principal subsidiaries  oppenheimer and oam 
although maintained as separate entities  the operations of the company s brokerage subsidiaries both in the us and other countries are closely related because oppenheimer acts as clearing broker and omnibus clearing agent in transactions initiated by these subsidiaries 
except as expressly otherwise stated  the discussion below pertains to the operations of oppenheimer 
the following table and discussion summarizes the changes in the major revenue and expense categories for the past two years 
amounts are expressed in thousands of dollars

commissions for the year ended december  increased compared to the same period in primarily as a result of the acquired businesses 
for the year ended december   of total commissions were generated by the oib division s institutional equity business  representing an increase of million compared to the same period in this increase was offset by a decline of million in commissions generated by the company s other commission generating businesses 
principal transactions  net decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to losses in convertible bond arbitrage and failed hedging strategies as the prices of us treasuries diverged from the rest of the credit market during the difficult market conditions experienced in the third and fourth quarters of investment banking revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in despite the expansion of the company s investment banking presence as a result of the acquisition in january  market conditions were not conducive to activities generating investment banking revenue 
advisory fees decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in declining market values of client assets negatively impacted fee levels in the third and fourth quarters of assets under management decreased to billion at december  compared to billion at december   as a result of declining market values of client fee paying accounts associated with the general decline in securities markets 
in addition  performance fees earned as a result of participation as a general partner in various alternative investments amounted to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal due to generally disappointing investment results compared to the prior year

see item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company s principal business activities by their nature involve significant market  credit and other risks 
the company s effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability 
as part of its normal business operations  the company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market making capacity 
the company makes markets in over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers 
the company also makes markets in municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  government bonds and high yield bonds and short term fixed income securities and loans issued by various corporations 
market risk 
market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
oppenheimer monitors market risks through daily profit and loss statements and position reports 
each trading department adheres to internal position limits determined by senior management and regularly reviews the age and composition of its proprietary accounts 
positions and profits and losses for each trading department are reported to senior management on a daily basis 
in its market making activities  oppenheimer must provide liquidity in the equities for which it makes markets 
as a result of this  oppenheimer has risk containment policies in place  which limit position size and monitor transactions on a minute to minute basis 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by the company fails to perform its contractual obligations 
given the problems in the credit markets that occurred in and continue currently  there has been an increased focus in the industry about credit risk 
the company follows industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral wherever possible 
the company adjusts margin requirements if it believes the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
when oppenheimer advances funds or securities to a counterparty in a principal transaction or to a customer in a brokered transaction  it is subject to the risk that the counterparty or customer will not repay such advances 
if the market price of the securities purc hased or loaned has declined or increased  respectively  oppenheimer may be unable to recover some or all of the value of the amount advanced 
a similar risk is also present where a customer is unable to respond to a margin call and the market price of the collateral has dropped 
in addition  oppenheimer s securities positions are subject to fluctuations in market value and liquidity 
in addition to monitoring the credit worthiness of its customers  oppenheimer imposes more conservative margin requirements than those of the nyse 
generally  oppenheimer limits customer loans to an amount not greater than of the value of the securities or if the securities in the account are concentrated in a limited number of issues 
particular attention and more restrictive requirements are placed on more highly volatile securities traded in the nasdaq market 
in comparison  the nyse permits loans of up to of the value of the equity securities in a customer s account 
further discussion of credit risk appears in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included in item operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in its operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in its internal control processes 
the company operates in diverse markets and it is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems  human error or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance policies and procedures including the maintenance of disaster recovery facilities and procedures related thereto that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
with respect to its trading activities  the company has procedures designed to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected on the company s books on a timely basis 
with respect to client activities  the company operates a system of internal controls designed to ensure that transactions and other account activity new account solicitation  transaction authorization  transaction processing  billing and collection are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled 
the company has procedures designed to assess and monitor counterparty risk 
for details of funding risk  see item  under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
legal and regulatory risk 
legal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  client claims and the possibility of sizeable adverse legal judgments 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its activities 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly intense over the past few years and the company  as well as others in the industry  has been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny 
timely and accurate compliance with regulatory requests has become increasingly problematic  and regulators have tended to bring enforcement proceedings in relation to such matters 
see further discussion in item  under the caption regulatory environment 
the company has comprehensive procedures for addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  granting of credit  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
the company has designated anti money laundering compliance officers who monitor compliance with regulations under the us patriot act 
see further discussion on the company s reserve policy in item  under the caption critical accounting estimates  item  legal proceedings and item  regulation 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in certain limited instances  the company utilizes off balance sheet arrangements to manage risk 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements in item value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the sec s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading of financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows in thousands of dollars var for fiscal var for fiscal high low average high low average equity price risk interest rate risk commodity price risk diversification benefit total var at december  equity price risk interest rate risk commodity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio at december  compared to december  the company s portfolio as at december  includes approximately million million in in corporate equities  which are related to deferred compensation liabilities and which do not bear any value at risk to the company 
the company used derivative financial instruments to hedge market risk in fiscal and  including in connection with the senior secured credit note  which is described in note of the notes to the consolid ated financial statements  appearing in item such information is hereby incorporated by reference 
further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item a  risk factors 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions  including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions 
likewise  the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
