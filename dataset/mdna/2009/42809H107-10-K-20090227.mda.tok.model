consolidated results of operations the after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below millions of dollars  except per share data exploration and production marketing and refining corporate interest expense net income net income per share diluted in the discussion that follows  the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis 
management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings 
management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings  since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount 
after tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts 
the following table summarizes  on an after tax basis  items of income expense that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods 
the items in the table below are explained  and the pre tax amounts are shown  on pages through millions of dollars exploration and production marketing and refining corporate

risk factors related to our business and operations 
accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement 
the accounting methods used can affect net income  stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios 
however  the corporation s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 
accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage  including lease bonuses  brokers fees and other related costs  are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  including development dry holes  and related production facilities are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
if either of those criteria is not met  or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project  the 
table of contents capitalized well costs are charged to expense 
indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel  active negotiations for sales contracts with customers  negotiations with governments  operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities 
the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations  the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment  as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
the corporation s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board 
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible  government and project operator approvals must be obtained and  depending on the amount of the project cost  senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project 
the corporation s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves 
the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties 
the corporation s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells  performance reviews  new technical data and other studies 
to provide consistency throughout the corporation  standard reserve estimation guidelines  definitions  reporting reviews and approval practices are used 
the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review 
the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas disclosures about oil and gas producing activities fas are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton d m and are consistent with internal estimates 
annually  the corporation provides d m with engineering  geological and geophysical data  actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination 
the corporation s and d m s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided 
senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by d m 
on december   the securities and exchange commission published a final rule which revises its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements 
the revisions are effective for filings on form k for fiscal years ending december  the corporation is evaluating the impact of these requirements on its oil and gas reserve estimates and disclosures 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing 
the corporation reviews long lived assets  including oil and gas fields  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates  the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded 
the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 
in the case of oil and gas fields  the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices  which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices  applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate  the projected production volumes represent reserves  including probable reserves  expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 
the production volumes  prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information 
oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 
the corporation s impairment tests of long lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors  selling prices  operating and capital costs  the timing of future production and other factors  which are updated each time an impairment test is performed 
the 
table of contents corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease  crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 
in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the corporation s goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level  which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
the impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
the corporation s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 
the corporation s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments  the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets  and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings  access to new business opportunities  enterprise control  improved processes and increased market share 
the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 
the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves  future prices  timing of future net cash flows and market premiums 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing  there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 
asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to measure these obligations  the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations 
in determining these estimates  the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement  timing of settlement  interpretation of legal requirements  inflationary factors and discount rate 
in addition  there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements  fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates  and advances in technology 
as a result  the corporation s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above 
changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 
derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non trading and trading activities 
in non trading activities  the corporation uses futures  forwards  options and swaps  individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined products and electricity  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in trading activities  the corporation  principally through a consolidated partnership  trades energy commodities and derivatives  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  based on expectations of future market conditions 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation s balance sheet 
the corporation s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair 
table of contents value hedges 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting 
the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models  which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 
fair value measurements the corporation s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are carried at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period 
in determining fair value  the corporation uses various valuation approaches  including the market and income approaches 
the corporation s fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations 
counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances  and the corporation s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 
the corporation adopted the provisions of fas  fair value measurements fas  effective january  fas establishes a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input  which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level to estimates determined using related market data level 
multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value  however  the level of fair value for each financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 
details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are as follows fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded 
closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value 
market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity 
the fair value of certain of the corporation s exchange traded futures and options are considered level in addition  fair values for the majority of the corporation s supplemental pension plan investments are considered level  since they are determined using quotations from national securities exchanges 
fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level measurements based on level inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve  but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts 
the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level inputs for certain forwards  swaps and options 
the liability related to the corporation s crude oil hedges is classified as level fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data  determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations 
for example  in its energy marketing business  the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts 
the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations  which are classified as level income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
these judgements include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not  that based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained upon examination 

table of contents the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions  including the united states  and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits 
additionally  the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities 
regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized 
if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets  the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences  available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards  estimates of future taxable income  the availability of tax planning strategies  the existence of appreciated assets and other factors 
estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation s internal business forecasts 
the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
retirement plans the corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan 
in accordance with fas  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas  the corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 
the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  and rate of future increases in compensation levels 
these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation  some of which can be affected by external factors 
for example  the discount rate used to estimate the corporation s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations  while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category  weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
changes in accounting policies as discussed on page  the corporation adopted fas effective january  the impact of adopting fas was not material to the corporation s results of operations 
upon adoption  the corporation recorded a reduction in the net deferred hedge losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  which increased stockholders equity by million  after income taxes 
effective december   the corporation applied the provisions of emerging issues task force  issuer s accounting for liabilities measured at fair value with a third party credit enhancement eitf 
upon adoption  the corporation revalued certain derivative liabilities collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the corporation s credit rating rather than the credit rating of the issuing bank 
the adoption resulted in an increase in sales and other operating revenues of approximately million and an increase in other comprehensive income of approximately million  with a corresponding decrease in derivative liabilities recorded within accounts payable 
recently issued accounting standard in december  the fasb issued fas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary 
the corporation will adopt the provisions of fas effective january  and estimates that adoption will result in a decrease in other long term liabilities and an increase in stockholders equity of approximately million 
environment  health and safety the corporation has implemented a values based  socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment  health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities 
the strategy is supported by the corporation s environment  health  safety and social responsibility ehs sr policies and by 
table of contents environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation s workforce  customers and local communities 
the corporation s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency  adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs sr performance 
improved performance may  in the short term  increase the corporation s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets  reputation and license to operate 
in addition to enhanced ehs sr performance  improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in ehs sr 
the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance  audit facilities  train employees  prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs sr goals 
the corporation and hovensa produce and the corporation distributes fuel oils in the united states 
proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils 
if adopted  these proposals could require capital expenditures by the registrant and hovensa to meet the required sulfur content standards 
as described in item legal proceedings  in the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa s petroleum refining initiative pri 
the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries 
since  the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control nearly of the domestic refining capacity 
negotiations with the epa are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the corporation and hovensa 
while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court  additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over a number of years 
the amount of penalties  if any  is not expected to be material to the corporation 
the corporation has undertaken a program to assess  monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane 
the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern with potentially significant consequences for society and the energy industry 
the corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is developing and implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions 
the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation 
sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations  terminals  onshore exploration and production facilities  refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and  although not currently significant  superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 
the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
at year end  the corporation s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately million 
the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites 
the corporation s remediation spending was million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for facilities  primarily to comply with federal  state and local environmental standards  other than for the low sulfur requirements  were million in and million in and forward looking information certain sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  including references to the corporation s future results of operations and financial position  liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures  oil and gas production  tax rates  debt repayment  hedging  derivative  market risk and environmental disclosures  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information 
forward looking disclosures are based on the corporation s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future 
actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions  government actions and other factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of its business  the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil  natural gas  refined products and electricity  as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values 
in the disclosures that follow  these operations are referred to as non trading activities 
the corporation also has trading operations  principally through a voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities 
these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil  natural gas and refined products 
the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 
controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy  which the corporation s senior management has approved 
controls include volumetric  term and value at risk limits 
in addition  the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities 
risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management 
the corporation s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models 
these controls apply to all of the corporation s non trading and trading activities  including the consolidated trading partnership 
the corporation s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 
instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts  foreign exchange forward contracts  futures  swaps  options and energy commodity based securities in its non trading and trading activities 
these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms 
the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them forward commodity contracts the corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities 
at settlement date  the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity 
forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under fas are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures 
forward foreign exchange contracts the corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the british pound  the norwegian krone  and the danish krone  which commit the corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date 
exchange traded contracts the corporation uses exchange traded contracts  including futures  on a number of different underlying energy commodities 
these contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits 
swaps the corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities 
cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract 
options options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods 
as a seller of options  the corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option 
as a purchaser of options  the corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities 
these premiums are a component of the fair value of the options 
energy securities energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities 

table of contents value at risk the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non trading activities 
the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a confidence level 
the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options 
the following table summarizes the value at risk results for trading and non trading activities 
these results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non trading activities 
trading non trading activities activities millions of dollars at december average high low at december average high low non trading the corporation s non trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production 
futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the corporation s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the corporation s selling prices
