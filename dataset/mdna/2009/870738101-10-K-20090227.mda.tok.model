item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december    and included with this report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company formed in  and we are engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and natural gas properties  with a focus on our reserves and production from the inland waters of louisiana and from our onshore louisiana and texas properties 
we are the largest producer of crude oil in the state of louisiana  and due to increasing emphasis on our south louisiana operations  we have become predominantly an oil producer  with oil constituting of our domestic production  and oil and natural gas liquids ngls together making up of our domestic production 
this emphasis has allowed us to benefit from better margins for oil production than natural gas production in unless otherwise noted  both historical information for all periods and forward looking information provided in this management s discussion and analysis relates solely to our continuing operations located in the united states  and excludes our discontinued new zealand operations 
actions taken in response to the credit crisis and downturn in the industry recent extreme volatility in worldwide credit and financial markets  combined with rapidly falling prices for oil and natural gas  all of which began late in the third quarter of  will have a significant impact on our cash flow  capital expenditures  and liquidity in future periods 
oil and natural gas prices continued to decline during the fourth quarter of  leading to a decline in average prices per boe received when compared to average prices received in the third quarter of these declines reduced our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and given further price declines in early  will continue to reduce our cash flow from operations in future periods in which prices remain at these lower levels 
the company has taken several steps to manage the decline in expected cash flow in and provide liquidity in future periods including reduced budgeted capital expenditures 
we have reduced our capital expenditures budget to a range of million to million  which we expect to be in line with our expected cash flows from operating activities for released all drilling rigs in early as we have limited drilling activities in our reduced capital expenditures budget we will begin drilling again as drilling costs decrease and become more in line with the current oil and gas pricing environment 
reduced our workforce 
in early  we reduced our headcount to lower general and administrative costs in future periods  although the first quarter of effect will be minimal given severance and other associated costs 
adjusted operations 
we have adjusted our operations and facility usage to levels which will reduce lease operating expense in and future periods 
reviewed the credit worthiness of customers 
given the downturn in the industry we have examined every one of our purchasers of oil and gas for credit worthiness and we believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the size  reputation  and nature of the companies to which we extend credit 
we also obtain letters of credit or parent company guaranties from certain customers  if applicable  to reduce risk of loss 
reviewed the banks in our line of credit facility 
in light of recent credit market volatility  many financial institutions have experienced liquidity issues  and governments have intervened in these markets to create liquidity  and provide capital 
we have reviewed the credit worthiness of the banks that fund our credit facility and thus far the liquidity of our banks has not been impacted 
monitored our debt covenants 
our revolving credit facility includes requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of these agreements and expect to remain in compliance with these provisions in and future periods 
financial condition in the fourth quarter of  as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
our debt to capitalization ratio increased to at december   as compared to at year end  as total equity and retained earnings decreased as a result of the year end non cash write down of our oil and gas properties 
our debt to pv ratio increased to at december  from at year end  primarily due to lower period end prices used in the reserves calculation 
operating results in our continuing operations we had record cash flow  with cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations increasing over amounts to million 
we also had record revenues of million for  an increase of over comparable levels 
our weighted average sales price received increased to per boe for from in our million  or  increase in revenues resulted from higher oil and gas prices during  offset slightly by the decrease in production 
income loss from continuing operations decreased to a loss of million compared to amounts 
production decreased to mmboe as a result of production shut ins necessitated by hurricanes gustav and then ike 
additionally  the effects of the hurricanes were felt through the third and fourth quarters as the drilling and completion of several wells were delayed as we moved drilling rigs into safe harbor before the hurricanes and then returned them to the field afterwards 
hurricane gustav shut down procedures were implemented in the third quarter in our lake washington field and south louisiana core area  with some damage  while bay de chene field experienced significant damage to its production facilities  and some production equipment in the field was damaged or destroyed 
hurricane ike in mid september caused damage to several fields in our south louisiana core area and our high island field due to high water levels 
as a result of these hurricanes  approximately mmboe of production was shut in during the third quarter of  and approximately mmboe of production was shut in for the fourth quarter of by october   production in our lake washington field had returned to of pre storm levels and all operated production had been restored in our south louisiana core area 
we anticipate production in our bay de chene field to be below previous levels until mid year we anticipate our total cost for the replacement of assets  repairs  and clean up costs related to hurricanes gustav and ike  primarily in the bay de chene field  will approximate million and we believe a portion of this will be reimbursed by insurance coverage 
during  we incurred approximately million of these costs  both capital and lease operating  and expect the remainder of these costs will be incurred in the first two quarters of and mainly relate to capital projects 
our overall costs and expenses increased in by million  primarily due to the non cash write down of oil and gas properties 
the largest increase in these costs and expenses was attributable to the non cash write down of oil and gas properties of million 
lease operating costs increased by due to a higher well count mainly from our south texas property acquisition in late  increasing costs for industry goods and services  higher natural gas processing costs during the year  and clean up and repair activities related to hurricanes gustav and ike 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased  mainly due to our larger depletable property base and a reduction in reserves volumes 
severance and other taxes also increased mainly due to increased oil and gas revenues 
we expect the market forces that were putting upward pressure on production costs in early will continue to soften as activity levels decline in response to falling commodity prices and current conditions in the financial markets in in  we will continue to focus upon our capital efficiency to better manage our costs and expenses  a difficult task in the inflationary cost environment prevalent in the industry over the last several years 
our lake washington field has experienced natural declines and reservoir pressure issues for some time 
in  permits were submitted to the state of louisiana to provide additional water injection into the newport reservoir for pressure maintenance 
however  based on our recent experiences  we do not anticipate that pressure maintenance activities will increase our production in lake washington before late in or early water injection into the current injection well is averaging about  barrels per day 
we have spent considerable time and capital on facility capacity upgrades and additions in the lake washington field 
our fourth production platform  the westside facility  was commissioned in the second quarter of and has increased our crude oil processing capacity another  barrels per day 
we ended with domestic proved reserves of mmboe  a decrease of over year end domestic reserves of mmboe 
as a result of performance  drilling  new geophysical information and revised mapping of multiple zones and the salt interface  a downward technical adjustment occurred in the cote blanche island field 
our st 
mary land proved undeveloped location was drilled during although successfully completed in one horizon  several other horizons were found to be non commercial 
these results led to downward technical adjustments of reserves in this area 
downward adjustments due to lower pricing at year end than in prior periods also led to lower reserves at the end of our year end domestic proved reserves were crude oil  natural gas  and ngls  compared to crude oil  natural gas  and ngls a year earlier 
domestic proved reserves were proved developed at december  our domestic production was crude oil  down from in asset acquisitions and dispositions in june  swift energy completed the sale of substantially all of our new zealand assets for million in cash after purchase price adjustments 
proceeds from this asset sale were used to pay down a portion of our credit facility 
in august  we completed the sale of our remaining new zealand permit for million  with three million payments to be received six months after the sale  months after the sale  and months after the sale 
all payments under this sale agreement are secured by unconditional letters of credit 
in connection with the sale of our last permit  a third party has brought suit against swift for breach of contract related to obtaining their consent for the transfer of the permit 
the third party has also brought suit against the new zealand ministry of economic development which challenges the transfer of this permit from swift energy to the purchaser 
we have evaluated the situation and believe we have not met the revenue recognition criteria at this time for the property sale  and have deferred the potential gain on this permit sale pending the outcome of this litigation 
accordingly  our new zealand operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and the assets and associated liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
in september  we acquired oil and natural gas interests in south texas for approximately million in cash including purchase price adjustments 
the property interests are located in the briscoe a lease in dimmit county 
these properties are now included within our south texas core area 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures related to continuing operations during were million  which includes million in acquisitions 
this amount increased by million as compared to  primarily due to an increase in our spending on drilling and development  predominantly in our southeast louisiana and south texas core areas 
these expenditures were funded by million of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations and proceeds from our new zealand asset sale 
given the current low oil and gas pricing environment  our presently budgeted capital expenditures range between million to million  net of minor non core dispositions and excluding any property acquisitions 
based upon current market conditions and our estimates  our capital expenditures for should be within our anticipated cash flow from operations 
for  due to our reduced capital budget when compared to previous years  we anticipate a decrease in production volumes from levels and we will not fully replace reserves produced in we may also increase our capital expenditure budget if commodity prices rise during the year or if strategic opportunities warrant 
if capital expenditures exceed our cash flow from operating activities  we anticipate funding those expenditures with our credit facility 
our capital expenditures are expected to include drilling up to three horizontal wells in the olmos sands in our awp field  drilling a well in the eagle ford shale formation of our awp field  drilling an exploratory well in our southeast louisiana core area along with completing a pipeline from our existing shasta well to the westside facility  facility projects in our bay de chene field  recompletions in our southeast louisiana core area  and fracture enhancements in our south texas core area 
we also plan to drill up to additional wells to shallow and intermediate depths in our southeast louisiana core area 
also in the lake washington and bay de chene fields during  we plan on continuing to work on our d seismic depth migration of the merged data sets with an updated salt model 
we also completed a pilot seismic pore pressure prediction project 
this has allowed us to increase our confidence level as we begin to drill some of the deeper and higher impact wells in this area of south louisiana 
for example  we have successfully completed our shasta prospect well and are preparing to hook this up to facilities 
we have recently completed drilling one of our west newport prospects and are preparing to complete this well 
a full inventory of deep and higher impact tests have been developed for future drilling 
this includes developing and planning a sub salt exploratory test  which could be drilled next year dependant upon the commodity pricing environment 
results of continuing operations years ended   and revenues 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in primarily due to higher oil and gas prices partially offset by decreased production from our southeast louisiana core area 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues due to increases in oil production from our southeast louisiana area and increases in oil prices 
revenues for   and were substantially comprised of oil and gas sales 
crude oil production was of our production volumes in  in  and in natural gas production was of our production volumes in  in  and in our properties are divided into the following core areas the southeast louisiana core area includes the lake washington and bay de chene fields 
the central louisiana east texas core area includes the brookeland  masters creek  and south bearhead creek fields 
the south louisiana core area includes the cote blanche island  horseshoe bayou bayou sale  jeanerette  and bayou penchant fields 
the south texas core area includes the awp  briscoe ranch  las tiendas  and sun tsh fields 
the most significant property in our strategic growth category is the high island field

had these gains been recognized in the oil and gas sales account  our average oil sales price would have been  and for   and  respectively  and our average natural gas sales price would have been  and for   and  respectively 
in  we settled all insurance claims with our insurers relating to hurricanes katrina and rita for approximately million and entered into a confidential final settlement agreement 
the receipt of these amounts resulted in a benefit of million in recorded in price risk management and other  net  for the portion of the above referenced settlement  which we have determined to be non property damage related claims 
approximately million of the above referenced settlement was determined to be property damage related claims 
we recorded million of the property related settlement as a reduction to proved properties on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  as this related to reimbursement of capital costs we incurred 
we also recorded million of the property related settlement as a reduction to lease operating cost on the accompanying consolidated statement of income  as this related to reimbursement of repair costs which had been expensed as incurred 
in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows  we have recorded the reimbursement which reduced proved properties as a reduction of cash used in investing activities continuing operations and the remainder of the insurance settlement was recorded as an increase to cash provided by operating activities continuing operations 
costs and expenses 
our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses for the reasons noted below 
our general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  over levels 
the increases in both and were primarily due to increased salaries and burdens associated with our expanded workforce  but were also impacted by increased restricted stock grants each year 
costs also increased in due to ongoing support costs of our new computer system implemented in for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per boe produced increased to per boe in from per boe in and per boe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for dd a increased million  or  in  from levels and increased million  or in  from levels 
the increase in was due to increases in the depletable oil and natural gas property base and lower reserves volumes  partially offset by lower production and lower future development costs 
the increase in was due to increases in the depletable oil and natural gas property base  including future development costs and higher production  partially offset by higher reserves volumes 
industry costs for goods and services have increased over the last three year period and have contributed to the increase in our dd a expense 
our dd a rate per boe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from increases in per unit cost of reserves additions 
we recorded million  million  and million of accretions to our asset retirement obligation in   and  respectively 
our lease operating costs increased million  or  over the level of such expenses in  while costs increased million  or over levels 
lease operating costs increased during due to additional costs from properties acquired in the fourth quarter of  increased work over costs  increasing costs for industry goods and services and higher natural gas and ngl processing costs in clean up and repair costs related to hurricanes gustav and ike totaled million in these costs increased in due to higher production  including costs from properties acquired in the fourth quarter of  increasing costs for industry goods and services and higher natural gas and ngl processing costs in a portion of the increase in was from increased well insurance premiums which increased after hurricanes katrina and rita 
our lease operating costs per boe produced were   and in   and  respectively 
severance and other taxes increased million  or  over levels  while in these taxes increased million  or over levels 
the increases in were due primarily to higher commodity prices  offset slightly by lower production 
in they were caused by higher commodity prices and increased production 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
severance taxes on oil in louisiana are of oil sales  which is higher than in the other states where we have production 
as our percentage of oil production in louisiana decreased in  the overall percentage of severance costs to sales also decreased 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
interest expense on our senior notes due issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in both and and million in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes due issued in april and retired in  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in interest expense on our senior notes due and issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in interest expense on our bank credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in other interest cost was million in each of  and we capitalize a portion of interest related to unproved properties 
the increase in interest expense in and was primarily due to an increase in borrowings against our line of credit facility for our fourth quarter property acquisition in south texas  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest costs 
in  we incurred million of debt retirement costs related to the redemption of our senior notes due the costs were comprised of approximately million of premiums paid to repurchase the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of low oil and natural gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
our overall effective tax rate was for  for and for the effective tax rate for   and was higher than the statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes 
valuation allowances also contributed to the and effective rates 
income loss from continuing operations 
our income loss from continuing operations for of million was significantly lower than our income from continuing operations of million due to the write down of oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by higher oil and gas sales 
our income from continuing operations in of million was higher than our income from continuing operations of million mainly due to higher oil prices 
net income loss 
our net income loss in of million was significantly lower than our net income of million  due to the write down of oil and gas properties  offset by higher oil and gas sales 
our net income in of million was lower than our net income of million mainly due to our loss from discontinued operations of million in the period 
full cost ceiling test as described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies  at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties including natural gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using period end prices  adjusted for the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments at december  that would affect this calculation 
in  as a result of low oil and natural gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and natural gas prices continue to decline from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that additional non cash write downs of oil and natural gas properties could occur in the future 
if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes  which also reduce our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  additional non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties could occur in the future 
we cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be  thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties if a decrease in oil and or natural gas prices were to occur 
discontinued operations in december  swift agreed to sell substantially all of our new zealand assets 
accordingly  the new zealand operations for and have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and the assets and associated liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
in june  swift energy completed the sale of substantially all of our new zealand assets for million in cash after purchase price adjustments 
proceeds from this asset sale were used to pay down a portion of our credit facility 
in august  we completed the sale of our remaining new zealand permit for million  with three million payments to be received six months after the sale  months after the sale  and months after the sale 
all payments under this sale agreement are secured by unconditional letters of credit 
in connection with the sale of our last permit  a third party has brought suit against swift energy for breach of contract related to obtaining their consent for the transfer of the permit 
the third party has also brought suit against the new zealand ministry of economic development which challenges the transfer of this permit from swift energy to the purchaser 
we have evaluated the situation and believe we have not met the revenue recognition criteria at this time for the permit sale  and have deferred the potential gain on this property sale pending the outcome of this litigation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the results of operations and the non cash asset write down for the new zealand operations have been excluded from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations for the current and prior periods 
furthermore  the assets included as part of this divestiture have been reclassified as held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
during the fourth quarter of and the full year of  the company assessed its long lived assets in new zealand based on the selling price and terms of the sales agreement in place at that time and recorded non cash asset write downs of million and million  respectively  related to these assets 
these write downs are recorded in income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income 
as of december   operations in new zealand had represented less than of our total assets and approximately of our sales volumes 
these revenues and expenses were historically reported under our new zealand operating segment  and are now reported under discontinued operations

our capitalized general and administrative expenses were immaterial for and for years and were million  and million 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for decreased compared to primarily due to the non cash write down of property and equipment  a decrease in produced oil and natural gas volumes which reduced revenues  partially offset by a tax benefit associated with the non cash write down of property and equipment  along with lower depletion expense due to lower production volumes 
commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and over the last six months that volatility has increased to extreme levels  and low prices are expected to continue for and possibly future periods 
the price of oil began to decline in the third quarter of  price declines accelerated in the fourth quarter of  and have further decreased during the first quarter of factors such as worldwide economic conditions and credit availability  worldwide supply disruptions  weather conditions  fluctuating currency exchange rates  and political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  can cause fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices remained high during much of when compared to longer term historical prices but began falling in the third quarter of and have continued to fall into the first quarter of north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  economic conditions and credit availability  storage levels of natural gas  the level of liquefied natural gas imports  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
credit risk due to certain concentrations we extend credit  primarily in the form of uncollateralized oil and natural gas sales and joint interest owners receivables  to various companies in the oil and gas industry  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
the concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in economic or other conditions within our industry and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
credit losses in and have been immaterial  but given the downturn in the industry we have examined every one of our purchasers of oil and gas for credit worthiness 
we believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the size  reputation  and nature of the companies to which we extend credit 
for and  oil and gas sales to shell oil corporation and affiliates were and of total oil and gas sales  respectively  while during and  chevron corporation and its affiliates accounted for and of our total oil and gas sales  respectively 
from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit or parent company guaranties  if applicable  to reduce risk of loss 
commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we have been party to various legal actions  which arise primarily from our activities as operator of oil and natural gas wells 
in management s opinion  the outcome of any such currently pending legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources recent extreme volatility in worldwide credit and financial markets  combined with rapidly falling prices for oil and natural gas  all of which began in the third quarter of  will have a significant impact on our cash flow  capital expenditures  and liquidity in future periods 
see overview financial condition 
net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in revenues  mainly attributable to higher oil and natural gas prices during the first part of the year  offset in part by lower production and higher lease operating costs and severance taxes due to higher oil and gas sales 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher oil prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs and severance taxes due to higher oil prices and higher production 
accounts receivable 
we assess the collectability of accounts receivable  and  based on our judgment  we accrue a reserve when we believe a receivable may not be collected 
at both december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has been deducted from the total accounts receivable balances on the accompanying balance sheets 
at december   we had million in receivables for concluded oil hedges covering production which are recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other receivables and were subsequently collected in january existing credit facility 
we had borrowings of million under our bank credit facility at december   and million in borrowings at december  our bank credit facility at december  consisted of a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base 
effective november   our lenders reaffirmed our borrowing base and commitment amount as part of their normal recurring borrowing base review which occurs every six months 
the borrowing base was increased by our bank group from million to million in november under the terms of our bank credit facility  we can increase this commitment amount to the total amount of the borrowing base at our discretion  subject to the terms of the credit agreement 
in september  we increased the commitment amount from million to million 
our revolving credit facility includes requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and expect to remain in compliance with these provisions in and future periods 
our access to funds from our credit facility is not restricted under any material adverse condition clause  a clause that is common for credit agreements to include 
our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report events or conditions having a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 
our available borrowings under our line of credit facility provide us liquidity 
in light of recent credit market volatility  many financial institutions have experienced liquidity issues  and governments have intervened in these markets to create liquidity 
we have reviewed the creditworthiness of the banks that fund our credit facility and thus far our bank liquidity has not been impacted 
however  if the current credit market volatility is prolonged  future extensions of our credit facility may contain terms and interest rates not as favorable as those of our current credit facility 
the borrowing base of million was reaffirmed effective november  as part of the normal recurring semi annual re determination 
the next scheduled borrowing base review is may  and it is possible the borrowing base and commitment amounts could be reduced due to lower oil and gas prices and the current state of the financial and credit markets 
working capital 
our working capital decreased from a deficit of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the decrease primarily resulted from the sale of our new zealand assets in which were classified as current assets held for sale  along with lower oil and gas receivables due to lower oil and gas prices at year end  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued capital costs 
debt retirements and debt issuances 
in june  we issued million of senior notes due in june  we redeemed all million of senior subordinated notes due and recorded a charge of million related to the redemption of these notes  which is recorded in debt retirement costs on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income 
the costs were comprised of approximately million of premium paid to redeem the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
debt maturities 
our credit facility  with a balance of million at december   extends until october  our million of senior notes mature july   and our million of senior notes mature june  capital expenditures 
in  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of  cash proceeds from the sale of most of our new zealand assets of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million including million of acquisitions 
we have spent considerable time and capital on facility capacity upgrades and additions in the lake washington field 
since acquiring the property  we have upgraded three production platforms  added new compression for the gas lift system  and installed a new oil delivery system and permanent barge loading facility 
during  we completed the addition of a fourth production platform  the westside facility  which increased our processing capacity another  barrels per day 
we completed of wells in during  for a completion rate of 
a total of development wells were completed in the lake washington field  and out of development wells were completed in the awp field 
in each of the bay de chene and south bearhead creek fields  we completed five development wells  and we completed of development wells in the sun tsh and briscoe ranch fields  completed two development wells in the horseshoe bayou bayou sale field  completed one out of three development wells in the jeanerette field  drilled one unsuccessful development well in the masters creek field  and drilled one successful non operated well in alabama 
we also completed one exploratory well in each of the bay de chene and cote blanche island fields  and drilled one unsuccessful exploratory well in the high island field 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in in  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of  credit facility borrowings of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million including million of acquisitions 
during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of million  bank borrowings of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million  including acquisitions of million 
in  we participated in drilling development wells and five exploratory wells  of which development wells and two exploratory wells were completed 
in response to lower commodity prices  the company has reduced its capital expenditure budget for and anticipates lower capital expenditures in than in because our exploration and development activities are to a degree scalable  we anticipate being able to adjust our capital expenditures to the level of cash flow from operations  supplemented with funds available under our credit facility 
contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total in thousands non cancelable operating leases asset retirement obligation drilling rigs  seismic services  and pipe inventory senior notes due senior notes due credit facility total our most significant office lease is in houston  texas and it extends until amounts shown by year are the fair values at december  amounts do not include the interest obligation  which is paid semiannually

proved oil and gas reserves at year end  our proved reserves were mmboe with a pv value of billion pv is a non gaap measure  see the section titled oil and natural gas reserves in our property section for a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the closest gaap measure  the standardized measure 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves decreased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent decrease of mmboe  or 
in  our domestic proved natural gas reserves increased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of mmboe  or 
we added reserves over the past three years through both our drilling activity and purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added mmboe of proved reserves in  mmboe in  and mmboe in through acquisitions we added mmboe of proved reserves in  bcfe in  and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end the pv value of our domestic proved reserves at year end decreased from the pv value at year end natural gas prices decreased at year end to per mcf from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end oil prices decreased at year end to per bbl from per bbl at year end  compared to in under sec guidelines  estimates of proved reserves must be made using year end oil and gas sales prices and are held constant for that year s reserves calculation throughout the life of the properties 
subsequent changes to such year end oil and natural gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
as noted in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in december the sec issued a release which changes the accounting and disclosure requirements surrounding oil and gas reserves and is intended to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements  to align them with current industry practices and to adapt to changes in technology 
this release is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after january  income taxes the tax laws in the jurisdictions we operate in are continuously changing and professional judgments regarding such tax laws can differ 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  given the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
on january   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under fin  tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more likely than not threshold  and those tax positions requiring recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
as a result of adopting fin  we reported a million decrease to our january  retained earnings balance and a corresponding increase to other long term liabilities 
in the th quarter of we recorded additional tax expense and increased other long term liabilities by million  which increased our total balance of our unrecognized tax benefits to million 
if recognized  these tax benefits would fully impact our effective tax rate 
we do not believe the total of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the next months 
our policy is to record interest and penalties relating to income taxes in income tax expense 
as of december   we have accrued million for interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
our us federal income tax returns from through and forward  our louisiana income tax returns from forward  our new zealand income tax returns after  and our texas franchise tax returns after remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities 
there are no unresolved items related to periods previously audited by these taxing authorities 
no other state returns are significant to our financial position 
in the third quarter of  we increased the valuation allowance for our capital loss carryforward assets by million to cover the full value of the carryforward 
the increase in the valuation allowance was due to changes in the company s property disposition plans and increased income tax expense of million in that period 
subsequently  all but million of our capital loss carryforward assets have expired  and we continue to carry a valuation allowance for the full remaining balance

related party transactions we receive research  technical writing  publishing  and website related services from tec com inc  a corporation located in knoxville  tennessee  and controlled and majority owned by the aunt of the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
we paid approximately million to tec com for such services pursuant to the terms of the contract between the parties in  million in and million in the contract was renewed june   on substantially the same terms as the previous contract and expires june  we believe that the terms of this contract are consistent with third party arrangements that provide similar services 
as a matter of corporate governance policy and practice  related party transactions are presented and considered by the corporate governance committee of our board of directors 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may pertain to  among other things  financial results  capital expenditures  drilling activity  development activities  cost savings  production efforts and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  cash flows  available borrowing capacity  liquidity  acquisition plans  regulatory matters  and competition 
such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan  future  estimate  expect  budget  predict  anticipate  projected  should  believe  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current plans  expectations  estimates  and assumptions  upon current market conditions  and upon engineering and geologic information available at this time  and is subject to change and to a number of risks and uncertainties  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are volatility in oil and natural gas prices  availability of services and supplies  disruption of operations and damages due to hurricanes or tropical storms  fluctuations of the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas  the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates  operating hazards  requirements for and availability of capital  conditions in the financial and credit markets  general economic conditions  changes in geologic or engineering information  changes in market conditions  competition and government regulations  as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report and set forth from time to time in our other public reports  filings  and public statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices began in the last four months of  and the effects of such pricing volatility are expected to continue into our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
we do not utilize these agreements and financial instruments for trading and only enter into derivative agreements with banks in our credit facility 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
price floors at december   we had no outstanding derivative instruments in place for production 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows based on this same level of borrowing 
income tax carryforwards 
as of december   the company has net tax carryforwards assets of million for federal net operating losses  for federal alternative minimum tax credits and million for state tax net operating loss carryforwards which in management s judgment will more likely than not be utilized to offset future taxable earnings 
we also have a million capital loss carryforward asset that in management s judgment has a less than more likely than not probability of being utilized 
accordingly  the capital loss carryover asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the company s new zealand subsidiaries have local income tax loss carryovers which are available if any future income is generated by these entities 
as of december  the estimated us dollar value of these loss carryover assets is million 
in management s judgment it is less than more likely than not that the remaining carryover assets will be utilized 
accordingly  these carryover assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair value of our senior notes due  were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectfully 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair values of our senior notes due were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectfully 
the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  and the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  and customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
continued volatility in both credit and commodity markets may reduce the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit  parent company guaranties if applicable  and other collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
