item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading national provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services  based upon annual revenue and number of diagnostic imaging systems deployed  and are a provider of radiation oncology services 
our principal sources of revenue are derived from magnetic resonance imaging mri and positron emission tomography computed tomography pet ct 
we provide imaging and therapeutic services primarily to hospitals and other healthcare providers on a shared service and full time service basis 
we also provide services through a growing number of fixed site imaging centers  primarily to hospitals or health systems 
our services normally include the use of our imaging systems  technologists to operate the systems  equipment maintenance and upgrades and management of day to day shared service and fixed site diagnostic imaging operations 
we also provide non scan based services  which includes only the use of our imaging systems under a short term contract 
we have also leveraged our leadership in mri and pet ct to expand into radiation oncology 
our radiation oncology business is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary  alliance oncology  llc ao  and includes a wide range of services for cancer patients covering initial consultation  preparation for treatment  simulation of treatment  actual radiation oncology delivery  therapy management and follow up care 
our services include the use of our linear accelerators  therapists to operate such systems  administrative staff  equipment maintenance and upgrades  and management of day to day operations 
we also provide stereotactic radiation oncology services through our wholly owned subsidiary  alliance radiosurgery  llc 
mri and pet ct services generated and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december   and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  and and of our revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  the remaining revenue was comprised of radiation oncology revenue and other modality diagnostic imaging services revenue  primarily computed tomography ct and management contract revenue 
we had diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology systems  including mri systems and positron emission tomography pet or pet ct systems and served over  clients in states at december  we operated fixed site imaging centers four in unconsolidated joint ventures  which constitutes systems installed in hospitals or other medical buildings on or near hospital campuses  including modular buildings  systems installed inside medical groups offices  and free standing fixed site imaging centers  which includes systems installed in a medical office building  ambulatory surgical center  or other retail space at december  of the fixed site imaging centers  were mri fixed site imaging centers  were pet or pet ct fixed site imaging centers  seven were other modality fixed site imaging centers and four were in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we also operated radiation oncology centers and stereotactic radiosurgery facilities including two radiation oncology centers in unconsolidated joint ventures at december  approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were generated by providing services to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which we refer to as wholesale revenues 
our wholesale revenues are typically generated from contracts that require our clients to pay us based on the number of scans we perform on patients on our clients behalf  although some pay us a flat fee for a period of time regardless of the number of scans we perform 
wholesale payments are due to us independent of our clients receipt of retail reimbursement from third party payors  although receipt of reimbursement from third party payors may affect demand for our services 
we typically deliver our services for a set number of days per week through exclusive  long term contracts with hospitals and other healthcare providers 
the initial terms of these contracts average approximately three years in length for mobile services and approximately five to years in length for fixed site arrangements 
these contracts often contain automatic renewal provisions and certain contracts have cancellation clauses if the hospital or other healthcare provider purchases their own system 
we price our contracts based on the type of system used  the scan volume  and the number of ancillary services provided 
pricing is also affected by competitive pressures 
approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were generated by providing services directly to patients from our sites located at or near hospitals or other healthcare provider facilities  which we refer to as retail revenue 
our revenue from these sites is generated from direct billings to patients or their third party payors  including medicare  which are recorded net of contractual discounts and other arrangements for providing services at discounted prices 
we typically charge a higher price per scan under retail billing than we do under wholesale billing 
fixed site imaging centers and radiation oncology centers can be structured as either wholesale or retail arrangements 
revenues from these centers are included in both our wholesale or retail revenues  respectively 
for services for which we bill medicare directly  we are paid under the medicare physician fee schedule  which is updated on an annual basis 
under the medicare statutory formula  payments under the physician fee schedule would have decreased for the past several years if congress failed to intervene 
for example  for  the fee schedule rates were to be reduced by approximately 
the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of eliminated the reduction for and increased the annual payment rate update by 
this increase to the annual medicare physician fee schedule payment update was effective only for medicare claims with dates of service between january  and june  beginning july   under the medicare improvement for patients and providers act of mippa  the increase was continued for the rest of in addition  mippa established a increase to the medicare physician fee schedule payment update for mippa also modified the methodology by which the budget neutrality formula was applied to the physician fee schedule payment rates  however  resulting in an overall reduction in payment rates for services performed by many specialties  including an estimated reduction for radiation oncology and reduction for nuclear medicine 
the impact of the payment rates on specific companies depends on their service mix 
at this time  we estimate slight decreases in rates for our radiation oncology business but cannot predict the full impact the rate reductions will have on our future revenues or business 
also with respect to mippa  the legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical component of diagnostic mri  ct  pet and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization designated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms by january  though cms has not yet designated the accreditation organizations  all our facilities are accredited by the joint commission 
a number of other legislative changes impact our retail business 
for example  the deficit reduction act of dra imposed caps on medicare payment rates for certain imaging services  furnished in physician s offices and other non hospital based settings 
the caps impact mri  pet  and certain imaging services performed in conjunction with radiation therapy  including certain igrt services and diagnostic imaging services used to plan imrt 
under the cap  payments for specified imaging services cannot exceed the hospital outpatient payment rates for those services 
this change applied to services furnished on or after january  the limitation is applicable to the technical components of the diagnostic imaging services only  which is the payment we receive for the services for which we bill directly under the medicare physician fee schedule 
cms issues on an annual basis the hospital outpatient prospective payment hopps rates  which are used to develop the caps 
the reimbursement for the technical component under the physician fee schedule generally allows for higher reimbursement than under hopps 
the implementation of this reimbursement reduction contained in the dra had a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in  whereas the changes from to were limited 
in addition  as indicated above  the hopps payments are the amounts received by our hospital clients for hospital outpatient services 
on november   cms released its final determination of medicare part b hopps reimbursement rates for pet and pet ct imaging procedures  effective january  for  the national payment rate for nonmyocardial pet and pet ct scans was  per scan and the national payment rate for myocardial pet scans was  per scan 
in its final hopps reimbursement rates  cms also bundled the pet and pet ct payment for radiopharmaceuticals with the payment for the pet and pet ct scan 
in addition  cms reduced the national medicare hopps rate for mri scans by approximately 
the national medicare hopps payment rates for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment delivery services ranged from  to  depending on the level of service 
on october   cms released its national medicare hopps payment rates  effective january  for nonmyocardial pet and pet ct  the payment rate is  per scan 
for myocardial pet procedures  the payment rate is  per scan 
for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment delivery services  the payment rates range from to  depending on the level of service 
for full year  we estimate that approximately of our revenue was billed directly to the medicare program 
if the dra had been in effect for full year  we estimate the reduction in medicare revenue due to the dra reimbursement rate decrease would have reduced revenue by approximately million and the pet and pet ct medicare hopps reduction would have reduced revenue by approximately million 
combined  the dra and pet and pet ct medicare hopps rate reductions would have negatively impacted our revenue and did impact our revenue by a total of approximately million and million  respectively 
for  however  the dra and the net medicare rate reductions in hopps have not had a material negative effect on revenue and earnings  and we do not believe that such changes will have a material negative effect on revenue and earnings for also to date  in  we did not face an increase in pressure in wholesale pricing for pet and pet ct as a result of the reductions in medicare reimbursement rates from the implementation of the dra and revised pet and pet ct reimbursements under hopps 
at this time  however  we cannot predict the impact the rate reductions will have on our future revenues or business 
furthermore  with respect to the final medicare physician fee schedule rule for calendar year  cms announced additional performance standards for suppliers of mobile diagnostic services 
the final rule requires suppliers of mobile diagnostic services under certain circumstances to enroll in medicare and bill directly for these services  regardless of where they are performed 
an exception was made for services provided to hospital patients under arrangement with that hospital 
in those circumstances  the mobile diagnostic facility would be required to enroll in medicare  but the hospital would bill for the services 
on december   cms issued additional guidance that companies that lease or contract with a medicare enrolled provider or supplier to provide only diagnostic testing equipment and or non physician personnel are not required to enroll in medicare 
the agency nonetheless indicated that it is continuing to evaluate such arrangements 
at this time  we do not expect that the new policies will significantly impact our business 
in and  the growth rate of mri industry wide scan volumes has slowed in part due to weak hospital volumes as reported by several investor owned hospital companies  a growing number of medical groups adding imaging capacity within their practice setting  the increasing trend of third party payors intensifying their utilization management efforts to control mri scan volume growth rate and additional patient related cost sharing programs 
we expect that this trend will continue throughout further  president barack obama s budget for fiscal year includes provisions that may require the use of radiology benefit managers to preauthorize certain imaging services 
at this time  it is unclear what impact this might have on our future revenues or business 
we have experienced and continue to experience an increase in the competitive climate in the mri industry  resulting in an increase in activity by original equipment manufacturers  or oems  selling systems directly to certain of our clients 
typically  oems target our higher scan volume clients 
this increase in activity by oems has resulted in overcapacity of systems in the marketplace  especially related to medical groups adding imaging capacity within their practice setting 
this has caused an increase in the number of our higher scan volume clients deciding not to renew their contracts 
we replace these higher volume clients typically with lower volume clients 
during  our mri revenues increased compared to levels due to an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of  which was partially offset by the modest decrease in scan volume 
we believe that mri revenues will modestly decline in future years 
recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and wide spread recession  inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the united states mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states economy 
added concerns fueled by the federal government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association  the declared bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc  the united states government financial assistance to american international group inc  citibank  bank of america and other federal government interventions in the united states financial system led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our customers  to timely replace maturing liabilities  and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
the principal components of our cost of revenues are compensation paid to technologists and drivers  system maintenance costs  medical supplies  system transportation and technologists travel costs 
because a majority of these expenses are fixed  increased revenues as a result of higher scan volumes per system significantly improves our margins while lower scan volumes result in lower margins 
the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are sales and marketing costs  corporate overhead costs  provision for doubtful accounts  and share based payment 
we record minority interest expense and earnings from unconsolidated investees related to our consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries  respectively 
these subsidiaries primarily provide shared service and fixed site diagnostic imaging and therapeutic services 
seasonality we experience seasonality in the revenues and margins generated for our services 
in and  the first and second quarters had more scanning days than the third and fourth quarters 
third and fourth quarter revenues are affected by holiday and client and patient vacation schedules  resulting in fewer scans during the period 
the first quarter of benefited from one extra calendar day due to leap year 
the second half of had less scanning days than the first half of the variability in margins is higher than the variability in revenues due to the fixed nature of our costs 
kkr acquisition and disposition on november   viewer holdings llc  an affiliate of kkr  acquired approximately of alliance in a recapitalization merger

scan based systems in service decreased to systems in from systems in to adjust to a decline in mri scan volumes to maintain the efficiency of our mobile mri systems 
average scans per system per day also decreased by to in from in these decreases were partially offset by a increase in the average price per mri scan to per scan in compared to per scan in and an increase in non scan based mri revenue of million in over other modalities and other revenue declined million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to a decrease in management contract revenue for our management agreements and a decrease in ct revenue 
pet and pet ct revenue in increased million  or  compared to total pet and pet ct scan volumes increased to  scans in from  scans in  primarily as a result of growth in our core pet and pet ct business 
the average number of pet and pet ct systems in service increased to systems in from systems in scans per system per day increased  to scans per system per day in versus scans per system per day in these pet and pet ct increases were partially offset by a decline in the average price per pet and pet ct scan  to  per scan in compared to  per scan in the decline in pet and pet ct average price per scan is primarily due to the impact of the dra and hopps reimbursement rate reductions which became effective january  included in the revenue totals above are fixed site revenues which increased million  or  to million in from million in we had mri systems at december  compared to mri systems at december  we had pet and pet ct systems at december  compared to pet and pet ct systems at december  we operated fixed site imaging centers including five in unconsolidated joint ventures at december   compared to fixed site imaging centers including three in unconsolidated joint ventures at december  we operated radiation oncology centers including two in unconsolidated joint ventures at december  cost of revenues  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in during  we recorded litigation settlements including a settlement of our class action lawsuit for million of million 
medical supplies decreased million  or  primarily as a result of a decrease in fdg costs  which are used as a component of pet and pet ct scan as a result of sourcing discounts  partially offset by an increase in fdg costs due to an increase in the number of pet and pet ct scans 
medical supplies also decreased due to a decrease in film costs related to lower mri scan volume 
equipment rental expense decreased million  or  primarily due to a lower number of rental systems in use to support current clients as a result of improved system utilization 
outside medical services decreased million  or  primarily as a result of a decrease in medical service costs and radiologist service costs associated with lower mri scan volume  and a decrease in temporary staffing needs

income tax expense was million and million in and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and in and  respectively 
our effective tax rates for were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state income taxes 
minority interest expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in earnings from unconsolidated investees increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in  primarily due to a million gain on sale from a sale leaseback transaction in one of our unconsolidated investees  as well as a million gain on the sale of real estate during our net income was million  or per share on a diluted basis  in compared to million  or per share on a diluted basis  in liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities 
we generated million and million of cash flow from operating activities in and  respectively 
our ability to generate cash flow is affected by numerous factors  including demand for mri  pet  other diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services 
our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is also dependent upon the collections of our accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our number of days of revenue outstanding for our accounts receivable was days and days as of december  and  respectively  which we believe is among the more favorable in the healthcare service industry 
we used cash of million and million for investing activities in and  respectively 
investing activities in and includes cash used for acquisitions of million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to use cash for acquisitions in the future 
other than acquisitions  our primary use of capital resources is to fund capital expenditures 
we incur capital expenditures for the purposes of purchasing new systems  replacing less advanced systems with new systems  and providing upgrades of our mri  pet and pet ct  and radiation oncology systems and upgrading our corporate infrastructure for future growth 
capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during we purchased mri systems  pet ct systems and two other systems 
our decision to purchase a new system is typically predicated on obtaining new or extending existing client contracts  which serve as the basis of demand for the new system 
we expect to purchase additional systems in and finance substantially all of these purchases with our available cash  cash from operating activities  our revolving line of credit  and equipment leases 
based upon the client demand described above  which dictates the type of equipment purchased  we expect cash capital expenditures to total approximately to million in at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in high quality money market instruments  primarily direct obligations of the government of the united states 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at december   we had million in our accounts that are with third party financial institutions which exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
in connection with the acquisition of alliance by an affiliate of kkr  we entered into a million credit agreement consisting of a million tranche a term loan facility  a million tranche b term facility  a million tranche c term loan facility and a revolving loan facility 
on june   we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement and completed a million refinancing of our tranche b and c term loan facility 
under the terms of the amended term loan facility  we received proceeds of million from a new tranche c term loan facility  and used the entire amount of the proceeds to retire million and million owed under tranche b and c of our existing term loan facility  respectively 
the new tranche c borrowing rate was decreased to london interbank offered rate libor plus in december  we entered into a third amendment to our credit agreement which revised our tranche c term loan facility tranche c resulting in incremental borrowings of million and decreased the maximum amount of availability under our existing revolving loan facility from million to million 
we applied the proceeds from the amendment to retirement of million of our million senior subordinated notes due the notes through a cash tender offer the tender offer  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amended tranche c borrowing rate decreased to libor plus 
on december  we entered into a fourth amendment to our credit agreement which revised our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant to a level not to exceed to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter until the expiration of the agreement 
prior to the fourth amendment  our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant was to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter beginning march  to the expiration of the agreement 
the fourth amendment also requires us to maintain a maximum consolidated senior leverage ratio covenant at a level not to exceed to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
the amendment increased the tranche c libor margin from an annual rate of to 
in connection with the amendment  we incurred an amendment fee of million 
in december  we completed the tender offer and redeemed million of our outstanding notes 
during  we paid the remaining balance of million related to the notes  which had an original balance of million 
at december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan facility 
approximately million of our million revolving line of credit is held by lcpi  a subsidiary of lehman brothers  which has filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
we do not expect that lcpi would fund this commitment if requested to do so 
we intend to replace lcpi as a lender under our revolving line of credit to the extent we are able to do so given the current condition of the global financial markets 
to the extent we are not able to replace lcpi as a lender under the revolving line of credit  we do not expect that lcpi s inability to fund its commitment would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
as of december   excluding the commitment of lcpi  we had million of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
the amended credit agreement contains restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  liens and encumbrances  capital expenditures and prepayments of other indebtedness 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement and expect that we will be in compliance with these covenants in however  if we are unable to generate sufficient consolidated adjusted ebitda  as defined in our credit agreement  or manage our indebtedness to sufficient levels  we could be out of compliance with our maximum consolidated leverage ratio and maximum consolidated senior leverage ratio 
our failure to comply with these covenants could permit the lenders under the credit agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the agreement  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under the credit facility 
if we are not able to refinance our debt  we could become subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
in december  we issued million of our senior subordinated notes due the original notes in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and applied the proceeds to repayment of a portion of our notes 
the original notes were subsequently registered 
on december   we issued an additional million of our senior subordinated notes due the new notes in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act 
the new notes were subsequently registered 
the new notes were issued at a discount of  which is being amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of the notes 
the new notes have terms that are substantially identical to our original notes  but were issued under a new indenture and are therefore a separate series of notes 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the new notes to repay and terminate an acquisition credit facility we entered into the previous month to finance the nehe acquisition as described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include future acquisitions 
the original notes and the new notes are collectively referred to as the notes 
the notes contain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  liens and encumbrances  and restrictive payments 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt  including bank debt  and all obligations of our subsidiaries 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the notes and forecast that we will be in compliance with these covenants in our failure to comply with these covenants could permit the trustee under the indentures relating to the notes and the note holders to declare the principal amounts under the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if the indebtedness under the notes  or any of our other indebtedness  is accelerated  and we are not able to refinance our debt  we could become subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts of million  million and million to manage the future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt 
these agreements matured during we recorded changes in the fair value of the swaps through interest expense 
in the first quarter of  we entered into multiple interest rate collar agreements for our variable rate bank debt 
the total underlying notional amount of the debt was million 
under these arrangements we purchased a cap on the interest rate of and sold a floor of 
we paid a net purchase price of million for these collars 
these agreements were two and three years in length and matured at various dates between january and january we designated these collars as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt and recorded changes in the fair value of the collars through comprehensive income during the period these instruments were designated as hedges 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million each  to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurs interest based on three month libor plus 
these agreements are three years in length and mature in as discussed below  we elected to terminate one of the swaps in february we have designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt and will record effective changes in the fair value of the swaps through comprehensive income loss during the period these instruments are designated as hedges 
on september   lhi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on october   lcpi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
one of our swaps with a notional amount of million  which expires january   is with lcpi the lehman swap 
as of september  hedge accounting was terminated and all further changes in the fair market value of the lehman swap are being recorded in interest expense and other 
comprehensive income loss related to effective unrealized gains or losses on the fair value of the lehman swap through september  remain in accumulated comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense and other as the underlying interest payments are recognized in earnings 
the lehman swap was valued using the income approach with observable level market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount 
the fair market value of the lehman swap at september  was an asset of million  which was adjusted to zero as collectability was deemed uncertain due to the lhi bankruptcy filing 
we included the write down of the asset in interest expense and other for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we replaced the lehman swap with an interest rate swap agreement which has a notional amount of million and has been designated as a cash flow hedge of variable future cash flows associated with a portion of our long term debt 
under the terms of this agreement  which matures in january  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurs interest based on three month libor plus 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which has a notional amount of million to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt 
under the terms of this agreement  which matures in november  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedge is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurs interest based on three month libor plus 
in and  we used cash flow from operating activities to pay down million and million  respectively  under tranche c of the term loan facility 
the maturities of our long term debt  including interest  future payments under our operating leases and binding equipment purchase commitments as of december  are as follows contractual obligations thereafter total in millions term loan tranche c senior subordinated notes equipment loans operating leases letters of credit equipment purchase commitments total contractual obligation payments less amount representing interest present value of future contractual obligations our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of  at december  has been omitted from the above table because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months  however  we do not expect the change will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations  our cash flow from operating activities  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under our credit facilities  will be sufficient over the next one to two years to fund anticipated capital expenditures and potential acquisitions and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we were a party to interest rate swap agreements related to million of outstanding principal on our variable rate debt 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenues is derived directly from healthcare providers and is primarily for imaging services 
to a lesser extent  revenues are generated from direct billings to patients or their medical payors which are recorded net of contractual discounts and other arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates 
revenues from direct patient billing amounted to approximately  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continuously monitor collections from direct patient billings and compare these collections to revenue  net of contractual discounts  recorded at the time of service 
while such contractual discounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  an inability to accurately estimate contractual discounts in the future could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
as the price is predetermined  all revenues are recognized at the time the delivery of imaging service has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured  which is based upon contract terms with healthcare providers and negotiated rates with third party payors and patients 
accounts receivable we provide shared and single user diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology equipment and technical support services to the healthcare industry and directly to patients on an outpatient basis 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from hospitals  other healthcare providers and health insurance providers located throughout the united states 
services are generally provided pursuant to long term contracts with hospitals and other healthcare providers or directly to patients  and generally collateral is not required 
receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third party payors 
we continuously monitor collections from our clients and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon any specific client collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  an inability to accurately estimate credit losses in the future could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
goodwill and long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
in accordance with sfas  we have selected to perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the financial information for the twelve months ended september  or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate an impairment of these assets has possibly occurred 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to our various reporting units  which are our geographical regions 
sfas requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives within the reporting unit are less than the carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
we comply with periodic impairment test procedures 
in  and we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  indicating no goodwill or intangible asset impairment was present 
no triggering events occurred during the fourth quarters of  and which required an additional impairment test as of december   or sfas also requires intangible assets with definite useful lives to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in  and we concluded that no impairment was present in our intangible assets with definite useful lives 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
future income tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that the realization of such benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to significantly increase our valuation allowance  resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the board s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
sfas was effective and adopted by us on january  the provisions of sfas are being applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position as we did not elect the fair value option for any of our financial assets or liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items  including acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests formerly known as minority interests see sfas discussion below will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
accordingly  since we are a calendar year end company we will continue to record and disclose business combinations following existing generally accepted accounting principles until january  we expect sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is generally dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we have not completed our evaluation of the potential impact of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which enhances the current guidance on disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation 
specifically  sfas requires disclosure about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flow 
this statement requires qualitative disclosure about the objectives and strategies for using derivatives in terms of the risks that the entity is intending to manage  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments in a tabular format  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements to provide information on potential effect on an entity s liquidity from using derivatives 
the derivative instruments shall be distinguished between those used for risk management purposes and those used for other purposes 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
as sfas provides only disclosure requirements  the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services exclusively in the united states and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly because the majority of our indebtedness has interest rates which are variable 
the recorded carrying amount of our long term debt under our existing credit agreement approximates fair value as these borrowings have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt 
to decrease the risk associated with interest rate increases  we have entered into multiple interest rate swap and collar agreements for a portion of our variable rate debt 
these swaps and collars are designated as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt 
during we entered into swap agreements which had notional amounts of million  million and million 
under the terms of these agreements  we received three month libor and paid a fixed rate of   and  respectively 
the net effect was to record interest expense at fixed rates of  and respectively  as the debt incurred interest based on three month libor plus 
for the year ended december   we received a net settlement amount of million 
the swap agreements matured during the second and fourth quarters of during  we entered into multiple interest rate collar agreements which have a notional amount of million 
under the terms of these agreements  we purchased a cap on the interest rate of and sold a floor of 
for the years ended december  and  we received a net settlement amount of and million  respectively  on these collar agreements 
the collar agreements matured at various dates between january and january during the first quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements which have notional amounts of million each  to hedge future cash interest payments associated with a portion of our variable rate bank debt the swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at a fixed rate of  as the debt incurs interest based on three month libor plus 
for the year ended december   we paid a net settlement amount of million 
the swaps are three years in length and mature in one of these swaps was terminated in february  as discussed below 
the collar agreements and the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with our long term debt 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the collars and the swaps are  and will be  recorded at fair value 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of the collars and swaps will be determined based on quoted market prices and  assuming perfect effectiveness  the difference between the fair value and the book value of the collars will be recognized in comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
on a quarterly basis the fair value of the swaps will be determined based on the income approach using observable level inputs 
the fair market value of the swaps will be recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities with all effective changes deferred in comprehensive income 
any ineffectiveness of the collars and swaps is required to be recognized in earnings 
the swaps expose us to credit risk in the event that the counterparties to the agreements do not or cannot meet their obligations 
the notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the loss would be limited to the amount that would have been received  if any  over the remaining life of the swaps 
on a quarterly basis  the counterparties are evaluated for non performance risk 
on september   lhi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  and as a result  hedge accounting was terminated on the lehman swap  with a notional amount of million 
all further changes in the fair market value of this swap were recorded in interest expense and other 
on october   lcpi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the fair market value of the lehman swap at september  was an asset of million which was written down to zero as collectability was deemed uncertain due to the lhi bankruptcy filing 
the write down of this amount is included in interest expense and other for year ended december  for the year ended december   we included million in interest expense and other related to the fair value adjustment for this swap as we did not expect lcpi to fulfill their obligations under the swap agreement 
as a result  we terminated the lehman swap in february we paid million for the remaining fair market value of the swap at the date of termination 
additionally  the credit crisis could have an impact on our other interest rate swap agreement if that counterparty files for bankruptcy or is otherwise unable to perform its obligations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
the collars outstanding at december  matured during january  and all counterparty obligations were met 
during the first quarter of  we replaced the lehman swap with an interest rate swap agreement which has a notional amount of million and has been designated as a cash flow hedge of variable future cash flows associated with a portion of our long term debt 
under the terms of this agreement  which matures in january  we receive three month libor and pay a fixed rate of
