in germany we also provide customized security software solutions to customers primarily in the healthcare space today 
sales and marketing we sell our software  web based services and telehealth products and services through a direct sales effort and reseller arrangements 
our resellers typically receive a commission based on a percentage of the value of customer agreements we enter into due to their efforts 
in cases where our contracts have a term exceeding one year  we generally defer revenue derived from these contracts and recognize it over the life of the contract 
supply relationships we use at t  inc  to provide and maintain a secure hosting center at a facility in new york to host our web based services  including the usps epm service 
we also use a hosting center in europe to maintain a secure data center for our overseas operations 
we believe that there are sufficient alternative suppliers of these services 
we augment our own staff of software developers by using third party consultants and our software and services incorporate products and services which we license from unaffiliated third parties 
we also use a contract manufacturer to assemble our electronic house call telehealth monitor and several suppliers for various component parts 
we believe that adequate alternative suppliers of these products and services exist on commercially reasonable terms so as to mitigate any adverse impacts caused by the termination of any of our existing relationships 
competition we compete in markets for our workflow management software and web based services and our telehealth products and services that are highly competitive and rapidly changing 
although we believe there is no single 
table of contents company that directly competes with our content authentication services and solutions  we are aware of efforts by other companies to develop products or services to either compete directly with our services  solutions  and products or that could be used as alternatives to our offerings 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our services and solutions include features such as ease of use  quality reliability of our offerings  scalability  features and functionality  customer service and support and price 
although we believe that our services  solutions and products compete favorably in respect of all these factors  there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current or potential competitors 
these companies offer fax products  web based processing of medical forms  signature solutions and patient monitoring products and services that could compete with our services  solutions and products 
in addition  companies with which we do not presently directly compete may become competitors in the future through their product development in the area of secure online services and telehealth services and such companies may have greater financial  technological  and marketing resources than we do 
therefore  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards and customer requirements 
many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means 
if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers  the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished 
new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure 
we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
in addition  our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors 
the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business 
patents and trademarks presently  we have two issued us patents and one issued foreign patent 
in addition  we have three us  and one foreign application pending relating to the technology and business processes underlying our services and applications 
however  some of the technology embodied in some of our current products cannot be patented 
we have registered the trademarks authentidate  inscrybe  inscrybe office and carecert in the us  the trademark authentidate in canada  germany  mexico and in the european community  inscrybe in the european community and inscrybe office  and a number of other trademarks as madrid protocol international registrations 
we have also sought to register a number of additional trademarks in the us and certain foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that any patents or registrations will be issued or that any such patents or registrations that do issue will be effective to protect our products and services or trademarks from duplication by other manufacturers or developers or to prevent our competitors from offering similar products and services 
research and development the market for our software  services and products is characterized by rapid technological change involving the application of a number of advanced technologies  including those relating to computer hardware and software  communication technologies  mass storage devices  electronic signatures  content authentication and other related technologies 
our ability to be competitive depends upon our ability to anticipate and effectively react to technological changes  changing market conditions and the requirements of our customers

table of contents our product development activities are focused on enhancing our applications and services and developing new application and services to address customer and market needs 
current development efforts are focused on enhancing our current applications and services and developing additional applications for the healthcare market 
we capitalize software development costs and amortize those costs in accordance with our policy disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
intellectual property other companies operating in our market may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise obtain access to our know how 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation which may be necessary to enforce or defend our rights under any patent 
although we believe that the software  services and products we sell do not and will not infringe upon the patents or violate the proprietary rights of others  it is possible that such infringement or violation has occurred or may occur 
in the event that the software  services and products we sell are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could be required to modify our offerings or obtain a license for the use and or sale of such products 
there can be no assurance that  in such an event  we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions  or at all  and the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
in addition  if our current or proposed offerings are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could  under certain circumstances  become liable for damages or subject to an injunction  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
it is our policy to investigate allegations of third party intellectual property rights to the extent that they are brought to our attention or to the extent that we become independently aware of such third party intellectual property rights to ensure that our current and proposed software and services do not infringe on any such rights 
although we have not received notice of any other claims that our software or services are infringing  we can not provide any assurances that our software or services do not infringe upon any other patents  including the patents that we have investigated 
employees at june   we employed full time employees throughout our operations  including our senior management 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
in the normal course of business  we also use part time employees and contract with third parties to provide support for various projects 
government regulation government matters compliance with federal  state  local  and foreign laws  including laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations  or competitive position 
although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of our operations  no assurance can be given such laws  or any future laws enacted  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
government regulation of medical devices government authorities in the united states at the federal  state and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution  sampling  marketing  and import and export of medical devices 
in april  we received market clearance of the telehealth device marketed by our joint venture 
various federal  state  local and foreign statutes and regulations also govern testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  distribution and record keeping related to such products and their marketing 
the process of obtaining these approvals and clearances  and the subsequent process of maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal  state  
table of contents local  and foreign statutes and regulations  can require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources 
in addition  statutes  rules  regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals 
under the federal food drug and cosmetic act  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  class ii or class iii 
the classification of a device into one of these three classes generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness 
class i and ii devices must be able to demonstrate safety and efficacy by adhering to a set of general controls  including compliance with the applicable portions of the fda s quality system regulation  which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements  facility registration  device listing and product reporting of adverse medical events  truthful and non misleading labeling  and promotion of the device only for its cleared or approved intended uses 
class ii devices are also subject to these general controls  and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device 
review and clearance by the fda for these devices is typically accomplished through the k pre market notification procedure 
when k clearance is sought  a sponsor must submit a pre market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class ii device for example  a device previously cleared through the k pre market notification process 
if the fda agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device  then k clearance to market will be granted 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or could require pre market approval  or pma 
the fda has categorized our telehealth product as a class ii device 
both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed  manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations 
the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices  labeling and record keeping  and manufacturers required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices 
device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the fda for compliance with the quality system regulation  which sets forth the current good manufacturing practice requirements that govern the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging  servicing  labeling  storage  installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use 
fda regulations prohibit the advertising and promotion of a medical device for any use outside the scope of a k clearance or pma approval or for unsupported safety or effectiveness claims 
although the fda does not regulate physicians practice of medicine  the fda does regulate manufacturer communications with respect to off label use 
if the fda finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with fda laws and regulations or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk  it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or pma approvals already granted  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to require repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device 
fraud and abuse laws in the united states  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  which  among other things  prohibit the offer or acceptance of remuneration intended to induce or in 
table of contents exchange for the purchase of products or services reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and the submission of false or fraudulent claims with the government 
these laws include the federal anti kickback statute  the false claim act and comparable state laws 
these laws regulate the activities of entities involved in the healthcare industry by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements such entities may have with healthcare providers who use or recommend the use of medical products including for example  sales and marketing programs  advisory boards and research and educational grants 
in addition  in order to ensure that healthcare entities comply with healthcare laws  the office of inspector general  or oig  of the us department of health and human services recommends that healthcare entities institute effective compliance programs 
to assist in the development of effective compliance programs  the oig has issued model compliance program guidance  or cpg  materials for a variety of healthcare entities which  among other things  identify practices that may implicate the federal anti kickback statute and other relevant laws and describes elements of an effective compliance program 
violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties  damages  imprisonment  fines  exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  created penalties for healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters 
the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program  including private payors 
the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits  items or services 
individually identifiable health information is subject to an array of federal and state regulation 
federal rules promulgated pursuant to hipaa regulate the use and disclosure of health information by covered entities 
covered entities include individual and institutional health care providers from which we may receive individually identifiable health information 
these regulations govern  among other things  the use and disclosure of health information for research purposes  and require the covered entity to obtain the written authorization of the individual before using or disclosing health information for research 
failure of the covered entity to obtain such authorization could subject the covered entity to civil and criminal penalties 
we may experience delays and complex negotiations as we deal with each entity s differing interpretation of the regulations and what is required for compliance 
also  where our customers or contractors are covered entities  including hospitals  universities  physicians or clinics  we may be required by the hipaa regulations to enter into business associate agreements that subject us to certain privacy and security requirements 
in addition  many states have laws that apply to the use and disclosure of health information  and these laws could also affect the manner in which we conduct our research and other aspects of our business 
such state laws are not preempted by the federal privacy law where they afford greater privacy protection to the individual 
while activities to assure compliance with health information privacy laws are a routine business practice  we are unable to predict the extent to which our resources may be diverted in the event of an investigation or enforcement action with respect to such laws

item a 
risk factors as provided for under the private securities litigation reform act of  we wish to caution shareholders and investors that the following important factors  among others discussed throughout this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   have affected  and in some cases could affect  our actual results of operation and cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements made herein 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected due to any of the following risks 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
in assessing these risks  you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and related notes 
risks related to our business failure to increase our revenue and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  and had an accumulated deficit of approximately  at june  we have expended  and will continue to be required to expend  substantial funds to pursue product development projects  enhance our marketing and sales efforts and to otherwise operate our business 
therefore  we will need to generate higher revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and cannot assure you that we will be profitable in any future period 
our prospects should be considered in light of the difficulties frequently encountered in connection with the establishment of a new business line  which characterizes our business  such as the difficulty in creating a viable market  the significant related development and marketing costs and the overall competitive environment in which we operate 
this risk may be more acute in light of our disposition of our other operating segments 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitable operations in future operating periods 
our business results are likely to remain uncertain as we are unable to reliably predict revenues from our current customers or our ability to derive revenues from our joint venture 
revenue levels achieved from our customers  the mix of products and solutions that we offer  our ability to introduce new products as planned and our ability to reduce and manage our operating expenses will affect our financial results 
consequently  we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in any future period 

table of contents our capital requirements are significant and we have historically financed our operations through private placements of securities 
our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
we have been substantially dependent upon private placements of our securities and on short term and long term loans from lending institutions to fund such requirements 
we are expending significant amounts of capital to develop  promote and market our software  services and products 
due to these expenditures  we have incurred significant losses to date 
we used approximately   and  in cash for continuing operating activities for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
our available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of june  totaled approximately  we expect the proceeds received from our february private financing  in which we raised approximately  in net proceeds  revenues  the standby commitment and asset sales  to satisfy our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to attain sales levels and support our costs through revenues derived from operations 
if we are unable to attain projected revenue levels for our business  it may be necessary to raise additional capital to fund operations and to meet our obligations in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase substantially as a result of many factors  including our need to utilize a significant amount of cash to support research and development activities and to make incremental investments in our organization  our ability to achieve targeted gross profit margins and cost reduction objectives  our ability to reach break even or profitability  the extent to which we consolidate our facilities and relocate employees and assets  the success of our sales and marketing efforts  the extent and terms of any development  marketing or other arrangements  including our joint venture relationship  and changes in economic  regulatory or competitive conditions  including the current financial crisis 
our revenues may be affected by changes in technology spending levels 
in the past  unfavorable or uncertain macroeconomic conditions and reduced global technology spending rates have adversely affected the markets in which we operate 
the current recession could reduce the demand for our products and negatively impact revenues and operating profit 
we are unable to predict changes in general macroeconomic conditions and when global spending rates will be affected 
furthermore  even if spending rates increase  we cannot be certain that the market for our products and solutions will be positively impacted 
if there are future reductions in either domestic or international spending rates  or if spending rates do not increase  our revenues  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
recent turmoil in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain financing for operations or obtain credit from trade creditors were to be impaired 
in addition  the recent economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of our products and solutions  which may negatively impact our business and results of operations 

table of contents if the united states postal service cancels our new license agreement  we may need to incur additional costs in our efforts to successfully commercialize this technology 
in july  we entered into a new three year license agreement with the us postal service usps to act as a non exclusive authorized service provider of the usps electronic postmark epm 
pursuant to this license agreement  the usps granted the company a non exclusive  worldwide license to use its applicable trademarks and other intellectual property rights for the epm service in order to enable us to offer the epm service directly to the market 
the usps will define and maintain the technical and operational standards for the epm service  and serve as backup verifier for all epm transactions 
authentidate is the first provider to be authorized in a new standards based epm service model created by the usps to help ensure performance standards and facilitate the development of a multi provider environment 
we have operated the epm service on behalf of the usps since march  under a strategic alliance agreement that expired on july  this license agreement is effective as of august  and will expire in three years unless it is sooner terminated in accordance with its terms 
either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice if the other party is in material breach of any provision thereof  subject to applicable cure periods 
in addition  either party may terminate this agreement for any reason  upon days notice to the other party 
no assurances can be given that the usps will not terminate this agreement which termination could adversely affect our ability to commercialize this technology 
the usps will also have the right to terminate the license agreement upon written notice in connection with a change in control transaction affecting authentidate 
in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  authentidate is required to provide prior written notice to the usps of any merger  acquisition  restructuring  change of control  sale of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of authentidate to which the usps agreement relates  or an assignment to an affiliate  parent or subsidiary 
although such transactions do not require the approval or consent of usps  usps has the right  exercisable within days from its receipt of authentidate s notice  to terminate the license agreement 
on december   the president signed into law pl this statute defines as postal services essentially the carriage of paper and printed matter  but grandfathers other services that were being offered by the usps as of january   which we believed would include the epm 
however  the legislation further directed the postal regulatory commission prc to review non postal services within two years to determine whether they should continue taking into account the public need for the service and the ability of the private sector to meet the public need for the service 
in december  the prc determined that the usps was authorized to continue the epm as a non postal service 
we depend on growth in the software as a service market  and lack of growth or contraction in this market could materially adversely affect our sales and financial condition 
our software and internet solutions compete with other software as a service solutions 
demand for our solutions and software offerings is driven by several factors  including an increased focus on protecting business critical applications  government and industry regulations requiring data protection and integrity  and the growth in the market for software as a service 
segments of the computer and software industry have in the past experienced significant economic downturns and decreases in demand as a result of changing market factors 
a change in the market factors that are driving demand for offerings of software as a service could adversely affect our sales  profitability and financial condition 
we depend on third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our telehealth appliance  which may result in delays and quality control issues 
we do not own or lease any manufacturing facilities 
accordingly  in order to market our telehealth solution  expressmd solutions purchases finished appliances from an unaffiliated supplier 
in addition  our joint venture entity has engaged an unaffiliated third party to provide distribution services for this solution 
if the 
table of contents agreements with these third parties are terminated or if they do not perform their obligations under such agreements  it could take several months to establish and qualify alternative manufacturing and distribution partners for our products and we may not be able to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner 
we believe that at the present time  that in the event our existing third party relationships terminate  that alternative providers are available on commercially reasonable terms 
however  there can be no assurance that the future production capacity of our current manufacturer will be sufficient to satisfy our requirements or that alternative providers of manufacturing or distribution services will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the failure to identify suitable alternative manufacturers or distributors could adversely impact our customer relationships and our financial condition 
in addition  due to our use of third party manufacturers and distributors  we do not have control over the timing of product shipments 
delays in shipment could result in the deferral or cancellation of purchases of our products  which would harm our results of operations in any particular quarter 
net revenue for a period may be lower than predicted if large orders forecasted for that period are delayed or are not realized  which could impact cash flow or result in a decline in our stock price 
we have been named as a party to several class action and derivative action lawsuits  and we may be named in additional litigation  all of which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses 
an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as described in detail in item legal proceedings of part i of this annual report on form k  several purported class action complaints were filed in federal court alleging our company and certain of our current and former directors and former officers violated the federal securities laws 
subsequently  four purported shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors and former officers based on allegations substantially similar to those set forth in the purported class actions 
the expense of defending such litigation may be substantial and the time required to defend the actions could divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
as previously reported in march  the united states district court for the southern district of new york dismissed with prejudice the second amended complaint that had been filed in a shareholder class action against the company and certain current and former directors and former officers 
in april  the plaintiff filed an appeal which is currently pending with the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
our success is dependent on the performance of our management and the cooperation  performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees 
our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management team and executive officers 
if our management team is unable to perform it may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
the loss of one or several key employees could seriously harm our business 
any reorganization or reduction in the size of our employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business 
if we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  our ability to manage our business could be impaired 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  finance  and other critical personnel 
other than our president  cfo and the president of our german operation  our key personnel do not have employment agreements and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of 
table of contents company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 
if the carrying value of our long lived assets is not recoverable  an impairment loss must be recognized which would adversely affect our financial results 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights  and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment at the end of each fiscal year  regardless of events and circumstances 
in fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  for goodwill and other long term intangible assets 
as of june   we had approximately  of goodwill principally from our acquisition of our german subsidiary  authentidate international  ag 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  and we may incur substantial impairment charges  which could adversely affect our financial results 
we have incurred significant additional costs concerning our international operations and may incur additional costs in the future 
we have incurred substantial costs in supporting the operation of our german subsidiary  authentidate international  ag 
in june  we renewed for one year our employment agreement with mr 
jan wendenburg  the ceo of authentidate international  pursuant to which he will receive a base salary of approximately  euros 
further  for the fiscal years ended june   and  we advanced or made capital investments of approximately  to this subsidiary 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will recoup any of these amounts from this subsidiary 
we expect to incur additional costs in the future in connection with the operations of this subsidiary 
developing and implementing new or updated software and services and other product offerings may take longer and cost more than expected 
we rely on a combination of internal development  strategic relationships  licensing and acquisitions to develop our software and services 
the cost of developing new software  services and other product offerings  such as inscrybe healthcare and related modules  is inherently difficult to estimate 
our development and implementation of proposed software  services or other product offerings may take longer than originally expected  require more testing than originally anticipated and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources 
if we are unable to develop new or updated software  services or other product offerings on a timely basis and implement them without significant disruptions to the existing systems and processes of our customers  we may lose potential revenues and harm our relationships with current or potential customers 
new or updated software  services and product offerings will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance  which may require significant efforts and costs 
there can be no assurance that customers and potential customers will accept from us new or updated software  services and other products 
the future results of our business will depend  in significant part  on the success of our software  services or other product offerings 
current and potential customers may choose to use similar products and services offered by our competitors or may not purchase new or updated software  services or products  especially when they are initially offered and if they require changes in equipment or workflow 
for software  services and products we are developing or may develop in the future  including through our expressmd joint venture  there can be no assurance that we will attract sufficient customers or that such offerings will generate sufficient revenues to cover their associated development  marketing and maintenance costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any new software 
table of contents and services or other product offerings will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or updated software  services and product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
further  achieving market acceptance for new or updated software  services and product offerings is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by potential customers 
we do not have patents on all the technology we use  which could harm our competitive position 
presently  we have two issued us patents and one issued foreign patent 
in addition  we have three us  and one foreign application pending relating to the technology and business processes underlying our services and applications 
however  some of the technology embodied in some of our current products cannot be patented 
we have registered the trademarks authentidate  inscrybe  inscrybe office and carecert in the us  the trademark authentidate in canada  germany  mexico and in the european community  inscrybe in the european community and inscrybe office  and a number of other trademarks as madrid protocol international registrations 
we have also sought to register a number of additional trademarks in the us and certain foreign markets 
we continue to take steps to protect our intellectual property rights including filing additional trademark and patent applications where appropriate 
we rely on confidentiality agreements with our key employees to the extent we deem it to be necessary 
we further intend to file patent applications for any new products we may develop  to the extent that we believe that any technology included in such products is patentable 
there can be no assurance that any patents in fact  will be issued or that any such patents that do issue will be effective to protect our products and services from duplication by other manufacturers or developers or to prevent our competitors from offering similar products and services 
other companies operating within our business segments may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise obtain access to our know how  much of which is maintained as trade secrets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation which may be necessary to enforce our rights under any patent 
although we believe that the products we sell do not and will not infringe upon the patents or violate the proprietary rights of others  it is possible that such infringement or violation has occurred or may occur 
we have investigated patents held by third parties of which we are aware and believe that our products and services do not infringe on the claims of these patents 
although we have not received notice of any other claims that our products or services are infringing  we cannot provide any assurances that our products and services do not infringe upon any third party patents  including the patents we have investigated 
in the event that products we sell or services we provide are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could be required to modify our products and or services or obtain a license for the manufacture  use and or sale of such products and services 
there can be no assurance that  in such an event  we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions  or at all  and the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to defend against a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
in addition  if our products  services or proposed products or services are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could  under certain circumstances  become liable for damages or subject to an injunction  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we currently derive a majority of our revenues from a few software and service offerings  any decline in demand for these offerings could severely harm our ability to generate revenues 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues from a limited number of software and service offerings 
in addition  our focus on building our business is concentrated on markets for software and services where content integrity  workflow automation  electronic signatures and time and date stamping are important to customers 
as 
table of contents a result  we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for these offerings  whether as a result of competition  product obsolescence  technological change  customer spending  or other factors 
if our revenues derived from our software and service offerings were to decline significantly  our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
additionally  for the year ended june  we reported that two customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
as a result  if our relationships with these or other significant customers were disrupted we could lose a significant percentage of our anticipated revenues which could have material adverse effect on our business 
some of our software and service offerings have long and unpredictable sales cycles  which may impact our quarterly operating results 
transactions for some of our software and service offerings require customers to undertake customized installations to integrate the solutions into their legacy systems and require them to modify existing business practices 
the period from our initial contact with a potential customer until the execution of an agreement is difficult to predict and can be in excess of six months 
the sales cycles for these transactions can be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the need to educate potential customers about our software and service offerings  the timing of customers budget cycles  delays caused by customers internal review processes  customers willingness to invest resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our offerings  and for sales to government customers  governmental regulatory  approval and purchasing requirements 
we are unable to control or influence many of these factors 
further  we have experienced delays in the pace of adoption and use by our customers of our transaction based offerings  such as inscrybe healthcare  which has adversely affected our earnings 
we may experience similar delays with our other products and services and products and services currently under development 
during the sales cycle and the implementation period  we may expend substantial time  effort and money preparing contract proposals  negotiating contracts and implementing solutions without receiving any related revenue 
in addition  many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  including personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs 
accordingly  our inability to generate sufficient revenues from these offerings has a direct impact on our results of operations 
the failure to properly manage our growth could cause our business to lose money 
we are expanding our sales and marketing efforts in order to develop and pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this growth is expected to place a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement these systems and controls  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be materially and adversely affected 
our software and web based services and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our software and web based services  we may be affected by such efforts in the future 
further  despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical 
table of contents break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems  resulting in the potential misappropriation of our proprietary information or interruptions of our services 
any compromise of our security  whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with  could substantially disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and reduce demand for our services 
performance problems with our systems or system failures could cause us to lose business or incur liabilities 
our customer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we experience transmission delays or failures or loss of data in the systems we use to provide services to our customers  including transaction related services 
these systems are complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that problems will not occur or that they will be detected and corrected promptly if they do occur 
in providing these services  we rely on internal systems as well as communications and hosting services provided by third parties  such as the internet 
to operate without interruption  both we and the service providers we use must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past  and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur again 
in the event of a catastrophic event at one of our data centers or any third party facility we use  we may experience an extended period of system unavailability  which could negatively impact our business 
further  if such an event caused the loss of stored data  it could have a material adverse impact on our business or cause us to incur material liabilities 
although we maintain insurance for our business  we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur or that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
in addition  some of our web based services may  at times  be required to accommodate higher than expected volumes of traffic 
at those times  we may experience slower response times or system failures 
any sustained or repeated interruptions or disruptions in these systems or slow down in their response times could damage our relationships with customers 
further  the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased usage  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it which could harm its reliability and performance 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users of services and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services 
we are subject to product liability risks associated with the production  marketing and sale of products used in the healthcare industry 
the production  marketing and sale of devices used in the health care industry have inherent risks of liability in the event of product failure or claim of harm caused by product operation 
furthermore  even meritless claims of product liability may be costly to defend against 
the commercialization of the telehealth device exposes us to such claims 
these types of product liability claims may result in decreased demand for this product  injury to our reputation  related litigation costs  and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage  and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost 
our inability to obtain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could inhibit the 
table of contents commercialization of any products that we develop 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our products or processes  then our liability could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and our total assets 
we need to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements applicable to our telehealth product and our ability to generate revenue from this product is subject to our ability to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from payors of healthcare costs 
the regulatory clearance for our telehealth product provides for its use for its intended purposes 
in addition  the manufacturing  labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion  distribution and record keeping for approved products are subject to extensive regulation 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use or we otherwise fail to comply with other fda regulations  we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions  including a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine  suspensions  loss of regulatory clearance  product recalls or product seizures 
in the more egregious cases  criminal sanctions  civil penalties  or disgorgement of profits are possible 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems may also result in restrictions on the marketing of our products  and could include voluntary or mandatory recall or withdrawal of products from the market 
further  we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we will not be permitted to market our products and our business would suffer 
in addition  our ability to commercialize our telehealth product successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of this product are obtained by us or by our direct customers from governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental payors is critical to the success of medical technology device companies as the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from this product and our profitability 
in addition  given ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the united states congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform and the reform of the medicare and medicaid payment systems 
while we cannot predict whether any proposed cost containment measures will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could reduce the price that we receive for our telehealth product in the future 
we cannot predict the outcomes of any of legislative or regulatory efforts at reducing costs of providing health care and negative trends in this regard may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our software and service and other products offerings may not be accepted by the market  which would seriously harm our business 
demand and market acceptance for our currently available software and service and other product offerings remain subject to a high level of uncertainty 
achieving widespread acceptance of these or future offerings will continue to require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create and maintain brand recognition and customer demand for such offerings 
demand for our software and services depend on  among other things the perceived ability of our offerings to address real customer problems  the perceived quality  price  ease of use and interoperability of our offerings as compared to our competitors offerings  the market s perception of how easy or difficult it is to deploy our software or services  especially in complex  network environments  the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  market acceptance and use of new technologies and standards  
table of contents the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the pace of technological change and our ability to keep up with these changes  and general economic conditions  which influence how much money our customers and potential customers are willing to allocate to their information technology budgets 
there can be no assurance that adequate marketing arrangements will be made and continued for our software and services and other product offerings and there can be no assurance that any of these offerings will ever achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance or that such offerings will be profitable 
if we cannot continuously enhance our software and web based service offerings in response to rapid changes in the market  our business will be harmed 
the software based services industry and computer industry are characterized by extensive research and development efforts which result in the frequent introduction of new products and services which render existing products and services obsolete 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a technically competent research and development staff and our ability to adapt to technological changes in the industry and enhance and improve our software and web based service offerings and successfully develop and market new offerings that meet the changing needs of our customers 
although we are dedicated to continued improvement of our offerings with a view towards satisfying market needs with the most advanced capabilities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so on a regular basis and remain competitive with products offered by other manufacturers 
at the present time  we do not have a targeted level of expenditures for research and development 
we will evaluate all opportunities but believe the majority of our research and development will be devoted to enhancements of our existing software and web based services 
if our software and web based service offerings are not competitive  our business will suffer 
we are engaged in the highly competitive businesses of developing software based workflow and authentication offerings 
these markets are also continually evolving and  in some cases  subject to rapid technological change 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our markets include performance  ease of use  scalability  manageability  price and customer service and support 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully incorporate these factors into our software and web based services and compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure we face will not harm our business 
if we are unable to develop and market products to compete with the products of competitors  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our business  including inscrybe healthcare  our telehealth appliance and service and our electronic signing solutions are relatively new business lines and although the level of competition for these offerings is uncertain at this point in time  the field of software based solutions in which we compete is highly competitive 
there can be no assurances  however  that any of our offerings will achieve market acceptance 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidations and the formation of new companies with new  innovative offerings 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their software and service offerings to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents our software and web based services are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
our software and web based services are complex and may contain undetected errors  failures or bugs that may arise when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
these offerings may be used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our software or services or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in such offerings 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors difficult and time consuming 
despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial use 
errors  failures or bugs in our offerings could result in negative publicity  returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our software or services or claims by customers or others 
alleviating these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our licenses which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect our financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
we have a significant amount of net operating loss carry forwards which we may not be able to utilize in certain circumstances 
at june   we had net operating loss nol carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  available to offset future taxable income 
under section of the internal revenue code  following an ownership change  special limitations apply to the use by a loss corporation of its i nol carry forwards arising before the ownership change and ii net unrealized built in losses if such losses existed immediately before the ownership change and exceed a statutory threshold amount recognized during the five years following the ownership change i and ii are referred to collectively as the applicable tax attributes 
after an ownership change  the amount of the loss corporation s taxable income for each post change taxable year that may be offset by the applicable tax attributes is limited to the product of the long term tax exempt rate published by the irs for the month of the ownership change multiplied by the value of the loss corporation s stock the section limitation 
to the extent that the loss corporation s section limitation in a given taxable year exceeds its taxable income for the year  that excess increases the section limitation in future taxable years 
risks related to our common stock our stock price is volatile and could decline 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
our stock price during the fiscal year ended june  traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
we cannot assure you that your initial investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements we make regarding significant contracts  acquisitions  dispositions  strategic partnerships  or joint ventures  additions or departures of key personnel  the introduction of competitive offerings by existing or new competitors  uncertainty about and customer confidence in the current economic conditions and outlook  
table of contents reduced demand for any given software or web based service offering  and sales of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general  and companies whose stock is listed on the nasdaq capital market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
additional financings could result in dilution to existing stockholders and otherwise adversely impact the rights of our common stockholders 
additional financings which we may in the future require will dilute either economically or in percentage terms the ownership interests of our stockholders 
in addition  we may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock  as well as additional classes or series of warrants or debt obligations which may be convertible into any one or more classes or series of ownership interests 
we are authorized to issue million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
subject to compliance with the requirements of the nasdaq stock market  such securities may be issued without the approval or other consent of our stockholders 
in addition  in the event that any future financing should be in the form of  be convertible into or exchangeable for  equity securities  and upon the conversion or exercise of such securities  investors may experience additional dilution 
moreover  in addition to the above referenced shares of common stock  we may issue undesignated shares of preferred stock  the terms of which may be fixed by our board of directors 
we have issued preferred stock in the past  and our board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to create and issue one or more additional series of such preferred stock and to determine the voting  dividend and other rights of holders of such preferred stock 
any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct our business 
the issuance of any of such series of preferred stock or debt securities may have an adverse effect on the holders of common stock 
since we have not paid dividends on our common stock  you may not receive income from this investment 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of our business 
the exercise of our outstanding options and warrants  or conversion of our outstanding shares of series b preferred stock  may depress our stock price and dilute your ownership of the company 
as of june   the following options and warrants were outstanding stock options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  not all of which are immediately exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock options is per share 
these stock options are employee and non executive director options 
immediately exercisable warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
stock options to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to an independent consultant which are exercisable upon achieving certain sales levels 
in addition  there are currently outstanding  shares of our series b preferred stock 
the holder of the series b preferred stock may convert these shares into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to 
table of contents per share 
accordingly  the outstanding  shares of series b preferred stock are presently convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
to the extent that these securities are exercised or converted  dilution to our shareholders will occur 
moreover  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected  since the holders of these securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than the exercise and conversion terms provided by those securities 
further  in the event the conversion price of the series b preferred stock is lower than the actual trading price on the day of conversion  the holder could immediately sell all of its converted common shares  which would have a dilutive effect on the value of the outstanding common shares 
furthermore  the significant downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock as series b preferred stock holders converted these securities and sell the common shares received on conversion could encourage short sales by the holders of series b preferred stock or other shareholders 
this would place further downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
even the mere perception of eventual sales of common shares issued on the conversion of the series b preferred stock could lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and advance notice provisions in connection with stockholder proposals that may prevent or hinder any attempt by our stockholders to bring business to be considered by our stockholders at a meeting or replace our board of directors

for a number of years  we have experienced net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities 
our principal activities during this period have focused on developing new products and services  hiring management  refining our business strategies and repositioning our businesses for growth 
although we believe we are well positioned for such growth  we expect to continue to generate net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we expand our operations 
see liquidity and capital resources 
during fiscal we have continued to take steps to refine our strategic focus  complete our core service offerings  significantly expand our addressable markets  reduce operating costs and position the company for long term growth

as discussed below we have taken steps to focus our business in these areas  however  our progress will be impacted by the timing of customer contracts and implementations and the market acceptance of our services 
over this same period our business unit in germany continued to grow acceptance for its electronic invoicing product  and focused on further penetrating the german healthcare market with its security technology offerings

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our financial statements 
we believe that the policies described below represent our critical accounting policies  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
however  you should also review our summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page f of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  software development costs  patent costs  trademarks and licenses are reviewed for impairment using an undiscounted cash flow approach whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant changes in the business climate  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
software development costs software development and modification costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized based on anticipated revenue for the related product with an annual minimum equal to the straight line amortization over the remaining economic life of the related products generally three years 
amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events such as significant changes in the business climate  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test at the end of each fiscal year using a discounted cash flow approach 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from transaction fees for web based services  software licenses  maintenance arrangements  hosting services  electronic postmark epm sales and post contract customer support services 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period over which the last undelivered element is delivered  which is typically the life of the contract agreement 
if these criteria are met  we allocate total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately which is referred to as vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe 
revenue from web based services  epm sales and post contract customer support services is recognized when the related service is provided and  when required  accepted by the customer 
software license revenue is recognized when the criteria discussed above is met 
maintenance and hosting services revenue is recognized over the period in which the service is performed 
revenue from multiple element arrangements that cannot be allocated to identifiable items is recognized ratably over the contract term which is generally one year 
management estimates preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
examples include estimates of loss contingencies and product life cycles  assumptions such as elements comprising a software arrangement  
table of contents including the distinction between upgrades enhancements and new products  when technological feasibility is achieved for our products  the potential outcome of future tax consequences  and determining when investment or other impairments exist 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make estimates on the future recoverability of capitalized goodwill which is highly dependent on the future success of marketing and sales  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized and we make assumptions in connection with the calculations of share based compensation expense 
actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 
stock based compensation we apply statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment fas r to account for employee and director stock option plans 
share based employee compensation expense is determined using the black scholes option pricing model which values options based on the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price of the option  the expected life of the option  the estimated volatility  expected dividend payments and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the options 
the company computed the estimated fair values of all share based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model and the assumptions set forth in the following table 
the company based its estimate of the life of these options on historical averages over the past five years and estimates of expected future behavior 
the expected volatility was based on the company s historical stock volatility and historical stock volatility of comparable companies in the industry 
the assumptions used in the company s black scholes calculations for fiscal  and are as follows risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility factor weighted average option life months fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of share based compensation for employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation as circumstances change and additional data becomes available over time  which may result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies 
such changes could materially impact the company s fair value determination 

table of contents concentrations of credit risk financial instruments which subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
to reduce credit risk  we place our cash  cash equivalents and investments with several high credit quality financial institutions and typically invest in aa or better rated investments 
our credit customers are not concentrated in any specific industry or business 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information

as described in greater detail in item of this annual report on form k  on september   the company entered into a standby commitment the commitment with an accredited investor pursuant to which the lender agreed to purchase senior secured convertible debentures the convertible debentures in an aggregate principal amount of up to  the total commitment amount 
during the month commitment term  upon prior notice by the company  the lender will purchase convertible debentures in the 
table of contents aggregate principal amount specified in such notice 
in the event convertible debentures are sold  the company would also issue the lender  common stock purchase warrants for each  of convertible debentures sold the warrants 
in addition  the company issued an additional  warrants to the lender in consideration of the commitment to provide the financing 
the company intends to use any proceeds resulting from the sale of the convertible debentures for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the convertible debentures will mature on the month anniversary of issuance and bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable quarterly in cash or shares of common stock priced at market at the company s option  and are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share

any offer of the securities will be solely by means of the prospectus included in the registration statement and one or more prospectus supplements that will be issued at the time of the offering 
we believe that it is prudent for the company to re establish access to the capital markets to provide the company with the flexibility to benefit from future financing possibilities 
the company currently has no firm agreements with any third parties for the sale of its securities pursuant to this registration statement 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if at all available  can be obtained on acceptable terms 
cash flows at june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities amounted to approximately  and total assets at that date were  after adjusting for the change in gross unrealized holding loss these amounts have decreased since june  by  and  respectively  as we utilized cash principally to fund operating losses  product development activities  joint venture investments  changes in working capital and capital expenditures for corporate infrastructure during the year ended june  cash used for the period also includes expenditures of approximately  for deferred deal costs and related items   for the final payment of accrued severance obligations and  to purchase  shares of the company s common stock which were retired as of march  we expect to continue to use cash to fund operating losses  product development activities and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

table of contents net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the increase in is due to the purchase of company stock discussed above 
to date we have been largely dependent on our ability to sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities to obtain financing to fund our operating deficits  product development activities and capital expenditures

we have entered into various agreements by which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the indemnified party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as intellectual property rights 
payments by us under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim 
such claims are generally subject to challenge by us and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  we have not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of june   we were not aware of any obligations under such indemnification agreements that would require material payments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have approximately  invested in high quality  short term investments as of june  we are not exposed to significant financial market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are only minimally impacted by changes in interest rates 
however  in the future  we may enter into transactions denominated in non us currencies or increase the level of our borrowings  which could increase our exposure to these market risks 
we have not used  and currently do not contemplate using  any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash and marketable securities 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at june   our unrestricted cash and marketable securities  totaled approximately  of which approximately  was invested in money market investments 
the remainder of our cash was in non interest bearing checking accounts used to pay operating expenses
