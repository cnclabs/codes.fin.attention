item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for the years ended december  and the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and uncertainties include the allowance for loan losses and impaired loans 
further information about these critical policies is described below 
certain credit risks are inherent in making loans 
we seek to prudently assess these risks and manage them effectively 
we have internal credit policies and procedures in place to reduce repayment risks 
these policies and procedures include officer and customer limits  periodic loan documentation review  and follow up on exceptions to credit policies 
we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings through a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
some of the factors we consider in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses are as follows an evaluation of the current loan portfolio  identified loan problems  loan volume outstanding  past loss experience  present and expected industry and economic conditions and  in particular  how such conditions relate to our market area  problem loan trends over a year historical time period  and loan growth trends over a year historical time period the general component of the reserve covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses 
it also reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the allowance for loan losses to verify the adequacy and appropriateness of the allowance in meeting possible losses in the loan portfolio 
in analyzing our current portfolio to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we first segregate our portfolio into loans within the scope of fas potentially impaired loans and fas non impaired loan pools 
included in our potentially impaired loan category are our current watch list credits plus any additional credits which have been past due three or more times within the past month period 
we individually review these potentially impaired loans under fas and make a determination if the loan in fact is impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when we determine that is probable that we will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
if it is found to be impaired  an allowance is established when the collateral value  discounted cash flows  or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
we recognize any impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the impaired loan with a corresponding charge or credit to bad debt expense 
the valuation allowance becomes our specific reserve for the specific loan 
we take the balance of our portfolio and add back to it any loans that were included in the potentially impaired loan category but that were found not to be impaired 
we then segregate the remaining portfolio into specific categories based on type of loan and review the groups of loans to estimate loss under fas accounting rules for loss contingencies 
we apply a specific loss factor to each category based upon our historical loss experience for each category of loans over the current two years ending december  the loss factor is multiplied by the outstanding balance in the loan category to estimate potential loss for our allowance for loan losses 
we then evaluate certain environmental and qualitative factors that are relevant to our portfolio and make a risk assessment of low  medium  or high for each factor 
an additional loss factor is assigned to the portfolio according to the risk assessment 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 
bank regulators also periodically review the loan portfolio and other assets to assess their quality  and we employ independent  third party loan reviewers as well 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to provide for expected losses in the loan portfolio  but there are no assurances that it will be 
overview the company was incorporated as a virginia stock corporation on march   primarily to own and control all of the capital stock of the bank 
the bank opened for business on may  there are currently eight full service branch locations  operating in various locations throughout the cities of roanoke and salem  town of vinton  and the county of roanoke 
the company also operates a wealth management subsidiary  valley wealth management services  inc which markets investment and insurance products 
net income derived from this subsidiary is not significant at this time 
the company s investment in the bank was million as of december   and million as of december  performance summary for the year ended december   valley financial reported net income of  compared with  for the same twelve months of  a decrease 
our earnings for the year produced an annualized return on average total assets of and an annualized return on average shareholders equity of  compared to prior year ratios of and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were down from in to in fiscal year was a difficult year for the financial services industry as a whole  and in particular  the fourth quarter was the most challenging in our company s history 
the severe economic downturn is taking its toll on many of our business customers  especially those in the automobile and real estate industries  and there is no quick fix for the credit quality issues that are plaguing the financial services industry 
as a result  we feel it is only prudent to take a more aggressive approach in our overall provisioning for loan and lease losses as we head into the company s earnings for were adversely affected by specific and general reserves taken in response to the unprecedented turbulence in the financial markets and economy that continue to impact asset quality 
the company s loan loss provision was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period last year 
we remain confident in our ability to navigate through the effects of the current economic and financial environment 
the company s already strong capital base was enhanced during the fourth quarter of by  in proceeds from the tarp treasury capital purchase program 
the company s total risk based capital ratio was at december  compared to at september  this ratio is well in excess of the regulatory minimum to be categorized as well capitalized 
we have already begun the implementation of our strategic initiatives to deploy this new capital in the form of new lending to businesses and individuals  including an increased emphasis on home mortgage lending 
in addition to our lending initiatives  we plan to continue to pursue opportunities to support the mortgage industry through our investment in high quality mortgaged backed securities and to support municipalities through our investment in their general obligation debt instruments 
we are extremely proud that the us treasury chose to make an investment in valley financial corporation and are pleased to be among the group of banks to complete the transaction 
the capital purchase program was established by the us treasury to attract participation by healthy financial institutions to help stabilize the financial system and increase lending for the benefit of the us economy 
the following table shows our key performance ratios for the years ended december  and key performance ratios months ended months ended return on average assets return on average equity net interest margin cost of funds yield on earning assets basic net earnings per share diluted net earnings per share all percentage calculations are on an annualized basis 
the calculation of return on average equity roe excludes the effect of any unrealized gains or losses on investment securities available for sale 
calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte non gaap financial measures the company measures the net interest margin as an indicator of profitability 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets 
because a portion of interest income earned by the company is nontaxable  the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio 
tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense 
the tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for and is 
the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income  which is not a measurement under gaap  to net interest income  is reflected in the table below

we intend to continue to execute our business model by focusing on our core business and stressing personal service to satisfy customers  although we constantly evaluate the effectiveness of the model 
while our competitors may be pulling back on issuing credit  we continue to experience strong loan demand and strong core deposit growth from customers who prefer dealing with a local  established community bank 
the company issued  in preferred stock to the treasury in mid december 
as a result  during the fourth quarter our loan portfolio grew at a rate equal to over four times the growth rate for the first nine months of the year 
we recorded  in net loan growth for the quarter as compared to  for the first three quarters of combined 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million or over the million level at december   which is primarily attributable to the issuance of preferred stock and warrants to the treasury

we earned net income of million for the year ended december   equivalent to the million reported for the same period in net income for the three months ended december  was million  an increase of million over the million reported for the fourth quarter of net interest income net interest income is our principal source of earnings and is calculated as the amount by which loan and investment earning assets income exceeds the interest expense on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
changes in the interest rate environment and the company s cost of funds also affect net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a million increase when compared to the million reported for december  net interest income for the quarter ended december  was million  a increase when compared to the million reported for the same period last year 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a million decrease when compared to the million reported for december  net interest income for the quarter ended december  was million  equivalent to the million reported for the quarter ended december  the yield on average loans decreased in by to from its level of in the overall tax equivalent yield on earning assets was for the year ended  as compared to for the year ended the yield on average loans increased in by to from its level of in the overall tax equivalent yield on earning assets was for the year ended  as compared to for the prior year 
the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december   up basis points compared to the reported for the same period last year 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter was up basis points as compared to in the fourth quarter of last year 
we continue to be pleased with the positive movement in our net interest margin during this period of considerable pressure due to the significant reduction in the fed funds rate during as well as increased intense competition for deposits 
many of our competitors are struggling to meet funding and liquidity needs and  as a result  continue to raise deposits at inflated costs  despite the declining interest rate environment 
the following table presents the major categories of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity with corresponding average balances  related interest income or expense  and resulting yields and rates for the periods indicated

loan interest income includes loan fees of million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
nontaxable interest income is adjusted to its fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of percent 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income tax equivalent basis by average total earning assets 
non accrual loans are included in the above yield calculation 
as discussed above  the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities referred to as volume change as well as by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds referred to as rate change 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amounts of change attributable to variations in volumes and rates 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and rate  respectively

this risk can take one or more of several forms repricing risk comes from timing mismatches in the ability to alter contractual rates earned on financial assets held or paid on interest bearing liabilities basis risk refers to changes in the underlying relationships between market rates or indices  which result in a narrowing of the spread earned on a loan or investment relative to its cost of funds 
option risk arises from embedded options in many financial instruments such as o interest rate options  o loan prepayment options  o deposit early withdrawal options  o callable federal home loan bank advances  and o pre payment of the underlying collateral of asset backed securities 
embedded options are complex risk positions that are difficult to predict and offset  and are a large component of our overall interest rate risk 
we have established risk measures  limits  policy guidelines and internal control mechanisms for managing our overall asset liability management position 
the responsibility for interest rate risk control resides with management  with oversight by the board of directors and the asset liability oversight committee 
we seek to balance the return potential of the asset liability management position against the desire to limit volatility in earnings 
at least quarterly  we measure the asset liability management position using earnings simulation modeling to estimate what assets and liabilities would re price  and to what extent  within a one year period in response to an immediate and basis point change in the prime rate  as well as in response to more gradual interest rate changes 
our objective is to keep the change in net interest income over twelve months at or below under an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario and to keep the change in net income at or below  under an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario 
the model also incorporates management s forecasts for balance sheet growth  noninterest income and noninterest expense 
the interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management s view of future market movements 
rather  these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may apply to our earnings 
modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the simulation model 
while the earnings sensitivity analysis incorporates management s best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements  the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact likely will differ from that projected 
we also estimate interest sensitivity by calculating the net present value of the balance sheet s cash flows or the residual value of future cash flows ultimately due to shareholders 
this calculation is known as economic value of equity or eve and is generally considered a better measure of long term interest sensitivity than the interest rate shock scenarios 
our objective is for the result to change or less in an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario 
the following table shows the sensitivity of the company s balance sheet at the date indicated  but is not necessarily indicative of the position on other dates

such derivatives are used as part of the asset liability management process and are linked to specific assets  and have a high correlation between the contract and the underlying item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedge period 
noninterest income noninterest income is made up of several categories as shown in the following table in s months ended months ended increase decrease service charges on deposits income earned on life insurance contracts other income realized securities gains losses total noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts consist of a variety of charges imposed on demand deposits  interest bearing deposits and savings deposit accounts 
these include  but are not limited to  the following demand deposit monthly activity fees  service charges for checks for which there are non sufficient funds or overdraft charges  atm transaction fees  and debit card transaction fees the principal factors that may affect current or future income for service charges on deposit accounts are internally generated growth  acquisitions of other banks branches or de novo branches  and adjustments to service charge structures other income consists of several categories  primarily the following fees for the issuance of official checks  fees for wire transfers  safe deposit box rent  income from the sale of customer checks  income on real estate loans  extension fees  insurance premiums  and letter of credit fees levels of income derived from these categories vary 
for example  general market conditions and new insurance premiums purchased affect the income earned on bank owned life insurance 
fees for the issuance of official checks and customer check sales tend to grow as new branches are added 
fee schedules  while subject to change  generally do not alone yield a significant or discernable increase in income when they change 
noninterest expense months ended months ended increase in s decrease compensation occupancy equipment data processing advertising and marketing insurance audit fees legal fees franchise tax expense business manager deposit expense loan expense computer software foreclosed asset expenses  net other expense total noninterest expense as can be seen from the table above  noninterest expense increased by a total of million or from december  to december  a few items to note are as follows our compensation expense has increased due to the officer merit increases that were effective january  as well as the addition of several new lending related positions during the first half of this year and the addition of our director of internal audit in late occupancy and equipment expenses have increased primarily due to the renovation of the th floor of our main headquarters 
we took occupancy of this floor in february we also opened our new full service branch office in south roanoke in september advertising and marketing expenses are up due to the television and radio advertising campaign for our new checking account product  my lifestyle checking 
data processing expenses are up due to the conversion to an image item processing environment in mid we experienced significant decreases in our audit fees as a result of the movement of our internal audit function from an outsourced environment to internal at the end of however  due to the significantly increased compensation costs associated with running an in house internal audit department  we made the strategic decision to move back to an outsourced model beginning january therefore  we will see an increase in audit fees for as compared to but we anticipate total savings from this move of approximately  for as compared to what it would have been had we remained with an in house model 
our legal fees actually decreased year over year due to the significant legal fees associated with the work out credits in our deposit expenses have increased primarily due to the addition of two new deposit products that incur program fees on a monthly basis 
the cdars and my lifestyle checking program fees contributed to  in expenses 
the increase in loan expense is related to the special assets consultant we hired during the first quarter of to assist with the work out of our problem assets 
computer software expenses have increased primarily due to software costs associated with our new checking account product  as well as costs associated with a new loan documentation system 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million over the same period ended december  for the year ended december   we experienced an increase in compensation expenses due to new positions and a decrease in amortized salary deferrals due lower loan growth in we occupied two new floors at our main headquarters in early resulting in an increase in occupancy expense over the prior period 
there was an increase in data processing expense based on the bank s conversion to an image item processing environment 
we incurred a significant increase in legal fees related to problem credit relationships 
additionally  our insurance expense increased due to the significant increase in fdic assessment rates which went into effect january  noninterest expenses are expected to continue to increase as a direct result of business growth  expansion and complexity of banking operations  and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  which imposes additional management and reporting burdens on reporting companies such as this one 
income taxes during and  the company recorded federal income tax provision in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
the anticipated federal income tax liability equates to an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
factors contributing to the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate of percent include historical tax credits  tax exempt interest income on municipal securities  net of disallowance  and tax exempt income earned on bank owned life insurance 
during we recognized three separate federal tax credits resulting in a reduction in income tax expense of for earning assets average earning assets were million at december   an increase of million or over million at december  total average earning assets were of total average assets at december  average loans represented the largest component of average earning assets and increased million or to million at december  average loans were of average earning assets and of average total assets as of december  average investment securities  increased by million or over december  average investment securities were of average earning assets and of average total assets as of december  average earning assets were million at december   an increase of million or over million at december  total average earning assets were of total average assets at december  average loans represented the largest component of average earning assets and increased million or to million at december  average loans were of average earning assets and of average total assets as of december  average investment securities  increased by million or over december  average investment securities were of average earning assets and of average total assets as of december investment securities our investment portfolio is used both for investment income and liquidity purposes

the loan portfolio primarily consists of commercial  real estate including real estate term loans  construction loans and other loans secured by real estate and loans to individuals for household  family and other consumer purposes 
we adjust the mix of lending and the terms of our loan programs according to economic and market conditions  asset liability management considerations and other factors 
loans typically are made to businesses and individuals located within our primary market area target range  most of whom maintain deposit accounts with the bank 
there is no concentration of loans exceeding of total loans that is not disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements or discussed below

commercial loans generally are made to provide operating lines of credit  to finance the purchase of inventory or equipment  and for other business purposes 
the credit worthiness of the borrower is analyzed and re evaluated on a periodic basis 
most commercial loans are secured with business assets such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
even with substantial collateral  such as all the assets of the business and personal guarantees  commercial lending involves considerable risk of loss in the event of a business downturn or failure of the business 
commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate construction and commercial real estate mortgages represent interim and permanent financing of commercial properties that are secured primarily by real estate 
the company prefers to make commercial real estate loans secured by owner occupied properties 
these borrowers are engaged in business activities other than real estate  and the primary source of repayment is not solely dependent on conditions in the real estate market 
real estate construction loans 
real estate construction loans represent interim financing on residential and commercial properties under construction  and are secured by real estate 
this category also includes acquisition and development financing for residential and commercial projects 
once construction is completed and the loan becomes permanent  the loans are reclassified as either commercial real estate loans  which are secured by commercial property  or residential real estate loans  which are secured by first deeds of trust 
residential real estate loans 
residential real estate loans are secured by deeds of trust on family residential properties 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the company usually limits the final maturity of residential real estate loans held for its own portfolio to years  although exceptions are made for competitive reasons and under special programs 
residential real estate lending involves risk elements when there is lack of timely payment and or a decline in the value of the collateral 
loans to individuals 
we offer various secured and unsecured consumer loans  including unsecured personal loans and lines of credit  automobile loans  deposit account loans  installment and demand loans  letters of credit  and home equity loans 
asset quality summary of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  although there can be no assurance that this will be so 
the provision for loan losses increases the allowance  and loans charged off net of recoveries reduce the allowance 
a provision for loan losses of million was made during  an increase of million or from the million provided during the increase in the loan loss provision is a result of the following factors an overall increase in our general reserves of million due to loan growth as well as due to a change in our methodology related to the calculation of the historical loss factor used in the analysis 
in previous years  we have used a historical loss factor based upon the average loss per category over the five year period ending with the current fiscal year 
due to the current economic environment  we changed our methodology to use a historical loss factor based upon the average loss per category over the two year period ending with the current fiscal year 
additionally  our general reserves were impacted by a change in our risk assessment of the fas environmental factors 
as compared to december   we have increased our risk assessment on four out of seven factors  including volume of loans  trends in credit quality  current industry conditions  and local economic environment 
an increase in our specific reserves on our impaired assets of million 
the increase is attributable to one large commercially oriented credit relationship 
we anticipate provisioning levels to continue to be elevated for and the levels will depend on the depth and length of the current recession 
for the year ended december   our non performing assets to total assets ratio increased from at december  to 
additionally  our ratio of loans past due more than days to total loans increased from at december  to at december  net charge offs for the year ended december  amounted to million in comparison to million for the year ended december the allowance for loan losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was approximately at december   which compares to approximately of total loans at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are primarily based on our historical loss experience  portfolio concentrations  evaluation of individual loans and economic conditions 
a total of million in specific reserves was included in the balance of the allowance for loan losses as of december  for impaired loans  which compares to a total of million as of december  a provision for loan losses of million was made during  a decrease of million or from the million provided during the decrease in the loan loss provision is a result of a decrease in loan growth as well as the resolution of our three large problem credits subsequent to year end

nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and foreclosed repossessed property 
a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status when collection of all principal or interest is deemed unlikely 
a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status automatically when principal or interest is past due days or more  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of being collected 
in this case  the loan will continue to accrue interest despite its past due status 
a restructured loan is a loan in which the original contract terms have been modified due to a borrower s financial condition or there has been a transfer of assets in full or partial satisfaction of the loan 
a modification of original contractual terms is generally a concession to a borrower that a lending institution would not normally consider 
a loan is impaired  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas creditor accounting rules for impaired loans when  based on current information and events  it is likely that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts  including both principal and interest  due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
nonperforming assets for the five years ended december  are detailed as follows nonperforming assets in s december  nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more restructured loans other nonperforming loans total nonperforming loans foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties total nonperforming assets other nonperforming loans include impaired loans which are not on nonaccrual status  nor past due days or more 
loans are assigned to the watch list based upon our internal risk rating system 
there are three levels of accountability in the risk rating process 
the primary responsibility for risk identification lies with the account officer 
it is the account officer s responsibility for the initial and ongoing risk rating of all notes and commitments in his or her portfolio 
on a quarterly basis  each account officer signs a credit risk rating certification attesting to the accuracy of the credit risk ratings for the loans in his or her loan portfolio 
the chief credit officer is responsible for periodically reviewing the risk rating process employed by the lending officers 
the chief credit officer is responsible for the accuracy and timeliness of account officer risk ratings and has the authority to override account officer risk ratings and initiate rating changes  if warranted 
finally  the bank has a loan review program to provide an independent validation of portfolio quality 
this independent review is intended to assess adherence to underwriting guidelines  proper credit analysis and documentation 
in addition  the loan review process is required to test the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of account officer risk ratings and to test the effectiveness of the credit administration s controls over the risk identification process 
risk management reports its findings to the board of directors 
on a quarterly basis  the directors loan committee  composed of eight directors  will review all loans on our watch list to determine proper action and reporting of any loans identified as substandard by the credit quality review 
we believe that the above allocated reserves are appropriate for the impaired loans in our portfolio based upon a detailed review of the quality and pledged collateral of each individual loans considered impaired at each of the above referenced periods

deposits the levels and mix of deposits are influenced by such factors as customer service  interest rates paid  service charges and the convenience of banking locations 
competition for deposits is intense from other depository institutions and money market funds  some of which offer interest rates higher than we pay 
we attempt to identify and implement pricing and marketing strategies designed to control the overall cost of deposits and to maintain a stable deposit mix

the commercial sweep program involves balances subject to repurchase agreements which are reported as short term borrowings rather than deposits since they are not fdic insured 
the balance in the program increased or million from million reported at december  to million at december  the program consists of a demand deposit account from which we invest available balances daily in securities on an overnight basis subject to repurchase

our obligations with respect to the issuance of trust i  trust ii  and trust iii s preferred securities and common securities constitute a full and unconditional guarantee of trust i  trust ii  and trust iii s obligations with respect to the preferred securities and common securities 
subject to certain exceptions and limitations  we may elect from time to time to defer interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures  which would result in a deferral of distribution payments on trust i  trust ii  or trust iii s preferred trust securities and common securities

capital adequacy our financial position at december  and reflects liquidity and capital levels currently adequate to fund anticipated near term business expansion 
our capital ratios are above the required regulatory minimums for a well capitalized institution 
the significant increase in our capital ratios at december  as compared to december  is primarily the result of the company s participation in the tarp capital purchase program see tarp capital purchase program participation for more information 
we review the adequacy of our capital on an ongoing basis 
we seek to maintain a capital structure adequate to support anticipated asset growth and serve as a cushion to absorb potential losses and will continue to monitor the bank capital ratios very closely due to the impact our non accrual loans have on retained earnings and capital 
for the periods indicated  we had the following risk based capital and leverage ratios capital ratios ratio tier total leverage liquidity asset liability management activities are designed to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet loan demand or deposit outflows and  through the management of our interest sensitivity position  to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
liquidity measures our ability to meet our maturing obligations and existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for customers credit needs 
liquidity represents a financial institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds from alternative funding sources 
the level of deposits may fluctuate  perhaps significantly so  due to seasonal cycles of depositing customers and the promotional activities of competitor financial institutions 
similarly  the level of demand for loans may vary significantly and at any given time may increase or decrease substantially 
however  unlike the level of deposits  management has more direct control over lending activities and if necessary can adjust the level of those activities according to the amounts of available funds 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits at other banks and non pledged securities available for sale  at december   totaled million 
our funding sources consist of an established federal funds lines with a regional correspondent bank totaling million that had a million balance as of december   four established federal funds lines with third party banks totaling million that had no outstanding balances as of december   an established line with the fhlb that had million outstanding under a total line of million as of december   and an established line with the federal reserve discount window that had no outstanding balance under a total line of million as of december  we believe these arrangements will be renewed at maturity 
as of december   we had pledged approximately million of our loan and investment portfolio balances as collateral for borrowings from the federal home loan bank

we had no federal funds sold at december  and december  as a result of our management of liquid assets and our ability to generate liquidity through alternative funding sources  we believe we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to meet our depositors requirements and satisfy our customers credit needs 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as do the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation

sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary

the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement
