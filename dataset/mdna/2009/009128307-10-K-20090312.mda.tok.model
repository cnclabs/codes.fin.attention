overview we provide air medical transportation services throughout the united states and design  manufacture  and install medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
our divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based services cbs provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in 
hospital based services hbs provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in 
products division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the products division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
we believe that the following factors have the greatest impact on our results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbs operations than hbs operations because almost all of cbs revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to approximately of hbs revenue 
by contrast  of our costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended december   are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the effectiveness of marketing and business development initiatives  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper our ability to operate our aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for cbs operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for cbs bases open longer than one year same base transports were approximately  in compared to  in cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions for cbs bases open longer than one year were  or  higher in compared to we believe that same base transports in were also negatively affected by a third quarter spike in fuel prices which decreased road traffic volume  overall weakening economic conditions in the united states  and lost flights due to redeployment of numerous aircraft and crews to respond to hurricanes gustav and ike 

table of contents reimbursement per transport 
we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient and are subject to collection risk on services provided to insured and uninsured patients 
medicare and medicaid also receive contractual discounts from our standard charges for flight services 
flight revenue is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
net reimbursement per transport for cbs operations is primarily a function of price  payer mix  and timely and effective collection efforts 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
in addition  the collection rate is impacted by changes in the cost of healthcare and health insurance  as the cost of healthcare increases  health insurance coverage provided by employers may be reduced or eliminated entirely  resulting in an increase in the uninsured population 
the average gross charge per transport increased in the year ended december   compared to  contributing to an increase of in net reimbursement per transport in the year ended december   compared to provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care as a percentage of related gross billings for cbs operations are as follows for years ended december  gross billings provision for contractual discounts provision for uncompensated care the increase in the total percentage of uncollectible accounts is primarily attributable to price increases 
although price increases generally increase the net reimbursement per transport from insurance payers  the amount per transport collectible from private patient payers and medicare and medicaid does not increase proportionately with price increases 
therefore  depending upon overall payer mix  price increases will usually result in an increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts 
although we have not yet experienced significant increased limitations in the amount reimbursed by insurance companies  continued price increases may cause insurance companies to limit coverage for air medical transport to amounts less than our standard rates 
aircraft maintenance 
both cbs and hbs operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers oem s tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
five models of aircraft within our fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
since january   we have taken delivery of new aircraft for the purpose of replacing discontinued models and other older aircraft  as well as providing capacity for base expansion 
replacement models of aircraft typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement but lower maintenance costs 
total maintenance expense for cbs and hbs operations increased from to  while total flight volume for cbs and hbs operations increased over the same period 
during we incurred costs for engine overhauls  compared to overhauls in the increase is primarily attributed to the timing of overhaul cycles  as well as to the acquisition of cj 
the acquisition of cj resulted in an increase in the percentage of our fleet comprised of twin engine aircraft  which tend to have higher maintenance costs than single engine aircraft 
maintenance cost per hour on newer aircraft typically remains relatively constant on an annual basis 
maintenance cost per hour on older models of aircraft  however  may vary more widely on a quarterly basis depending on component overhaul and replacement and aircraft refurbishment cycles 

table of contents competitive pressures from low cost providers 
we are recognized within the industry for our standard of service and our use of cabin class aircraft 
many of our competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  we believe that higher quality standards help to differentiate our service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
employee recruitment and relations 
the ability to deliver quality services is partially dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
in september  our pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit  and we signed a collective bargaining agreement cba on march  the agreement is effective january   through april  negotiations on a new cba commenced in the fourth quarter of other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to we reported net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net income for included an income tax benefit of  due to a change in the effective state income tax rate 
net income for included a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of  with a tax effect of approximately  and an income tax benefit of  resulting from the recovery of previously expired net operating loss carryforwards 
same base transports for cbs operations were  or  lower in compared to  partly because cancellations of flights due to unfavorable weather conditions for these bases increased by  same base transports were also negatively impacted by a third quarter spike in fuel prices which decreased road traffic volume and overall weakening economic conditions in the united states 
aircraft operating expenses increased in  primarily due to the acquisition of cj  higher maintenance costs on older models of aircraft  and higher fuel costs

decrease of approximately  due to the base closures described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to aircraft operating expenses consist of fuel  insurance  and maintenance costs and generally are a function of the size of the fleet  the type of aircraft flown  and the number of hours flown 
the increase in costs is due to the following aircraft operating expenses of  related to cj s operations from january through september increase of  or  in the cost of aircraft maintenance  excluding the effect of aircraft added as a result of the cj acquisition and other aircraft added to the fleet during or during and  we have placed new aircraft into service and eliminated aircraft which were older models 
maintenance costs per hour on newer aircraft have remained relatively constant on an annual basis 
maintenance costs per hour on older models of aircraft  however  may vary more widely on a quarterly basis depending on component overhaul and replacement and aircraft refurbishment cycles 
during we incurred costs for engine overhauls  compared to overhauls in the increase is primarily attributed to the timing of overhaul cycles and the acquisition of cj

the average net margin earned on projects during was compared to in margins earned on multi mission interiors and other governmental contracts are generally higher than margins earned on medical interiors for commercial customers 
the impact of costs incurred in for development and design work on avionics and other aircraft interior configurations for commercial customers was offset in part by higher margins earned on hhl and mev units during the fourth quarter 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  for the year ended december  depreciation on assets acquired in the cj transaction totaled approximately  from january   through september  gain on disposition of assets for the year ended december   was related primarily to the sale of eighteen aircraft which were designated for sale as part of our fleet rejuvenation efforts

g a expenses also included approximately  related to the consolidation of cj s part air carrier certificate into the air methods certificate  the consolidation was completed during the second quarter of in addition  the first and second quarters of reflect incremental costs of staffing and maintaining our operational control center at corporate headquarters  which was established during the second quarter of to enable us to track flight plans and flight conditions for all aircraft and to communicate with our pilots en route 

table of contents interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  primarily as a result of regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and decreases in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the weighted average interest rate paid on variable rate debt in was over basis points lower than the weighted average rate paid in during we also paid approximately  in balloon payments on promissory notes secured by aircraft 
these decreases were offset in part by new notes and capital lease obligations of  primarily related to the cj acquisition  originated during the third and fourth quarters with variable interest rates

margins earned on multi mission interiors are generally higher than margins earned on medical interiors for commercial customers 
in addition  aircraft interiors completed for commercial customers during included some new types of aircraft in which we had not previously installed our modular interior  leading to higher engineering and documentation costs and lower profit margins 
in order to meet schedule requirements for both the external contracts described above and the significant number of aircraft interiors manufactured and installed in our own fleet during  the products division relied more heavily on outside contractors to supplement in house labor than was necessary in the prior year 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  for the year ended december  depreciation on assets acquired in the cj transaction totaled approximately  from the acquisition date through december  the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of placing three aircraft totaling  into service and the purchase of new rotable equipment and aircraft interiors

the purchase price increases per year until delivery 
the agreement provides for special incentives  including a trade in option for up to fifteen bell helicopters  with minimum guaranteed trade in values 
deliveries were originally scheduled to begin in  with a minimum of three deliveries per year 
however  due to delays in the manufacturer s processes  delivery of the first bell helicopter is currently expected in mid  with the remaining units to be delivered over approximately the following three years 
during and  we entered into additional purchase commitments for various models of bell and eurocopter helicopters 
as of december   commitments for aircraft for approximately million are still open 
deliveries under these commitments are expected from through we also have options to enter into additional purchase commitments for future years dependent upon our aircraft requirements 
prior to our acquisition date  cj had entered into two commitments to purchase eurocopter aircraft 
as of december   commitments for aircraft for approximately million are still open  and deliveries are expected from through we intend to use the new aircraft for base expansion opportunities as well as to replace older models of aircraft in our fleet 
we plan to either sell the aircraft which are replaced  use them for spare parts  or redeploy them into the backup fleet 
typically we have financed aircraft acquired under these or similar commitments through operating lease or debt agreements 
as of the first quarter of  we have received financing commitments  subject to routine credit approval and aircraft inspection processes  for over of the cost of aircraft to be delivered in if financing arrangements cannot be arranged or we are prevented from taking or decline to take delivery of aircraft under the commitments described above for any other reason  we may forfeit nonrefundable deposits of approximately million

residual value guarantees we have entered into various aircraft operating leases under which we provide residual value guarantees to the lessor 
as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  of this amount   relates to aircraft operating leases which were assumed in the cj acquisition 
no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses with respect to the guarantees  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and our actual and expected loss experience 
letters of credit in january  we entered into a  letter of credit with an insurance underwriter in lieu of increasing cash deposits on our workers compensation insurance policy 
the letter of credit may be renewed annually and reduces the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility

community based model in the first quarter of  we acquired certain business assets in georgia from another air medical service provider  resulting in a decrease in the number of bases in the area from eleven  formerly operated by either the seller or by us  to six operated exclusively by us 
in the first quarter of  we opened a new base in michigan and closed two bases  one in the midwest and one in the southeast  due to insufficient flight volume 
absent improvement in overall economic conditions within the united states  we expect continued reductions in same base transports  in comparison to levels  through the second quarter of effective january   we increased prices for our cbs operations an average of approximately 
based on the fuel derivative agreement we negotiated in the fourth quarter of  our fuel cost for is effectively capped at per gallon for wholesale purchases  and we expect fuel costs to decrease significantly from the levels experienced in hospital based model in the first quarter of  we began operations under a new three year contract  representing two aircraft  with a customer in alaska 
contracts with eighteen hospital customers are due for renewal in absent improvement in overall economic conditions within the united states  we expect continued reductions in flight activity for continuing hospital contracts  in comparison to levels  through the second quarter of products division as of december   forty eight hhl units  mev units  and three commercial medical interiors were in process

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents on an on going basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under our operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services and is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
we have from time to time experienced delays in reimbursement from third party payers 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  determinations of medical necessity  or the need for additional information 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are very complex and subject to interpretation 
we also provide services to patients who have no insurance or other third party payer coverage 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same collection rates that we have in the past 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care may be required 
based on related flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts and uncompensated care would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and record a valuation allowance for those amounts we believe are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
we consider estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in statutory tax rates applicable to the company is also recognized in income in the period of the change 

table of contents long lived assets valuation in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy  and operating conditions 
goodwill valuation the company s goodwill relates to four acquisitions and has been allocated to our community based and hospital based services segments 
annually  at december  the company evaluates goodwill for potential impairment using a two step test at the reporting unit level 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the book value of the goodwill 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit based upon the reporting unit s historical operating profit and the company s current public trading value 
estimated future operating profit for each reporting unit is also taken into consideration when determining the reporting unit s fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of economic changes and to estimate future operating profit for the reporting units 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and patient receivable collection rates  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the estimated fair values of the reporting units have historically exceeded the carrying values of the reporting units 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on the company s public trading value and on each reporting unit s historical and estimated future operating profits 
in estimating sensitivity  either the company s current public trading value or the reporting unit s operating profit would have to decrease by more than before the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
new accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities statement  which provides an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements 
statement permits an election to measure eligible items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis and then report unrealized gains and losses for those items in earnings 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the implementation of statement effective january   did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations because we did not elect to measure any eligible items at fair value 

table of contents in december the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations  statement r 
statement r establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired including goodwill  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest acquired in a business combination 
statement r also provides guidance regarding information to be disclosed to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
statement r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas 
fsp fas removes the requirement under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modifications to the existing terms and conditions and instead requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements 
this fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march the fasb issued fasb statement no 
statement  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb no 
statement amends and expands the disclosure requirements of statement and requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of derivative instruments and related gains and losses  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the statement provides only for enhanced disclosures 
therefore  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may the fasb issued fasb statement no 
statement  hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements and was effective november  adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  since this new standard codified  rather than changed  existing generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
all of our sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and notes receivable  some of which have fixed interest rates  except  outstanding against the line of credit and  in notes payable 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change of basis points in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  our cost of operations is also affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
generally  our hbs customers pay for all fuel consumed in medical flights 
based on actual cbs fuel usage for the year ended december   the impact on operating costs of an increase of in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown would be approximately  for the year 
flight volume for cbs operations can vary due to weather conditions and other factors 
therefore  the impact of a change in fuel cost based volume is not necessarily indicative of the impact on subsequent years or quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a fuel derivative agreement for the majority of our projected fuel consumption for the year ending december   to protect us against increases in the cost of gulf coast jet fuel above per gallon for wholesale purchases 
as of december   the gulf coast jet fuel spot price was approximately per gallon lower than it was at the date of our agreement
