item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the company s financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed beginning on page company products and operations the company is a leading global provider of premium products and services used during the drilling  completion and production phases of oil and natural gas development activities 
in august  we broadened our capabilities in key drilling and completion related product technologies with the acquisition of w h energy services  inc w h 
we provide a comprehensive line of technologically advanced products and engineering services  including drilling and completion fluid systems  solids control and separation equipment  waste management services  three cone and diamond drill bits  borehole enlargement services  tubulars  directional systems  measurement while drilling and logging while drilling services  coiled tubing  cased hole wireline and other complementary downhole tools and services 
the company also offers supply chain management solutions through an extensive north american branch network providing pipe  valves and fittings as well as mill  safety and other maintenance products 
the company s operations are driven principally by the level of exploration and production e p spending in major energy producing regions around the world and the depth and complexity of these projects 
although e p spending is significantly influenced by the market price of oil and natural gas  it may also be affected by supply and demand fundamentals  finding and development costs  decline and depletion rates  political actions and uncertainties  environmental concerns  the financial condition of independent e p companies and the overall level of global economic growth and activity 
in addition  approximately six percent of the company s consolidated revenues relate to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely impacted by the general condition of the us economy 
capital investment by energy companies is largely divided into two markets  which vary greatly in terms of primary business drivers and associated volatility levels 
north american drilling activity is primarily influenced by natural gas fundamentals  with three quarters of the current rig count focused on natural gas finding and development activities 
conversely  drilling in areas outside of north america is more dependent on crude oil fundamentals  which influence approximately percent of international drilling activity 
historically  business in markets outside of north america has proved to be less volatile as the high cost e p programs in these regions are generally undertaken by major oil companies  consortiums and national oil companies as part of a longer term strategic development plan 
although percent of the company s consolidated revenues were generated in north america during  smith s profitability was influenced by business levels in markets outside of north america 
the distribution segment  which accounts for approximately one fourth of consolidated revenues and primarily supports a north american customer base  serves to distort the geographic revenue mix of the company s oilfield operations 
excluding the impact of the distribution segment  approximately percent of the company s revenues were generated in markets outside of north america during finally  over the past few years  a number of factors have driven an increase in the importance of national oil companies nocs in the global energy industry 
nocs currently control approximately percent of world oil reserves and account for nearly three quarters of production 
as we look forward  nocs and their governments will likely have more control over the pace and the manner in which oil and gas resources are developed which could have implications for smith and other oilfield service industry participants 
we believe we have been successful in developing strong business relationships with nocs  which contribute a sizable portion of our revenues 
business outlook the company s results will be influenced by an anticipated to percent reduction in average worldwide drilling activity attributable to the significant economic slowdown and the ongoing weakness in global credit markets 
we believe the impact of lower activity levels will be partially offset by the addition of the acquired w h business lines and the concentration of our oilfield business base in markets outside north america  areas which tend to be more stable from an oil and gas investment standpoint 
the majority of the year over year rig count decline is expected to occur in the united states where drilling activity is currently percent below the average level reported in and will likely decline further in the coming months 

table of contents the decrease in us drilling activity is attributable to the lower number of land based programs  which are generally more sensitive to commodity prices 
customer spending in most international markets  which is primarily driven by oil directed activities  has not been significantly impacted to date 
although the long term outlook for the energy sector is favorable due to supply and demand fundamentals  the current state of the world economies could lead to further weakness in exploration and production spending levels further reducing demand for the company s products and services and adversely impacting future results 
results of operations segment discussion our business is segregated into three operating divisions  m i swaco  smith oilfield and distribution  which is the basis upon which we report our results 
the m i swaco segment consists of a majority owned drilling fluid and environmental services joint venture operation 
the smith oilfield segment is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and completion services operations  which includes drill bits  directional drilling services and downhole tools 
the distribution segment consists of the wilson distribution operations and a majority owned interest in ce franklin ltd  a publicly traded canadian distribution company

m i swaco segment revenues m i swaco primarily provides drilling and completion fluid systems and engineering and technical services to the oil and gas industry 
additionally  these operations provide oilfield production chemicals and manufacture and market equipment and services used for solids control  particle separation  pressure control  rig instrumentation and waste management 
m i swaco is significantly influenced by its exposure to the global offshore market  which constitutes approximately percent of the revenue base  and to exploration and production spending for land based projects outside of north america  which contributes approximately percent of the division s revenues 
offshore drilling programs  which accounted for percent of the worldwide rig count in  are generally more revenue intensive than land based projects due to the complex nature of the related drilling environment 
for the year ended december   m i swaco reported revenues of billion  an increase of percent over the amounts reported in the fiscal year 
approximately two thirds of the revenue improvement was attributable to growth in eastern hemisphere markets 
the increase largely reflects a percent increase in onshore business volumes  influenced by increased customer activity in the former soviet union fsu  and higher offshore spending in west africa and the north sea markets 
western hemisphere revenues grew percent above the prior year level due to the impact of new land based contract awards in mexico and higher customer spending associated with unconventional us land based drilling projects 
for the year ended december   m i swaco reported revenues of billion  an increase of percent over the amounts reported in the fiscal year 
three quarters of the revenue improvement was attributable to growth in eastern hemisphere markets  largely reflecting a percent increase in offshore business volumes related to new contract awards and increased customer activity in the north sea  middle east asia and west africa regions 
western hemisphere revenues grew percent above the prior year level due to the impact of new land based contract awards in mexico and higher customer spending in the deepwater markets of the united states and brazil 
operating income operating income for the m i swaco segment was million  or percent of revenues for the year ended december  operating profit increased million over the prior year  however  as a percentage of revenue margins were basis points below the comparable prior year period 
on an absolute dollar basis  the incremental gross profit associated with the growth in global business volumes was partially offset by higher variable based operating expenses 
several factors contributed to the operating margin performance  including the impact of a shift in business mix towards lower relative margin  land based programs which resulted in a lower proportion of premium drilling fluid revenues 
for the year ended december   m i swaco s operating income totaled million  or percent of revenues 

table of contents operating margins were percentage point above the fiscal year  reflecting incremental operating margins of percent 
the period to period improvement was primarily influenced by expansion in the segment s gross profit margins  attributable to increased business volumes and a favorable product shift associated with higher relative growth experienced in the offshore market

smith oilfield segment revenues the smith oilfield segment provides three cone and diamond drill bits  tubulars  borehole enlargement tools  drill motors  directional drilling  measurement while drilling  and logging while drilling services  as well as completions  coiled tubing  cased hole wireline and drilling related services 
approximately two thirds of the segment s business base is concentrated in north america  driven in part by the significance of increased unconventional drilling projects in the us land based market and the complexity of drilling projects which drives demand for a wider range of product offerings 
for the year ended december   smith oilfield s revenues totaled billion  a percent improvement over the comparable prior year period 
the majority of the year on year revenue growth related to the addition of the w h operations in august excluding the impact of the acquired operations  smith oilfield revenues grew six percent above the prior year level influenced by strong demand for drill bit products in key geographic markets  including the united states  brazil and the fsu region 
for the year ended december   smith oilfield reported revenues of billion  a percent improvement over the comparable prior year period 
approximately three quarters of the year over year revenue growth was concentrated in the us market as strong demand for additional rigs and related drilling equipment contributed to percent growth in premium tubular products and drill pipe business volumes 
to a lesser extent  improved diamond bit rental volumes and increased market penetration for three cone products in the united states also contributed to the year over year revenue variance 
operating income operating income for the smith oilfield segment was million  or percent of revenues  for the year ended december  the segment s operating margins were percentage points below the prior year level  reflecting incremental operating margins of percent 
the addition of w h s operations  which carry lower margins on a comparative basis accounted for the margin decline 
for the year ended december   smith oilfield s operating income totaled million  or percent of revenues 
the segment operating margins were basis points above the prior year level  reflecting incremental operating margins of percent 
the period to period operating margin increase was influenced by improved business volumes and pricing initiatives  which contributed to growth in the underlying gross profit margins 
distribution segment revenues the distribution segment markets pipe  valves  fittings and mill  safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets  primarily through an extensive network of supply branches in the united states and canada 
the segment has the most significant north american revenue exposure of any of the company s operations with percent of fiscal revenues generated in those markets 
moreover  approximately one fourth of the segment s revenues relate to sales to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely influenced by the general state of the us economic environment 
additionally  certain customers in this sector utilize petroleum products as a base material and  accordingly  are impacted by crude oil and natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   the distribution segment reported revenues of billion  percent above the fiscal year 
the majority of the revenue growth was attributable to increased demand for line pipe and other operating supplies associated with unconventional onshore drilling projects and pipeline expansion projects in the united states 
for the year ended december   the distribution segment reported revenues of billion  percent above the fiscal year 
the revenue growth was reported by the energy operations  influenced by higher us drilling activity levels and increased line pipe project spending 
the impact of lower canadian business volumes during  related to the corresponding decline in drilling activity levels  was substantially offset by project related spending in europe africa 

table of contents operating income operating income for the distribution segment in fiscal was million  or percent of revenues 
distribution operating margins improved percentage points  reflecting improved business volumes and product pricing related to line pipe expansion projects in the energy sector 
on an absolute dollar basis  operating income was million above the prior year period reflecting higher revenue volumes and improved gross profit levels  partially offset by growth in operating expenses to support the expanded business base 
operating income for the distribution segment in fiscal was million  or percent of revenues 
segment operating margins deteriorated basis points  reflecting the impact on gross profit of an increased proportion of line pipe and international project business volumes  which carry relatively lower margins  and the influence of the year over year decline in canadian drilling activity levels 
on an absolute dollar basis  operating income was million below the amount reported in  largely due to the impact of the unfavorable business mix on gross profit and higher variable based operating expenses

higher variable related costs associated with the expansion in base business volumes and  to a lesser extent  operating expenses attributable to the acquired w h business operations contributed to the reported expense growth 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  equaled million for the fiscal year 
the million year over year reported increase in interest reflects borrowings required to fund the w h acquisition and  to a lesser extent  increased working capital investment 
the impact of the higher incremental borrowings on interest expense was partially offset by the substantial decline in short term eurodollar interest rates experienced during fiscal income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december   reflecting an effective tax rate of percent 
excluding the impact of non recurring tax benefits recognized during the prior fiscal year  the company s effective rate increased approximately basis points 
net of non recurring items  the increase was influenced by the w h acquisition which resulted in a modest shift in the geographic mix of earnings towards a higher relative rate tax jurisdiction 
the effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the impact of m i swaco s us partnership earnings for which the minority partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes 
the company properly consolidates the pretax income related to the minority partner s share of us partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision 
minority interest expense reflects the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interest expense totaled million in  a million increase above the amount reported in the prior year period  primarily associated with improved profitability levels in the m i swaco joint venture

the majority of the absolute dollar increase was attributable to variable related costs associated with the improved business volumes  including increased investment in personnel and infrastructure 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  totaled million in net interest expense increased million from the prior year  influenced by the inclusion of certain acquisition related borrowings in the latter half of the effective tax rate approximated percent  approximately basis points below the prior year level 
the favorable comparison to the effective rate  as well as the us statutory rate  was influenced by the higher proportion of m i swaco s us partnership earnings and lower state income tax accrual rates 
based on the structure of m i swaco s us operations  the minority partner is directly responsible for taxes on its share of us partnership earnings 
accordingly  the company properly consolidates the pretax income related to the minority partner s share of us partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision 

table of contents minority interest expense reflects the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interest expense totaled million in  a million increase from the prior year 
the year over year increase primarily reflects the improved profitability levels in the m i swaco joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources general at december   cash and cash equivalents equaled million 
during  the company generated million of cash flows from operations which is comparable with the amount reported in on a year over year basis  the higher level of working capital investment required to support growth in the company s base business operations offset the reported improvement in profitability levels and various other operating cash flow contributors 
in  cash flows used in investing activities totaled billion  consisting of amounts required to fund acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
acquisition funding  which primarily related to the purchase of the w h operations  resulted in cash outflows of billion in the company also invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds arising from certain asset disposals 
projected net capital expenditures for are expected to range between and million  slightly below the spending levels reported for a significant portion of the planned capital investment relates to rental tool additions for our recently acquired directional drilling operations to support geographic expansion efforts outside the united states 
to a lesser extent  the forecasted expenditures relate to routine property and equipment additions to support the company s business operations and maintain the existing capital equipment base 
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled billion in cash flows from operations were not sufficient to fund acquisitions and other investing activities  resulting in incremental borrowings of billion 
the incremental cash requirements of the company were funded with proceeds from new bridge and term loan facilities totaling billion 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
cash flow generated from operations is primarily influenced by the level of worldwide drilling activity  which affects profitability levels and working capital requirements 
capacity under revolving credit agreements is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
as of december   the company had million drawn and million of letters of credit issued under various us revolving credit facilities  resulting in million of capacity available for future operating or investing needs 
the company also has revolving credit facilities in place outside of the united states  which are generally used to finance local operating needs 
at the end of fiscal  the company had available borrowing capacity of million under the non us borrowing facilities 
the company s external sources of liquidity include debt and equity financing in the public capital markets  if needed 
the company carries an investment grade credit rating with recognized rating agencies  generally providing the company with access to debt markets 
the company s overall borrowing capacity is  in part  dependent on maintaining compliance with financial covenants under the various credit agreements 
as of december   the company was within the covenant compliance thresholds under its various loan indentures  as amended  providing the ability to access available borrowing capacity 
management believes internally generated cash flow combined with capacity available under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs of the existing operations for the foreseeable future 
however  the billion bridge loan facility used to fund the w h acquisition will likely be refinanced in the bank and or public debt markets prior to the august  termination date 
management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products and businesses complementary to the company s operations 
in addition to potential external acquisition candidates  our m i swaco partner can offer to sell us their entire ownership interest in the venture in exchange for a specified cash purchase price 
under the terms of the joint venture  we are provided the same sale rights 
in the event a partner s offer to sell is not accepted  the offering party is obligated to purchase the other party s interest at the same relative valuation 
additional acquisitions  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or  depending upon the size and terms of the acquisition  may require debt or equity financing 

table of contents the company makes regular quarterly distributions under a dividend program 
the current annual payout under the program of approximately million is expected to be funded with future cash flows from operations and  if necessary  amounts available under existing credit facilities 
the level of future dividend payments will be at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon the company s financial condition  earnings  cash flows  compliance with certain debt covenants and other relevant factors 
the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock  subject to regulatory issues  market considerations and other relevant factors 
as of december   the company had million shares remaining under the current authorization 
future repurchases under the program may be executed from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and will be funded with cash flows from operations or amounts available under existing credit facilities 
the company believes it has sufficient existing manufacturing capacity to meet current demand for its products and services 
additionally  inflation has had a moderate impact on the company s financial results in the three most recent fiscal years  with the company experiencing escalation in wages  transportation costs and  to some extent  steel  petrochemical and other commodity prices during based on the current global economic outlook  management believes wages and other costs that impact our businesses will be relatively stable for the foreseeable future 
the company has not engaged in off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities  and the consolidation of the company s minority ownership positions would not result in an increase in reported leverage ratios 
the company has no contractual arrangements in place that could result in the issuance of additional shares of the company s common stock at a future date other than the company s stock based compensation program  which is discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  long term incentive compensation

moreover  the required disclosure related to the company s million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions has been omitted from the above table 
due to the complex application of tax regulations  combined with our inability to predict when tax audits in various jurisdictions may be concluded  the company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements  if any  related to its uncertain tax positions 

table of contents standby letters of credit in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  the company is contingently liable for performance under standby letters of credit and bid  performance and surety bonds 
certain of these outstanding instruments guarantee payment to insurance companies which reinsure certain liability coverages of the company s insurance captive

insurance the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company has elected to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under its insurance programs 
amounts in excess of the self insured retention levels are fully insured to limits believed appropriate for the company s operations 
self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
while management believes that amounts accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are adequate for expected liabilities arising from the company s portion of losses  estimates of these liabilities may change as circumstances develop 
litigation the company is a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental the company routinely establishes and reviews the adequacy of reserves for estimated future environmental clean up costs for properties currently or previously operated by the company 
in the opinion of management  these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business

in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventory reserves 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world 
on a routine basis  the company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market fundamentals and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 

table of contents goodwill 
the company has made a number of business acquisitions which has resulted in the recording of a material amount of goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment evaluation  which is largely influenced by future cash flow projections 
estimating future cash flows of the company s operations requires management to make judgments about future operating results and working capital requirements 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in the determination that a portion of the goodwill is impaired when the annual analysis is performed 
self insurance 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves

income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
the company recognizes tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions when  based on technical merits  it is more likely than not the respective positions will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
adjustments to the recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions may be required pursuant to the ultimate settlement of an income tax audit  the refinement of an estimate in light of changes to any facts or circumstances  or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for business combinations including the recognition and measurement of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling ownership interest purchased in a transaction

the provisions of sfas r are effective as of january  and were adopted by the company as of that date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas which addresses the accounting and disclosure requirements for subsidiaries which are not wholly owned 
under sfas  the company will be required to classify the minority interest liability reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity 
moreover  the company will be required to present net income attributable to the company and the minority partners ownership interest separately on the consolidated statement of operations 
the provisions of sfas are effective as of january  and were adopted by the company as of that date

the provisions of sfas are effective as of january  and were adopted by the company as of that date 
management believes the impact of other recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of hedging instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is managed through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts  from time to time  on a portion of its long term borrowings 
as of december   the company had one interest rate contract outstanding in the notional amount of million  which provided an average fixed rate of percent 
there were no outstanding interest rate contracts for the year ended december  at december  and  percent and percent  respectively  of the company s total debt carried a variable interest rate 
a significant portion of our borrowings at december  relate to a billion floating rate bridge loan used to finance the w h acquisition 
the outstanding balance will likely be refinanced  in whole or in part  with a fixed rate public debt issuance prior to the facility s august  termination date 
management believes that it will be able to manage its remaining exposure to variable rate debt instruments  if required  with interest rate contracts 
accordingly  significant interest rate changes are not expected to have a material near term impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts 
these contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all currency contracts are components of the company s hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
the terms of these contracts generally do not exceed two years 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding totaled million and million  respectively  and the fair value was less than the notional amount of these contracts by million 
as of december   the notional amount of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value was less than the notional amount of these contracts by million 
in some areas  where hedging is not cost effective  the company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management 
the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the company s var computations are based on the historical price movements in various currencies a historical simulation during the year 
the model includes all of the company s foreign exchange derivative contracts 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of currency sensitive instruments  calculated using the var model  was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
