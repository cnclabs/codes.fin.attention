item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a systems driven purchaser and manager of charged off consumer receivable portfolios and a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry 
we acquire receivable portfolios at deep discounts from their face values using our proprietary valuation process that is based on the consumer attributes of the underlying accounts 
based upon the ongoing analysis of these accounts  we employ a dynamic mix of collection strategies to maximize our return on investment 
market overview the united states and global economies are currently in turmoil 
in the us  the availability of credit is limited  unemployment rates are at year highs as more layoffs are announced weekly  credit card charge offs and delinquencies have increased more than in the last year  home foreclosures have dramatically increased and the housing market is experiencing a significant downturn 
these conditions present both opportunities and challenges for encore 
on the opportunities side  the increase in credit card charge offs and delinquencies which contribute to an increase in supply  combined with the challenges some of our competitors are facing in i generating sufficient returns on receivables they purchased in  when prices were high and ii obtaining sufficient capital to fund future purchases which contribute to a decrease in demand have resulted in a significant reduction in the market price for portfolios of charged off receivables 
for example  prices for fresh charge offs receivables that are sold immediately after charge off have declined from of face value in early to of face value in late we have seen similar pricing declines across all ages of charge offs and the decline is more pronounced in the resale market 
while this is generally positive for our business  as a result of the significant price decline  some sellers of portfolio have chosen not to sell and  as an alternative to selling their charge offs  have placed accounts with third party collection agencies 
as such  the impact the price reduction will have on our purchasing volumes is unclear 
on the challenges side  increases in unemployment  high foreclosure rates and the difficulties consumers are experiencing in obtaining credit may  for a period of time  negatively impact collections on receivables that we currently own or that we purchase during these challenging economic times 
despite these market conditions  during  most of the collection metrics we track have remained relatively consistent  as compared to for example  payer rates and average payment size  adjusted for the change in single payment payment plan mix  have remained relatively constant 
one change we have noted is that more consumers are settling their debts through payment plans rather than in one time settlements 
while settlement rates remain consistent  payments made over longer periods of time impact our business in two ways 
first  when payments are extended over longer periods of time rather than received up front  this delay in cash flows could result in a provision for impairment 
discounting a long term payment stream using our pool group irrs pool group monthly irrs range from to rather than discounting a one time settlement payment using the same irr will result in a lower net present value 
therefore  even if the cash received through long term payment plans is the same as the cash received through one time settlements  accounting for the stream of payments under sop may result in a provision for impairment 
second  when debts are settled through payment plans  there is a possibility that consumers will not make all of the payments required by those plans 
we refer to consumers who do not make all of their payments as broken payers 
when this happens  we are often successful in getting the consumer back on plan  but this is not always the case and  in those instances where we are unable to get the consumer back on plan  we experience a shortfall in collections 
we believe that this shift from single payment settlements to payment streams is one reason for the larger provision for impairment experienced in as compared to despite the current economic environment  we have not experienced an increase in the broken payer rate in as compared to please refer to managements discussion and analysis revenue below for a more detailed explanation of the provision for impairment 

table of contents as a result of the uncertainties presented by the current economic environment  we believe we are applying conservative assumptions when valuing portfolio for purchase and when establishing our forecasted collections 
additionally  while we believe that consumers who are currently charging off their debt when economic conditions are bad are more likely to recover faster than consumers who charged off their debt historically when economic times were good  we have not factored any such recovery into our forecasts 
when evaluating the overall  long term returns of our business  we believe that the benefits resulting from the current  lower portfolio pricing will outweigh the negative impacts from the collection shortfalls we may experience from a more distressed consumer 
however  if the lower pricing environment re attracts significant capital to our industry and prices are bid up  or if the ability of the consumer to repay their debt deteriorates further  our returns would be negatively impacted

portfolio revenue consists of accretion revenue  net of impairments  and zero basis revenue 
accretion revenue represents revenue derived from pools quarterly groupings of purchased receivable portfolios with a cost basis that has not been fully amortized 
revenue from pools with a remaining unamortized cost basis is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s remaining unamortized cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
all collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered zero basis portfolios are recorded as revenue zero basis revenue 
we account for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for certain debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
servicing fee revenue is revenue primarily associated with bankruptcy servicing fees earned from our wholly owned subsidiary  ascension capital group  inc ascension  a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry 

table of contents effective january   we revised our unified collection score ucs and behavioral liquidation score bls methodologies by extending our collection forecast from months to months 
ucs is a proprietary forecasting tool that generates portfolio level expectations of liquidation for portfolios that we have owned and serviced for more than six months 
bls forecasts portfolio level expectations based on credit characteristics for portfolios owned and serviced less than six months 
we have observed that receivable portfolios purchased in and prior have consistently experienced cash collections beyond months from the date of purchase 
when we first developed our cash forecasting models in  limited historical collection data was available with which to accurately model projected cash flows beyond months 
during the quarter ended june   we determined there was enough additional collection data accumulated over the previous several years  in addition to improvements in our forecasting tools  allowing us to extend the collection forecast to months 
during the quarter ended march   we determined that there was enough additional collection data to accurately extend the collection forecast in both our ucs and bls models to months 
the increase in the collection forecast from to months was applied  effective january   to each portfolio for which we could accurately forecast through such term and resulted in an increase in the aggregate total estimated remaining collections for the receivable portfolios by million  or  as of march  we did not extend the forecast on telecom portfolios  as we did not anticipate significant collections past months on these portfolios 
the extension of the collection forecast was treated as a change in estimate and  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  was recognized prospectively in our consolidated financial statements  effective january  in the quarter ended march   this prospective treatment resulted in a reduction in our net impairment provision of million and an increase in revenue of million 
the impact of the change in estimate resulted in an increase in net income of million and an increase in fully diluted earnings per share of  which we recorded during the quarter ended march  the following tables summarize collections  revenue  end of period receivable balance and other related supplemental data  by year of purchase in thousands  except percentages for the year ended december  as of december  collections gross revenue revenue recognition rate net impairment reversal revenue of total revenue unamortized balances monthly irr zba total for the year ended december  as of december  collections gross revenue revenue recognition rate net impairment revenue of total revenue unamortized balances monthly irr zba total does not include amounts collected on behalf of others

table of contents total revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  portfolio revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to portfolio revenue of million for the year ended december  the decrease in portfolio revenue was primarily the result of a greater impairment on receivable portfolios  offset by additional accretion revenue associated with higher purchasing volumes in compared to and  as discussed above  from the extension of our collection forecast from to months 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net impairment provision of million  compared to a net impairment provision of million in the prior year  which included a million impairment on our healthcare receivables  recorded in connection with exiting our healthcare purchasing and collecting activities 
the increase in the impairment provision in  as compared to  was primarily due to a shortfall in collections in certain pool groups against our forecast  primarily our through vintages 
we believe that this is the result of the broadening pressure on our consumers due to a weakening economy as well as to particular challenges we experienced in working certain portfolios 
as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions  as mentioned in the market overview section above  we have seen a shift in payments from consumers from single payment settlements to payment plans 
payments made over longer periods of time impact our business in two ways 
first  when payments are extended over longer periods of time rather than received up front  this delay in cash flows could result in a provision for impairment 
discounting a long term payment stream using our pool group irrs pool group monthly irrs range from to rather than discounting a one time settlement payment using the same irr will result in a lower net present value 
therefore  even if the cash received through long term payment plans is the same as the cash received through one time settlements  accounting for the stream of payments under sop may result in a provision for impairment 
second  when debts are settled through payment plans  there is a possibility that consumers will not make all of the payments required by those plans 
the impact of the broken payers will reduce our overall expected collections  which results in a provision for impairment 
this shift from single payment settlements to payment plans has resulted in a decrease in our actual collections  as compared to our forecasts  in certain pool groups 
since we expect this trend to continue  we expect that there will also be a collection shortfall against our forecasts in certain pool groups 
as such  we made downward adjustments to our forecasted collections in these pool groups  rather than assume that collections would be in line with previously forecasted levels 
these adjustments resulted in greater impairment provisions than we have historically experienced 
further contributing to the significant increase in our impairment provision  approximately million of the impairment provision in substantially all of which we recorded in the third and fourth quarters  related to the accounts we purchased from jefferson capital 
this represented almost of the impairment in those pool groups which contained jefferson capital accounts 
in comparison  none of the impairment provision recorded in was related to accounts purchased from jefferson capital 
until economic conditions improve  we may continue to experience a shortfall in collections against our ucs forecast which  depending on the magnitude of the shortfall and the pool groups that experience such shortfall  may result in future provisions for impairment 
in accordance with sop  an impairment provision to reduce the book value and therefore  maintain a level yield on a pool group s internal rate of return  is only recorded when current information and events indicate that it is probable that an entity will be unable to collect all of its expected future cash flows  or when the timing of such cash flows is delayed 
since we cannot presently determine the future impact of the current economic conditions on our collections  we cannot conclude that further reductions in cash flows are probable or that the timing of cash flows has changed in a manner that would significantly impact any pool groups internal rate of return and  therefore  have not recorded a related additional impairment 

table of contents revenue associated with bankruptcy servicing fees earned from ascension was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in ascension revenue was due to a higher volume of bankruptcy placements in during the year ended december   we invested million to acquire portfolios with face values aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million increase  or  in the amount invested  compared with the million invested during the year ended december   to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to total operating expenses of million for the year ended december  operating expenses are explained in more detail as follows salaries and employee benefits total salaries and employee benefits decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced average domestic headcount  as a result of the reduction in workforce  associated with our cost savings initiatives implemented in september the reduction in our average domestic headcount attributed to a net decrease of approximately million in wages  bonuses and related payroll taxes 
the decrease also resulted from a reduction in severance costs in the current year compared to the prior year  when we recorded a one time severance charge of million in connection with our cost savings initiatives 
the decrease was offset by a million increase in our self insured health benefit plan costs as a result of increased claims 
stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  this decrease was a result of fewer grants and the decreased fair value of stock options granted in recent years  certain grants becoming fully vested during the year ended december  and a reversal of expense due to actual versus estimated forfeiture true ups 
cost of legal collections the cost of legal collections increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  these costs represent contingent fees paid to our nationwide network of attorneys and costs of litigation 
the increase in contingent fees was primarily the result of an increase of million  or  in gross collections through our legal channel 
gross legal collections amounted to million during the year ended december   compared to million collected during the year ended december  the cost of legal collections increased as a percent of gross collections through this channel to during the year ended december   from during the year ended december   due to an increase in upfront court costs expensed associated with our pursuit of legal collections  and an increase in costs related to counter claims  offset by a lower overall commission rate  driven by lower bonus commissions paid to our law firms 
upfront court costs 
table of contents expensed were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
refer to legal outsourcing collections and related costs under supplemental performance data for further discussion of cost of legal collections 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million related to an increase in direct mail campaign expenses  driven by an increase in the cost of postage  an increase of million in ascension legal expenses due to the addition of litigation only clients and a net increase of million in various other operating expenses 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in skip tracing expenses and a decrease of million in the amortization of a previously acquired deferred revenue asset 
collection agency commissions during the year ended december   we paid million in commissions to third party collection agencies  or of the related gross collections of million  compared to million in commissions  or of the related gross collections of million  during the year ended december  the increase in commissions is consistent with the increase in collections through this channel 
the increase in commission rate as a percentage of the related gross collection is primarily the result of the mix of accounts placed with the agencies 
commissions  as a percentage of collections in this channel  vary from period to period depending on  among other things  the time from charge off of the accounts placed with an agency 
generally  freshly charged off accounts have a lower commission rate than accounts that have been charged off for a longer period of time 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased corporate legal expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  depreciation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  amortization expense  relating to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of ascension in  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december

as of december   we repaid in full the principal balance of the secured financing facility 
prior to may   we shared with the lender the residual collections on purchases made under this facility  net of servicing fees paid to us 
the residual collections paid to the lender were classified as contingent interest 
on may   we entered into an agreement with the lender under the secured financing facility to eliminate all future contingent interest payments for a one time payment of million 
this agreement effectively eliminated all future contingent interest payments and released our lender s security interests in the remaining receivables originally financed under the secured financing facility 
subsequent to the second quarter of  we no longer are required to pay any contingent interest expense under the secured financing facility 
we have financed portfolio purchases subsequent to december  using our revolving credit facility  which does not require the sharing of residual collections with the lender 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revolving credit facility 
interest on debt obligations increased million during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to an increase in amounts borrowed to fund our purchases of receivable portfolios and general working capital needs  offset by decreased interest expense on our convertible senior notes convertible notes driven by the reduced principal balance 
gain on repurchase of convertible notes  net during the year ended december   we repurchased million principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes  for a total price of million  plus accrued interest 
the repurchases left million principal amount of our convertible notes outstanding 
these transactions resulted in a pre tax gain of million  which was partially offset by a million write off of the debt issuance costs related to the portions of the convertible notes repurchased 
the net gain of million was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  other income and expense during the year ended december   total other income was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to the realization of a million gain associated with the plan assets of our non qualified employee benefit plan in the prior year 
during the year ended december   we liquidated all of our mutual funds within the plan assets 
as a result  previously unrealized investment gains of million were recognized as other income 

table of contents provision for income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an effective rate of of pretax income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   consists primarily of a provision for federal income taxes of which is net of a benefit for state taxes of  a blended provision for state taxes of  a adjustment to federal taxes payable as a result of state tax rate changes and a benefit for the effect of permanent book versus tax differences of 
the overall income tax rate for the year ended december   increased to from as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a net state effective tax rate increase in and to one time state related tax reductions experienced in in  a number of state taxing methodology changes became effective  the majority of which resulted in an increase to our net state effective tax rate 
the one time reductions in resulted from the cumulative effect of and prior years favorable state tax ruling  a net beneficial adjustment to the state and federal tax payables resulting from the completion of back state tax returns and a beneficial adjustment to deferred taxes as a result of the recognition of certain state generated net operating losses 
during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an effective rate of of pretax income

the increase in portfolio revenue was partially offset by a greater impairment on receivable portfolios  lower revenue recognition rates and a reduction in zero basis revenue 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net impairment provision of million  including a million impairment on our healthcare receivables in connection with exiting our healthcare purchasing and collection activities  compared to a net impairment provision of million in the prior year 
the increase in the impairment provision in  as compared to  was primarily due to three factors 
first  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a shortfall in collections against our forecast  a large percentage of which came from our older pool groups  which have very high monthly irrs 
second  during the last two quarters of  we experienced a trend in which a larger percentage of collections from our legal channel came from multi payment settlements versus single payment settlements 
given the high irrs in our older pool groups  when payments are extended over a longer period of time and the cash flows are delayed  this generally results in an impairment provision  even if we receive the collections in the future 
despite this recent trend in the shift in payment types from single payment settlements to multi payment settlements in our legal channel  we have not experienced any material shifts in our overall payer rates or settlement rates 
finally  since it is reasonable to assume that current economic conditions will have some negative impact on consumers willingness or ability to repay their accounts  we felt it was prudent to reduce some of our near term forecasted collections  which resulted in an increase to the impairment provision 
the lower revenue recognition rates were due to a greater portion of our collections coming from our to portfolio purchases that have lower revenue recognition rates than our and prior purchases  due to a more competitive pricing environment since during the year ended december   million exclusive of million of zero basis revenue on the retained interest was recognized as zero basis revenue  a million decrease from the million exclusive of million of zero basis revenue on the retained interest recognized during the year ended december  the reduction in zero basis revenue was primarily the result of the sale of certain receivables portfolios in from zero basis portfolios and an expected reduction in collections from zero basis portfolios 
in  we sold accounts amounting to approximately billion in face value for million 
this sale resulted in additional zero basis revenue of million for the year ended december  additionally  we expect the revenue from our zero basis portfolios to decline in future quarters as collections from these portfolios diminish 

table of contents revenue associated with bankruptcy servicing fees earned from ascension  a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry  was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the decrease in ascension revenue was due to the high volume of bankruptcy placements in october just prior to the effective date of the bankruptcy reform act the act

we do not anticipate canceling any of these commitments at this time and  as a result  have included the entire anticipated future commitment 
we expect to fund forward flow purchases with cash flows from operating activities and or borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
purchase commitments do not include the remaining purchase obligations under our forward flow agreement with jefferson capital entered into on june  subsequent to june   we ceased forward flow purchases from jefferson capital due to a breach by jefferson capital and its parent  compucredit corporation  of certain agreements

our revolving credit facility has a remaining term of years and to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our revolving credit facility  it would be due in may the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility as of december   was million 
as discussed above  effective july   we expanded the capacity of our revolving credit facility from million to million  which provides us with a significant amount of additional capital to fund our growth

table of contents inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the three years ended december    and  since inflation rates have generally remained at relatively low levels and our operations are not otherwise uniquely affected by inflation concerns 
critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios 
commencing january   we began accounting for our investment in receivable portfolios in accordance with the provisions of sop sop addresses accounting for differences between initial estimated cash flows expected to be collected from purchased receivables  or pools  and subsequent changes to those estimated cash flows 
sop limits the revenue that may be accreted  also known as accretable yield  to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over our investment  or cost basis  in the pool 
as permitted by sop  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
all portfolios with common risk characteristics purchased prior to the adoption of sop were aggregated by quarter of purchase 
in compliance with sop  we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
the interest method applies an effective interest rate  or internal rate of return irr to the cost basis of the pool  which is to remain level  or unchanged throughout the life of the pool unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally are recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s irr over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction in revenue  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  we account for such portfolios as cost recovery portfolios 
the accounts in these portfolios have different risk characteristics than those included in other portfolios acquired during the same quarter  or the necessary information was not available to estimate future cash flows and  accordingly  they were not aggregated with other portfolios 
contingent interest 
prior to may   under the terms of our prior secured financing facility  once we repaid the lender for the notes for each purchased portfolio and collected sufficient amounts to recoup our initial cash investment in each purchased portfolio  then we shared the residual collections contingent interest from the receivable portfolios  net of servicing fees  with the lender 
we made estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivable portfolios 
based on these estimates  we recorded a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense 

table of contents on may   we entered into an agreement with the lender under our prior secured financing facility to eliminate all future contingent interest payments  for a one time payment of million 
subsequent to that date  we are no longer obligated to make any contingent interest payments under the secured financing facility and as a result  no longer record such interest in our statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on contingent interest 
deferred revenue 
on august   we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of ascension 
ascension provides bankruptcy administration services primarily to holders of motor vehicle secured loans  on which the debtor has filed for chapter or bankruptcy protection 
these services are provided subject to the terms of long term contracts 
such contracts generally have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew annually 
fees for the bankruptcy administration services are charged on a per referred account basis and generally consist of an upfront fee at the time of account referral 
this upfront fee is typically coupled with either an ongoing monthly service fee per referred account or service specific fees based on a predetermined fee schedule 
the servicing deliverable for chapter accounts is focused on the completion of the entire bankruptcy process resulting in the most favorable possible conclusion for the customer 
as a result  revenue is deferred and not recognized until the bankruptcy case is closed dismissal discharge 
due to practical limitations and constraints  a historical average life of seven months is used rather than actual closure dates 
therefore  the total financial consideration less efforts applied to litigation for client contracts without a separate litigation fee schedule is recognized seven months after a referred account is activated 
chapter bankruptcy proceedings  also known as reorganization  are generally designed to restructure an individual s debts and allow them to propose a repayment plan detailing how they are going to pay back their debts over the plan period 
the responsibility of ascension is to ensure that the client s claim is recognized by the court to the maximum benefit of ascension s client  and to monitor and or collect the debtor payments throughout the confirmed bankruptcy plan term 
the average duration period for chapter bankruptcy placements is thirty five months 
given the nature and duration of a chapter proceeding  the monthly servicing deliverable provided relative to a chapter referred account is considered delivered each month and revenue is recognized ratably  including any upfront fees received by the company over time as the services are provided 
the litigation deliverable is an as incurred event  with revenue recognized based on the historical percentage of accounts litigated over the average duration of an account 
any billings in excess of the ratable revenue will be deferred 
the average duration period for chapter and bankruptcy placements is reviewed periodically for changes 
convertible notes hedge 
in  we issued million of convertible notes due september  concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  we purchased call options to purchase shares of our common stock and sold warrants to sell shares of our our common stock to the parties to which the convertible notes were issued 
in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  we recorded the net call options and warrants as a reduction in additional paid in capital as of december   and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the call options and warrants in our consolidated financial statements 
forward flow asset 
in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from jefferson capital in june  we entered into a forward flow agreement to purchase a minimum of billion in face value of credit card charge offs over the next five years at a fixed price 
we allocated million of the acquisition purchase price to this agreement  which is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as forward flow asset 
we allocate a portion of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolio purchases under the forward flow agreement based on the proportion the purchase represents to the total purchase commitment  as adjusted for the time value of money 
as part of this forward flow agreement  the seller is obligated to sell a predetermined minimum amount of charged off credit card accounts to us 
the forward flow agreement contains penalty provisions if the seller fails to meet such minimum requirements 
any monies received pursuant to such penalty provisions would be applied to the carrying balance of the forward flow asset 

table of contents on july   we gave jefferson capital and its parent company  compucredit corporation  notice of breach by jefferson capital and compucredit of the agreement under which the forward flow purchases are made and initiated arbitration as a result of the breach 
this matter is in the early stages of development and any impact on the recoverability of our forward flow asset  currently stated at million  is uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  for more information on our dispute with jefferson capital and compucredit 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related debtor has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has  to date  been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs deferred court costs 
we capitalize these costs in the consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will ultimately be uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced  or recovered  or that we anticipate recovering 
deferred court costs not recovered within three years of placement are fully written off 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we have hedged the cash flows of a portion of our long term debt by entering into two separate interest rate swap agreements  with an intention to more effectively manage our exposure to interest rate changes by establishing a set level of fixed interest rates 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedge activities  as amended fas in the second quarter of fas requires that qualifying derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative  if any  is recognized in interest expense in the period of change 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r 
under fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards  which is consistent with that used for pro forma disclosures under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
we had elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by fas r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of fas r 
the modified prospective transition method requires us to record stock based compensation expense for all new and unvested stock options and restricted stock units that are ultimately expected to vest  as the requisite service is rendered  beginning january  stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to january   is based on the grant date fair value as determined under the pro forma provisions of fas in accordance with fas r  beginning in the first quarter of  we have presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock based compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our stock based compensation 
income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or 
table of contents increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense on our statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which establishes recognition and measurement thresholds that must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
effective january   we adopted the accounting provisions of fin we were not required to record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
we have made significant estimates with respect to the rate of return established to recognize accretion revenue on our receivable portfolios and with respect to the provision for impairment of receivable portfolios 
in connection with these estimates  we have made significant estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from receivable portfolios owned 
significant estimates have also been made with respect to ascension s service revenue  the realizability of our net deferred court costs  forward flow asset  other assets  intangible assets  net deferred tax assets and tax reserve  stock based compensation  and the potential liabilities with respect to our self insured workers compensation and health benefits plans 
changes in accounting estimate effective january   we revised our unified collection score ucs and behavioral liquidation score bls methodologies by extending our collection forecast from months to months 
ucs is a proprietary forecasting tool that generates portfolio level expectations of liquidation for portfolios that we have owned and serviced for more than six months 
bls forecasts portfolio level expectations based on credit characteristics for portfolios owned and serviced less than six months 
we have observed that receivable portfolios purchased in and prior have consistently experienced cash collections beyond months from the date of purchase 
when we first developed our cash forecasting models in  limited historical collection data was available with which to accurately model projected cash flows beyond months 
during the quarter ended june   we determined there was enough additional collection data accumulated over the previous several years  in addition to improvements in our forecasting tools  allowing us to extend the collection forecast to months 
during the quarter ended march   we determined that there were enough additional collection data to accurately extend the collection forecast in both our ucs and bls models to months 
the increase in the collection forecast from to months was applied effective january   to each portfolio for which we could accurately forecast through such term and resulted in an increase in the aggregate total estimated remaining collections for the receivable portfolios by million  or  as of march  we did not extend the forecast on telecom portfolios as we do not anticipate significant collections past months on these portfolios 
the extension of the collection forecast was treated as a change in estimate and  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  was recognized prospectively in our consolidated financial statements  effective january  in the quarter ended march   this prospective treatment resulted in a reduction in our net impairment provision of million and an increase in revenue of million 
the impact of the change in estimate resulted in an increase in net income of million and an increase in fully diluted earnings per share of  which we recorded in the quarter ended march  new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standard board the fasb issued statements no 
revised  business combinations 
the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes 
table of contents the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
we will adopt this new standard for our fiscal year beginning january  in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this statement is effective prospectively  except for certain retrospective disclosure requirements  for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we expect to adopt this new standard and its required disclosures  in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year beginning january  in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that  upon conversion  may be settled fully or partially in cash  must separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this fsp is to be applied retrospectively to all past periods presented  even if the instrument has matured  converted  or otherwise been extinguished as of the fsp s effective date 
we believe that this fsp will change the accounting treatment of our current outstanding convertible notes that were issued in based on our preliminary analysis  we will retrospectively designate approximately million of the million original debt as equity  which will create a corresponding debt discount of million and therefore reduce the original net debt balance to million 
we will retrospectively incur additional interest expense as a result of amortizing the debt discount 
the estimated additional interest expense is approximately million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial instrument when the market for that asset is not active 
this fsp illustrates key considerations in determining a fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
this fsp also provides clarification  among other things  how the reporting entity s own assumptions should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant observable inputs do not exist 
this fsp is effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements as a result of this fsp 
in december  the fasb released fsp fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  which amends statement of financial accounting standard no 
r to provide guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  we expect to adopt this new standard and its required disclosures in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  
table of contents special note on forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  which we believe are subject to certain safe harbors 
many statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated into this annual report on form k are forward looking statements 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  intend  plan  will  may and similar expressions often characterize forward looking statements 
these statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of collections  revenues  income or loss  estimates of capital expenditures  plans for future operations  products or services and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to these matters 
in particular  these statements may be found  among other places  under the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business  and risk factors sections 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we caution that these expectations or predictions may not prove to be correct or we may not achieve the financial results  savings or other benefits anticipated in the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgement of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which may be beyond our control or cannot be predicted or quantified  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
many factors  including but not limited to those set forth in this annual report on form k under part i  item a 
risk factors  could cause our actual results  performance  achievements  or industry results to be very different from the results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected by other factors besides those listed here

we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new information or future events  or for any other reason even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by these forward looking statements will not be realized 
in addition  it is our policy generally not to make any specific projections as to future earnings  and we do not endorse projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had total borrowings of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  of which million was subject to variable interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of debt 
changes in short term interest rates also affect our earnings as a result of our borrowings under variable rate borrowing agreements 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase at an average of  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on the amount of related outstanding borrowings subject to variable interest rates as of december   of million 
conversely  if market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense would decrease  thereby increasing income before income taxes by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on borrowings subject to variable interest rates as of december
