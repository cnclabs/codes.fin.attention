item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview parkway is a self administered and self managed reit specializing in the acquisition  operations  leasing and ownership of office properties 
the company is geographically focused on the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
at january  parkway owned or had an interest in office properties located in states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
included in the portfolio are properties totaling million square feet that are owned jointly with other investors  representing of the portfolio 
beginning with the company s gear up plan  which started january  and ended december   it is the company s goal to transform its strategy from being an owner operator to being an operator owner 
the company will continue executing on this strategy  which highlights the company s strength in providing excellent service in the operation of office properties in addition to its direct ownership of real estate assets 
fee based real estate services are offered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  parkway realty services llc  which also manages and or leases approximately million square feet for third party owners at january  the company generates revenue primarily by leasing office space to its customers and providing management and leasing services to third party office property owners including joint venture interests 
the primary drivers behind parkway s revenues are occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
at january   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to at october  and at january  not included in the january  occupancy rate are signed leases totaling  square feet  which commence during the first and second quarters of and will raise parkway s percentage leased to 
to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include the broker bill of rights  a short form service agreement and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have helped the company maintain occupancy around during a time when the national occupancy rate is approximately 
parkway currently projects an average annual occupancy range of approximately to during for its office properties 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates has the effect of reducing market rental rates and vice versa 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms 
as leases expire  the company replaces the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate 
at january   parkway had per square foot in rental rate embedded growth in its office property leases 
embedded growth is defined as the difference between the weighted average in place cash rents and the weighted average market rental rate 
parkway currently expects embedded rent growth per square foot to decrease in customer retention 
keeping existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the customer 
in making this estimate  parkway takes into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great deal of energy on customer retention 
parkway s operating philosophy is based on the premise that it is in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with customers and stockholders 
over the past ten years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention for the year ending december  was compared to for the year ending december  page of strategic planning parkway is a focused office reit with a hands on  service oriented approach  a disciplined capital allocation program and a willingness to recycle assets 
however  we see the future transformation taking parkway from being an owner operator to being an operator owner 
on january   the company initiated a three year operating plan referred to as the gear up plan  which was completed on december  the plan served as the spring board to transform parkway from being first an owner of real estate and secondarily an operator of real estate for others to being first an operator of real estate for others that also owns an interest in the real estate 
parkway achieved the gear up plan financial goal of cumulative adjusted funds available for distribution per diluted share for the three year period 
the goals of the gear up plan and related accomplishments are discussed below great people 
great customer service starts with hiring great people  training them well and retaining them 
it took great people to accomplish the ambitious goals of the gear up plan 
parkway retained and recruited great people through expansion of the intern program  boot camp program and parachute program 
these programs are used to train our people on the culture of the company and its uncompromising focus on operations so that they are familiar with all disciplines of the company 
equity opportunities 
over the last several years management has created a broad array of equity opportunities for parkway 
on the private equity side this includes the use of discretionary funds  such as the ohio pers fund i and texas teachers fund ii  and partnerships 
the judicious use of private equity provides a greater return on equity to the public shareholders 
on the public equity side  this includes the judicious use of common equity and preferred equity to manage the balance sheet and growth 
parkway accomplished the following equity opportunities goals during through fund ii formation 
on may   parkway entered into texas teachers fund ii  a million discretionary fund with the trs for the purpose of acquiring office properties 
trs is a investor and parkway is a investor 
equity offering 
on december   the company sold  shares of common stock to banc of america securities llc at a gross offering price of per share and a net price of per share 
the company used the net proceeds of approximately million to repay indebtedness outstanding under a million mezzanine loan incurred in connection with the purchase of one illinois center and to fund our equity contributions for ohio pers fund i investments 
asset recycling 
the company has demonstrated its willingness in the past to sell assets when management believed the time was right 
at the start of the gear up plan  parkway identified buildings in markets  totaling approximately million rentable square feet to be part of the asset recycling program 
most of these properties were smaller assets or located in smaller markets that do not fit with the company s strategy of owning larger assets in institutional markets 
the dispositions that were planned would help align the company s portfolio with its current acquisition criteria  which focuses on larger properties in institutional markets 
this was a fluid list of assets based on the company s evaluation of specific market conditions and review of the portfolio 
the other side of asset recycling is the reinvestment of proceeds from dispositions into other assets  either owned in the fee simple format or owned jointly with a partner 
parkway accomplished the following asset recycling goals during through o dispositions 
parkway sold office properties for gross sales proceeds of million and recorded a total gain on the sales for financial reporting purposes in the amount of million 
subsequent to december   parkway sold one asset for a gross sales price of million and has another asset under contract for a gross sales price of million with  in non refundable earnest money 
the company plans to continue the work started during the gear up plan and complete many of the non strategic asset sales outlined previously  subject to market conditions 
page of o fund i acquisitions 
parkway completed the investment for the ohio pers fund i 
during through  office properties were purchased at an aggregate contract purchase price of million  which is comprised of investments by the fund totaling million plus an additional investment by parkway of million 
o fee simple purchases 
in july  parkway purchased one illinois center in chicago  illinois at a contract purchase price of million 
o other purchases 
parkway purchased an additional interest in moore building associates  lp  which owns the toyota center in memphis  tennessee  for million raising parkway s total ownership interest to 
o office property development 
the pinnacle at jackson place in jackson  mississippi  opened on december   at a total cost of approximately million  which includes the cost of the adjacent parking facility 
the completion of the company s only development project consists of an  net rentable square foot class a office building and a  space parking facility that is leased from the city of jackson for a period of years 
these two goals  equity opportunities and asset recycling  are what combine to transform parkway from being an owner operator to being an operator owner 
management believes that these actions will result in parkway better leveraging its core strength of operating office properties and will be advantageous for the company s shareholders over the long term 
so whether we are in an economy characterized by growth or recession  purchasing assets with a good partner and leveraging our operating expertise through earning recurring fees allows us to increase our core portfolio in larger and more institutional markets and increase our earnings potential from the services provided 
retain customers 
customer retention remains the cornerstone of the company s business 
we believe that our focus on the customer is why partners choose to partner with parkway 
the goal was a customer retention rate of to 
the average customer retention rate during the gear up plan was 
uncompromising focus on operations 
parkway reaffirmed its commitment to do that which it does best  and that is to operate office properties for maximum returns 
during the gear up plan  parkway increased occupancy from at january  to at january  additionally  embedded rent growth increased from a negative per square foot at january  to a positive per square foot at january  parkway currently expects embedded rent growth per square foot to decrease in performance 
in the planning process  management first decided what actions to take strategically over the three years of the gear up plan and secondly  modeled the economic impact of these actions 
given the large component of asset recycling in the plan  management selected a financial metric that would be most appropriate to measure the success of the plan 
this led to the adoption of cumulative adjusted fad as the metric for the gear up plan  with a target of per share cumulative over three years 
parkway achieved an actual cumulative adjusted fad for the plan of per diluted share 
discretionary funds 
on july   parkway  through affiliated entities  entered into a limited partnership agreement forming ohio pers fund i for the purpose of acquiring high quality multi tenant office properties

in addition to the total debt to total asset value ratio  the company monitors interest  fixed charge and modified fixed charge coverage ratios 
the interest coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued  principal payments made on mortgage loans and preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
the modified fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing cash interest accrued and preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
management believes the total debt to total asset value  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and modified fixed charge coverage ratios provide useful information on total debt levels as well as the company s ability to cover interest  principal and or preferred dividend payments with current income 
page of the computation of the company s proportionate share of the interest  fixed charge and modified fixed charge coverage ratios and the reconciliation of net income to ebitda are as follows for the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income adjustments to net income interest expense amortization of financing costs prepayment expenses early extinguishment of debt depreciation and amortization amortization of share based compensation gain on real estate and other assets tax expense ebitda adjustments unconsolidated joint ventures ebitda adjustments minority interest in real estate partnerships ebitda interest coverage ratio ebitda interest expense interest expense capitalized interest interest expense unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense minority interest in real estate partnerships total interest expense interest coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends principal payments excluding early extinguishment of debt principal payments unconsolidated joint ventures principal payments minority interest in real estate partnerships total fixed charges fixed charge coverage ratio modified fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda modified fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends total fixed charges modified fixed charge coverage ratio parkway defines ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  losses on early extinguishment of debt and other gains and losses 
ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
the company believes that ebitda helps investors and parkway s management analyze the company s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
however  the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities are that ebitda does not reflect the company s historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures or the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the company s outstanding debt 
although ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  the company compensates for the limitations by only using ebitda to supplement gaap financial measures 
additionally  the company believes that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required gaap measures of its performance and liquidity to improve their understanding of parkway s operating results and liquidity 
parkway views ebitda primarily as a liquidity measure and  as such  the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is cash flows provided by operating activities 
because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table reconciles ebitda to cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december ebitda amortization of above market leases amortization of mortgage loan discount operating distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense prepayment expense early extinguishment of debt tax expense change in deferred leasing costs change in receivables and other assets change in accounts payable and other liabilities adjustments for minority interests adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures cash flows provided by operating activities minority interest real estate partnerships

critical accounting estimates general 
parkway s investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  the company is generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or tenants for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc  its majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the company has a controlling interest 
parkway also consolidates subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and parkway is the primary beneficiary  as defined in fasb interpretation r consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
parkway considers critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following revenue recognition  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  page of depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue recognition 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
the cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as straight line rent receivable on the accompanying balance sheets 
when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements  the leased space is ready for its intended use when the tenant improvements are substantially completed 
in limited instances  when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements  straight line rent is recognized when the tenant takes possession of the unimproved space 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
property operating cost recoveries from customers expense reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
the computation of expense reimbursements is dependent on the provisions of individual customer leases 
most customers make monthly fixed payments of estimated expense reimbursements 
the company makes adjustments  positive or negative  to expense reimbursement income quarterly to adjust the recorded amounts to the company s best estimate of the final property operating costs based on the most recent quarterly budget 
after the end of the calendar year  the company computes each customer s final expense reimbursements and issues a bill or credit for the difference between the actual amount and the amounts billed monthly during the year 
management company income represents market based fees earned from providing management  construction  leasing  brokerage and acquisition services to third parties 
management fee income is computed and recorded monthly in accordance with the terms set forth in the stand alone management service agreements 
leasing and brokerage commissions are recognized pursuant to the terms of the stand alone agreements at the time underlying leases are signed  which is the point at which the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
fees relating to the purchase or sale of property are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured  which usually occurs at closing 
all fees on company owned properties and consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation 
the portion of fees earned on unconsolidated joint ventures attributable to parkway s ownership interest is eliminated in consolidation 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
page of real estate assets are classified as held for sale or held and used in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we classify certain assets as held for sale based on management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions to close in the next twelve months 
we consider an office property as held for sale once we have executed a contract for sale  allowed the buyer to complete its due diligence review and received substantial non refundable deposit 
until a buyer has completed its due diligence review of the asset  necessary approvals have been received and substantive conditions to the buyer s obligation to perform have been satisfied  we do not consider a sale to be probable 
when the company identifies an asset as held for sale  we estimate the net realizable value of such asset and discontinue recording depreciation on the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company records assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
fair value is based on the estimated and realizable contract sales price if available for the asset less estimated costs to sell 
if a sales price is not available  the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset for the remaining useful life are used to determine if the carrying value is recoverable 
the cash flow estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  the company would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease in net income 
in  parkway recorded an impairment loss on two contracted office property sales in the amount of million  and an impairment loss on acres of land in new orleans  louisiana in the amount of depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in an increase or decrease in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above and below market leases  customer relationships  lease costs and the value of in place leases and any value attributable to above or below market debt assumed with the acquisition 
parkway allocates the purchase price of properties to tangible and intangible assets based on fair values 
the company determines the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from customers 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our customers ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectability of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our customers  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for customer balances that are over days past due and for specific customer receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense

page of funds from operations management believes that funds from operations available to common shareholders ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the nareit definition of ffo 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to derive the company s pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures 
further  the company does not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges 
the company believes that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
however  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization  among other items  from net income  as defined by gaap 
the company believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful 
ffo as reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity

inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
additionally  most of the leases require the customers to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate
