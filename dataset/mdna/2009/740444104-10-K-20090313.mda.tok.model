preformed line products company and its subsidiaries the company  plpc  we  us  or our is an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for the energy  telecommunication  cable operators  information data communication  and other similar industries 
our primary products support  protect  connect  terminate  and secure cables and wires 
we also provide solar hardware systems and mounting hardware for a variety of solar power applications 
our goal is to continue to achieve profitable growth as a leader in the innovation  development  manufacture  and marketing of technically advanced products and services related to energy  communications  and cable systems and to take advantage of this leadership position to sell additional quality products in familiar markets 
the reportable segments are plp usa  australia  brazil  south africa  canada  poland and all other 
our plp usa segment is comprised of our us operations primarily supporting our domestic energy and telecommunications products 
the australia segment is comprised of all of our operations in australia supporting energy  telecommunications  data communications  and solar products 
our brazil and south africa segments are comprised of the manufacturing and sales operations from those locations which meet at least one of the criteria of a reportable segment 
our final two segments are canada and poland  which are comprised of manufacturing and sales operations  and have been included as segments to comply with reporting segments for of consolidated sales 
our remaining operations are included in all other segment as none of these operations meet the criteria for a 
table of contents reportable segment and individually represent less than for each of our combined net sales  consolidated net income  and consolidated assets 
market overview our business continues to be concentrated in the energy and communications markets 
during the past couple of years  industry consolidation continued as distributors and service provider consolidations took place in all of our major markets 
this trend is expected to continue in we have a growing concern that the continued global economic deterioration coupled with an already depressed us housing market could further affect construction projects and negatively impact growth opportunities in our core markets going forward 
in  we experienced growth in our energy markets 
we continued to see the investment in new transmission grids  new technologies  and upgrading and maintenance of the existing energy infrastructure 
we expect the distribution energy market to slow in but anticipate continued growth in demand for transmission and fiber optic products 
our international business is more concentrated in the energy markets 
historically  our international sales were primarily to the distribution portion of the energy market 
we continued to increase our energy distribution sales while also experiencing significant sales growth in the energy transmission market 
we have acquired approximately of belos sa belos  located in bielsko biala  poland  broadening our transmission product offering for the energy markets 
even though we expect the distribution portion of the energy market to decrease in as a whole  we expect the international energy markets to continue to grow for the foreseeable future as new construction projects are added in developing markets and there is a need to rebuild and refurbish the international energy transmission and distribution infrastructure 
we believe that we are well positioned to supply the needs of the world s diverse energy market requirements as a result of our strategically located operations and array of product designs and technologies 
in our communications markets  telecommunication companies continued to curtail their investment in the construction and maintenance of copper networks while diverting some of these resources into fiber to the premise fttp projects 
we anticipate the investment in the copper network will continue to decline 
additionally  the large communications carriers are rationalizing their vendor base  which results in downward pressure on prices 
in  we saw an improvement in the us investment spending on infrastructure by the telephone companies  cable television catvs providers and by municipalities 
additionally  many of our new product offerings which are presently in the approval process and undergoing third party testing should provide an opportunity to enhance our product offerings to all communication providers 
many new products were launched in which should help us gain additional business from these providers 
even though the communication market is expecting to be flat or even down in  we are optimistic that we will fare better than most due to the new products being offered to the marketplace 
in  we continued to develop our brand and product awareness internationally as part of a concentrated effort in fttp 
as a result  several international carriers are conducting field trials of our products to be used on future fttp projects 
in addition  the passage of an economic stimulus bill that contains provisions for upgrading the aging transmission infrastructure and connecting renewable energy sources to the grid should attract new investment into the industry 
we believe that this will generate growth for our products in this market over at least the next several years 
discontinued operations our consolidated financial statements were impacted by the divestiture of superior modular products smp on may  we sold our smp subsidiary for million  for a 
million gain  net of tax and expenses incurred related to the divestiture 
the sale includes million to be held in escrow for a period of one year

net cash used in investing activities of million represents a decrease of million when compared to cash used in investing activities in in may  we sold smp for million  net of transaction expenses  with an after tax gain of 
million and a holdback of million held in escrow for a period of one year 
also in may  we formed a joint venture with bluesky energy pty ltd for an initial cash payment of 
million 
additional payouts for acquisitions during consisted of 
million related to dpw and million for belos mostly due to earn out payments 
in march  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of dpw for an initial payment of million 
in september  we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of belos for an initial payment of million 
capital expenditures increased 
million in the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due mostly to a solar installation project at our spain subsidiary  additional machinery investment at our brazil and poland subsidiaries and plp usa locations  and a new building added at our china subsidiary 
cash used in financing activities was million compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of common shares repurchased of million and million higher debt repayments in compared to we have commitments under operating leases primarily for office and manufacturing space  transportation equipment  office and computer equipment and capital leases primarily for equipment 
one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk to make up a deficiency from market value attributable to damage  extraordinary wear and tear  excess air hours or exceeding maintenance overhaul schedules required by the federal aviation administration 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be immaterial because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value 
our financial position remains strong and our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  our current ratio increased primarily due to increases in inventory and decreases in debt  trade payables and accrued expenses related to acquisitions 
at december   our unused balance under our main credit facility was million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 
the revolving credit agreement contains  among other provisions  requirements for maintaining levels of working capital  net worth and profitability 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our existing cash of million  together with our untapped borrowing capacity  provides substantial financial resources 
if we were to incur significant additional indebtedness  we expect to be able to meet liquidity needs under the credit facilities 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition 
the global economies are currently undergoing a period of economic uncertainty  and the related financial markets are experiencing unprecedented volatility 
the current financial turmoil is adversely affecting the banking system and financial markets 
the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or fail has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency  and equity markets 
uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and or declines in income or asset values  or lower demand for their products or services which could have a material negative effect on the 
table of contents demand for our products 
if the future economic environment continues to be less favorable than it has been in recent years  we could experience difficulties in our ability to obtain the required capital to pursue possible acquisitions 
in addition  there could be exposure related to the financial viability of certain third party suppliers  some of which are our sole source for a particular supply item  and risk of potential customer bankruptcies and or slower payments 
the volatility in the financial markets will also affect the valuation of our pension assets and postretirement liabilities  resulting in potentially higher postretirement costs in future periods 
also  if the dollar continues to strengthen  there will be a negative impact on sales and income from continuing operations when the results of our foreign operations are converted to u 
s dollars 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are summarized in the following tables payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years thousands of dollars notes payable to bank a long term debt b capital leases operating leases purchase commitments pension contribution and other retirement plans c income taxes payable  non current d amount of commitment expiration by period less than after other commercial commitments total year years years years thousands of dollars letters of credit guarantees a interest on short term debt is included in the table at an interest rate of in effect at december  b interest on long term debt is included in the table at interest rates from to based on the variable interest rates in effect at december  c amount represents the expected contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan in future expected amounts have not been disclosed as such amounts are subject to change based on performance of the assets in the plan as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation 
at december   the company s unfunded contractual obligation was million 
the company s supplemental profit sharing plan accrued liability at december  was million 
future expected amounts have not been disclosed as the company is unable to estimate the years in which benefit payments may occur 
d as of december   there were million of tax liabilities  including interest  related to unrecognized tax benefits 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  if any  the company is unable to estimate the years in which cash settlement may occur with the respective tax authorities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
sales recognition we record sales when products are shipped and the title and risk of loss has passed to unaffiliated customers 
revenue related to shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold 
receivable allowances allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents approximately of our trade receivable at december  and of our trade receivable at december  reserve for credit memos we maintain an allowance for future sales credits related to sales recorded during the year 
our estimated allowance is based on historical sales credits issued in the subsequent year related to the prior year and any significant open return good authorizations as of the balance sheet date 
our allowance is updated on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for out of period credits represents approximately of our trade receivables at december  and excess and obsolescence reserves we provide excess and obsolescence reserves to state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
we identify inventory items which have had no usage or are in excess of the usages over the historical to months 
a management team with representatives from marketing  manufacturing  engineering and finance reviews these inventory items  determines the disposition of the inventory and assesses the estimated market value based on their knowledge of the product and market conditions 
these conditions include  among other things  future demand for product  product utility  unique customer order patterns or unique raw material purchase patterns  changes in customer and quality issues 
at december  and  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was and of gross inventory 
if the impact of market conditions worsens from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to 
table of contents growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
our measurement date for our annual impairment test is january of each year 
we perform interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
there were no trigger events during and as such  only an annual impairment test was performed 
during losses continued for our thailand operation which presented an indicator that the goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill for the thailand operation in the amount of 
million was impaired and written off as of january  deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we established a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions we identify tax positions taken on the federal  state  local and foreign income tax returns filed or to be filed 
a tax position can include a reduction in taxable income reported in a previously filed tax return or expected to be reported on a future tax return that impacts the measurement of current or deferred income tax assets or liabilities in the period being reported  a decision not to file a tax return  an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions  the characterization of income or a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return  or a decision to classify a transaction  entity or other position in a tax return as tax exempt 
we determine whether a tax position is an uncertain or a routine business transaction tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained at the full amount upon examination 
under fin  tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce our current or future income tax liability  are reported in our financial statements only to the extent that each benefit was recognized and measured under a two step approach 
the first step requires us to assess whether each tax position based on its technical merits and facts and circumstances as of the reporting date  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the second step measures the amount of tax benefit that we recognize in the financial statements  based on a cumulative probability approach 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold that is not highly certain is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority  assuming that the tax authority has examined the position and has full knowledge of all relevant information 
fin requires subjectivity of judgments to identify outcomes and to assign probability in order to estimate the settlement amount 
we provide estimates in order to determine settlement amounts 
during the year ended december   we recognized a benefit of 
million of uncertain tax positions 
at december   the total reserve for uncertain tax positions and related interest is million 
business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method  which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date 
we recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets less liabilities as goodwill 
when the amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the cost of the acquired business  we recognize an additional cost element for the acquired business related to any contingent consideration and recognize a liability for the lesser of the maximum amount of the contingent consideration or the excess 
when the amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the cost 
table of contents of the acquired business including any related contingent consideration  we allocate the excess as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to the acquired property and equipment and other intangible assets of the acquired business 
generally we use third party appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and identifiable intangibles and consult with actuaries to determine the fair value of obligations under retirement plans assumed and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims  if any 
pensions we record plan assets  obligations and expenses related to pension benefit plans based on actuarial valuations  which include key assumptions on discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and compensation increases 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
the effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
the discount rate of at december  reflects an analysis of yield curves as of the end of the year and the schedule of expected cash needs of the plan 
the expected long term return on plan assets of reflects the plan s historical returns and represents our best estimate of the likely future returns on the plan s asset mix 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience  market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries 
however  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost  while a decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  an increase in the expected long term return on plan assets would decrease the net periodic pension cost  while a decrease in expected long term return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost
