item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kellogg company and subsidiaries results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company  our operations and our present business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this report 
kellogg company is the world s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods  including cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit snacks  frozen waffles  and veggie foods 
kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 
we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments  comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
beginning in  the asia pacific segment includes south africa  which was formerly a part of europe 
prior years were restated for comparison purposes 
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets 
these targets are low single digit to for internal net sales  mid single digit to for internal operating profit  and high single digit to for net earnings per share on a currency neutral basis 
see foreign currency translation section on page for an explanation of the company s definition of currency neutral 
for our full year  we exceeded our net sales target with reported net sales growth of  and internal growth of 
consolidated operating profit increased  on internal growth of  in line with our target

additionally  internal operating profit growth for excludes the impact of adopting sfas no 
r share based payment 
accordingly  internal net sales operating profit growth is a non gaap financial measure  which is further discussed and reconciled to gaap basis growth on page b at the beginning of  we adopted sfas no 
r share based payment  which reduced our fiscal operating profit by million million after tax or 
per share  due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants 
correspondingly  our reported operating profit and net earnings growth for was reduced by approximately and diluted net earnings per share growth was reduced by approximately 
c see section entitled foreign currency translation for discussion and reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure 
in combination with an attractive dividend yield  we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders 
we believe we can achieve this sustainable growth through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business  expanding our snacks business  and pursuing selected growth opportunities 
we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profit rich  sustainable sales growth  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital 
we believe our steady earnings growth  strong cash flow  and continued investment during a multi year period of significant commodity and energy driven cost inflation demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model

d impact of rd shipping week in during  our consolidated net sales increased almost driven by our north america business with increases in both volume and price mix for the year 
internal net sales grew over  building on a rate of internal growth during we had a fifty third week in our fiscal year which contributed almost to our reported growth over the prior year as did our acquisitions 
for further information on our acquisitions refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page management has estimated the pro forma effect on the company s results of operations as though these business combinations had been completed at the beginning of either or would have been immaterial 
successful innovation  brand building advertising and consumer promotion investment as well as our recent price increases continued to drive growth 
declines in volume in both europe and latin america were more than offset by growth in pricing mix due to our price increases 
asia pacific had a particularly strong year experiencing growth of driven by cereal sales across the operating segment 
for  our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of almost with internal net sales growth of 
the growth was broad based and driven by our price realization and strong innovation 
the major product brands grew as follows retail cereal  retail snacks cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  and fruit snacks  frozen and specialty channels frozen foods  food service and vending 
while retail cereal grew for the year  we had a relatively soft share performance in the fourth quarter facing aggressive price based incentives from our competitors 
in addition  while we estimate our consumption was up across all channels  reductions in trade inventory also adversely affected shipments 
as a result  our fourth quarter internal net sales declined by which was up against a tough comparable of growth in the prior year 
our snacks business grew in on top of growth last year 
our growth came from volume  price increases  and successful innovations such as townhouse flipsides and cheez it duoz 
we saw net sales growth in all product categories toaster pastries  crackers  cookies and wholesome snacks 
our right bites calorie cookie and cracker packs performed well as we saw an increase in demand for portion controlled portable food 
our specialty and frozen channels grew over 
our food service business performed well  achieving mid single digit growth for the year 
frozen realized strong sales driven by innovations such as bake shop swirlz  mini muffin tops and french toast waffles 
our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of  or on an internal basis 
europe s internal net sales grew by almost attributable to price mix  as volume was down slightly 
the uk and continental europe have been impacted by the economic crisis which has consumers searching for value and retailers reducing inventory 
snacks products are performing well across the region  especially in the uk driven by rice krispies squares 
latin america s internal net sales growth was attributable to our price increases and driven by cereal sales in mexico and venezuela 
this year s growth is on top of last year s growth 
volume was down for the year due to the economic environment which is impacting consumer confidence 
asia pacific had a very strong year with internal net sales growth 
the growth was volume driven and broad based in both retail cereal and retail snacks 
consolidated operating profit grew by almost on an as reported basis and on an internal basis 
operating profit in all areas was impacted by significant cost pressures as discussed in more detail in the margin performance section beginning on page north america grew by driven by growth in net sales and lower exit costs which offset higher 
table of contents commodity costs 
costs associated with the peanut related recall of kellogg products adversely impacted north america s operating profit by million or of the full year operating profit 
see the subsequent event section on page for more details 
operating profit declined slightly in both europe and latin america due to increased commodity costs and cost reduction initiatives 
asia pacific s operating profit increased on an internal basis due to strong top line growth 
on a consolidated basis  operating profit from acquisitions decreased internal operating profit by  in line with our expectations  with europe and asia pacific being particularly impacted by our russian and chinese acquisitions  respectively

internal net sales grew over  building on a rate of internal growth during successful innovation  brand building advertising and consumer promotion investment and in store execution continued to drive broad based sales growth across each of our enterprise wide product groups 
in fact  we achieved growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating segments 
for  our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of 
internal net sales grew over  with each major product group contributing as follows retail cereal  retail snacks cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit snacks  frozen and specialty food service  club stores  vending  convenience  drug and value stores channels 
the significant growth achieved by our north america snacks business built on internal growth of in our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately or on an internal basis  with leading dollar contributions from our businesses in the uk  france  mexico  and venezuela 
internal sales of our asia pacific operating segment which represents approximately of our consolidated results were approximately even with the prior year  as solid growth in asian markets was offset by weak performance in our australian business 
consolidated operating profit for grew  with internal operating profit up versus for  europe contributed a strong internal growth rate  driven by increased sales and stronger gross margins  as well as lower up front costs 
despite a strong sales performance  operating profit in our north american segment was dampened by continued commodity cost pressures and significantly higher up front costs associated with cost reduction initiatives as more fully discussed on page our latin america and asia pacific operating segments suffered operating profit declines  primarily driven by lower gross margins due to increased commodity costs  as well as the previously mentioned weak performance in our australian business 
margin performance margin performance is presented in the following table 
change vs 
prior year pts 
gross margin a sga b operating margin a gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold 
b selling  general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of net sales 
we strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in brand building and innovation 
our strategy for increasing our gross profit is to manage external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements  productivity savings  and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging 
for  our gross profit was up million over  an increase of 
our gross profit would have increased by an additional million excluding the impact of foreign currency 
our decline in gross margin for and reflects the impact of significant cost pressure with higher costs for commodities  energy  and fuel being partially offset by the impact of cost reduction initiatives and increased 
table of contents pricing 
for  these cost pressures represented of s cost of goods sold  primarily associated with our ingredient purchases 
in  these cost pressures represented of the prior year s cost of goods sold 
in  acquisitions negatively impacted margin by basis points 
for  we expect inflationary trends to continue although we plan to offset the expected to of cost pressures by savings from cost reduction initiatives of up to to keep the gross margin percentage approximately flat year over year 
for  our sga decreased over the prior year due to our strong net sales growth  lower expense related to cost reduction initiatives recorded in sga  continued discipline in overhead spending and efficiencies in advertising and promotion 
for  our sga was negatively impacted by the reorganization of our direct store door delivery dsd operations 
total program costs of million were recorded in sga expense  as discussed further in the exit or disposal activities section 
foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
certain of our assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues  are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro  british pound  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates 
as a result  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if their value has not changed in their original currency 
this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 
the recent volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future us reported earnings 
as such  we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis  assuming earnings are translated at the prior year s exchange rates 
this non gaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results  thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company 
management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a better measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 
below is a reconciliation of reported diluted eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years  and consolidated results diluted net earnings per share eps translational impact a currency neutral diluted eps currency neutral diluted eps growth b a translational impact is the difference between reported eps and the translation of current year net profits at prior year exchange rates  adjusted for any gains losses on translational hedges 
b the growth percentage for has been adjusted for the impact of our adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment  which reduced our fiscal operating profit by million million after tax or 
per share  due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants 
correspondingly  our reported operating profit and net earnings growth for was reduced by approximately and diluted net earnings per share growth was reduced by approximately 
exit or disposal activities we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long term profit growth targets 
initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion 
each cost reduction initiative is normally up to three years in duration 
upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs  the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation 
certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal activities for which material charges have been incurred 
we include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability 
cost summary for we recorded million of costs associated with exit or disposal activities comprised of million of asset write offs  million of severance and other cash costs and million related to pension costs 
million of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the europe operating segment  with the balance recorded in sga expense in the latin america operating segment

the company s operating segments were impacted as follows in millions north america  europe exit cost reserves at january  were million related to severance payments 
exit cost reserves were million at december   consisting of million for severance and million for lease termination payments 
specific initiatives during the fourth quarter of  we executed a cost reduction initiative in latin america that resulted in the elimination of approximately salaried positions 
the cost of the program was million and was recorded in latin america s sga expense 
the charge related primarily to severance benefits which were paid by the end of the year 
there were no reserves as of january  related to this program 
we commenced a multi year european manufacturing optimization plan in to improve utilization of our facility in manchester  england and to better align production in europe 
the project resulted in an elimination of approximately hourly and salaried positions from our manchester facility through voluntary early retirement and severance programs 
the pension trust funding requirements of these early retirements exceeded the recognized benefit expense by million which was funded in during this program certain manufacturing equipment was removed from service 
all of the costs for the european manufacturing optimization plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within our europe operating segment

employee severance reserves to date beginning end of millions of period accruals payments period year ended december  year ended january  in july  we began a plan to reorganize our direct store door delivery dsd operations in the southeastern united states 
this dsd reorganization plan was intended to integrate our southeastern sales and distribution regions with the rest of our us dsd operations  resulting in greater efficiency across the nationwide network 
we exited approximately distribution route franchise agreements with independent contractors 
the plan also resulted in the involuntary termination or relocation of approximately employee positions 
total project costs incurred were million  principally consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise settlements and to a lesser extent  for employee separation  relocation  and reorganization 
exit reserves were million at december  and were paid in all of the costs for the us dsd reorganization plan have been recorded in sga expense within our north america operating segment 
this initiative is complete 
during  we commenced several initiatives to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our 
table of contents us cereal manufacturing network  primarily through technological and sourcing improvements in warehousing and packaging operations 
in conjunction with these initiatives  we offered voluntary separation incentives  which resulted in the retirement of approximately hourly employees by early during  we incurred approximately million of total up front costs  comprised of approximately asset write offs and cash costs  including million of pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses 
these initiatives were complete by the end of also during  we undertook an initiative to improve customer focus and selling efficiency within a particular latin american market  leading to a shift from a third party distributor to a direct sales force model 
as a result of this initiative  we paid million in cash during to exit the existing distribution arrangement 
during we finalized our pension plan withdrawal liability related to our north america snacks bakery consolidation which was executed in and the final liability was million  million of which was recognized in and million in  and was paid in the third quarter of other cost reduction initiatives in addition to investments in exit or disposal activities  we undertook various other cost reduction initiatives during we incurred million of expense in connection with a payment for the restructuring of our labor force at a manufacturing facility in mexico 
this cost was recorded in cost of goods sold in the latin america operating segment 
we also incurred million of expense for the elimination of the accelerated ownership feature of certain employee stock options 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
this expense was recorded in sga expense within corporate results 
during  we also began a lean manufacturing initiative in certain us  latin american and european manufacturing facilities 
we are referring to this initiative as k lean which stands for kellogg s lean  efficient  agile network 
this program will ensure we are optimizing our manufacturing network  reducing waste  developing best practices across our global facilities and reducing future capital expenditures 
we incurred costs of million for consulting recorded in cost of goods sold primarily within our north america operating segment 
the total cost and cash outlay for this program is estimated to be million 
this project is expected to be primarily complete by the end of interest expense as illustrated in the following table  annual interest expense for the period has been relatively steady  which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time 
interest income recorded in other income expense  net increased from approximately million in to million in  resulting in net interest expense of approximately million for we currently expect that our gross interest expense will be approximately million 
change vs

other income expense  net other income expense  net includes non operating items such as interest income  charitable donations  and gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange and commodity derivatives 
other income expense  net for the periods presented was in millions   the variability in other income expense  net  among years reflects the timing of certain charges explained in the following paragraph 
charges for contributions to the kellogg s corporate citizenship fund  a private trust established for charitable giving were as follows in millions   interest income was in millions   net foreign currency exchange gains losses were in millions   
income expense recognized for premiums on commodity options was in millions   gains losses on company owned life insurance coli  due to changes in cash surrender value  were in millions   income taxes our long term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of 
we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our target 
excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of repatriating foreign earnings  our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for was and was for both and we currently expect our sustainable rate to be approximately 
our reported rates of for and for were lower than the sustainable rate due to the 
table of contents favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements  international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate changes 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
for  we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately to 
this could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also impact the effective tax rate as it is dependent upon the us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates 
subsequent event on january   we announced a precautionary hold on certain austin and keebler branded peanut butter sandwich crackers and certain famous amos and keebler branded peanut butter cookies while the us food and drug administration and other authorities investigated peanut corporation of america pca  one of kellogg s peanut paste suppliers for the cracker and cookie products 
on january   kellogg voluntarily recalled those products because the paste ingredients supplied to kellogg had the potential to be contaminated with salmonella 
the recall was expanded on january  february and february  to include certain bear naked  kashi and special k products impacted by pca ingredients 
we have incurred costs associated with the recalls and in accordance with us gaap we recorded certain items associated with this subsequent event in our fiscal year financial results 
the charges associated with the recalls reduced north america full year operating profit by million or of eps 
we expect a similar impact in of the total charges  million related to estimated customer returns and consumer rebates and was recorded as a reduction to net sales  million related to costs associated with returned product and the disposal and write off of inventory which was recorded as cost of goods sold  and million related to other costs which were recorded as sga expense 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
credit environment the us and global economies began a period of uncertainty starting in financial markets continue to experience unprecedented volatility 
beginning in the third quarter of and thereafter  global capital and credit markets  including commercial paper markets  experienced increased instability and disruption 
our company s financial strength was evident throughout this period of uncertainty  as we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets 
although interest rates on our us commercial paper increased by an average of basis points during the period from mid september through october  the average interest rate we paid for commercial paper borrowings in declined to from an average of in our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings have not been affected by the changes in the credit environment  and the amount of our total debt outstanding remained relatively flat over the past three years 
if needed  we have additional sources of liquidity available to us 
these sources include our access to public debt and or equity markets  and the ability to sell trade receivables 
our five year credit agreement  which expires in  allows us to borrow up to billion on a revolving credit basis 
this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis  although we do not currently plan to use it 
we monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions  including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities  our derivative financial instruments  and other arrangements 
we believe that our operating cash flows  together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing  will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding  based on a trailing month average is relatively short  equating to approximately days for  days for and days for the decrease in was the result of a decrease in days of inventory outstanding  while the decrease in reflected an increase in days of trade payables outstanding 

table of contents the following table presents the major components of our operating cash flow during the current and prior year to date periods dollars in millions operating activities net earnings year over year change items in net earnings not requiring providing cash depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes other a net earnings after non cash items year over year change pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions changes in operating assets and liabilities core working capital b other working capital total net cash provided by operating activities year over year change a consists principally of non cash expense accruals for employee compensation and benefit obligations 
b inventory  trade receivables and trade payables 
our net cash provided by operating activities for was million lower than  due primarily to a substantial increase in pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions in and an unfavorable year over year variance in other working capital 
partially offsetting the decrease was the impact of changes in deferred income taxes and a favorable variance in core working capital 
our net cash provided by operating activities for was million higher than the comparable period of  due primarily to growth in cash basis earnings and favorable total working capital performance 
as compared to  the favorable movement in core working capital during was related principally to higher accounts payable  which were due in part to increased payment terms in international locations 
in  core working capital was an average of of net sales  an improvement of compared with in  core working capital was an average of of net sales  consistent with we manage core working capital through timely collection of accounts receivable  extending terms on accounts payable and careful monitoring of inventory 
other working capital in reflected an increase in cash paid associated with hedging programs  cash paid for advertising and promotion  and the impact of changes in accrued salaries and wages 
other working capital in was a use of cash versus a source of cash in the difference related to a year over year increase in the amount of income tax payments 
recent adverse conditions in the equity markets caused the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed long term rate of return of 
as a result  we decided to make additional contributions to our pension and postretirement plans amounting to million in the fourth quarter of our total pension and postretirement plan funding for totaled million  while funding in and amounted to million and million  respectively 
in  the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states 
the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax qualified plans 
the ppa will ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our us plans 
we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
we currently project that we will make total us and foreign plan contributions in of approximately million 
actual contributions could be different from our current projections  as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  trust asset performance  renewals of union contracts  or higher than expected health care claims cost experience 
our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchases 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change our cash flow as defined reflects the impact of the additional pension contributions we made in the fourth quarter of for  we are expecting cash flow as defined in the range of  million to  million 
this projection assumes an adverse impact on cash flow of approximately million associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect to achieve our target principally through operating profit growth  lower contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in  and continued prudent management of our working capital 

table of contents investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for amounted to million  an increase of million compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in increased by million compared with cash paid for acquisitions during and were the primary drivers of increases in cash used in investing activities  as we expanded our platform for future growth with acquisitions in russia  china  the us and australia 
acquisitions are discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to in  in and in in  capital spending consisted primarily of construction costs to increase capacity in europe and to expand our global research center in battle creek  michigan 
in  we made capacity expansions to accommodate sales growth  including the purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in chicago  illinois 
we expect our k lean manufacturing efficiency initiative to result in a trend toward lower capital spending 
going forward  our long term target for capital spending is between and of net sales 
our capital plan includes spending for a new facility to manufacture ready to eat cereal in mexico and continued spending on the ongoing project to expand the global research center in battle creek  michigan 
the expansion of the w 
k 
kellogg institute for food and nutrition research reflects our commitment to research and innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business 
financing activities our net cash used in financing activities for  and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
in march  we issued million of five year fixed rate us dollar notes under an existing shelf registration statement 
we used proceeds of million from issuance of this long term debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper 
in conjunction with this debt issuance  we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million  which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the five year term 
in  we had cash outflows of million in connection with the repayment of five year us dollar notes at maturity in june that debt had an effective interest rate of in january  we increased our available credit via a million unsecured day credit agreement 
the million credit agreement expired in january and we decided not to renew it 
in february  we redeemed euro notes for million 
to partially finance this redemption  we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million or its equivalent in alternative currencies 
in december  the company issued million of five year fixed rate us dollar notes under the existing shelf registration statement  using the proceeds to replace a portion of our us commercial paper 
during  and  we repurchased million of our common stock each year under programs authorized by our board of directors 
the number of shares repurchased amounted to approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  in  and the activity consisted principally of a private transaction with the w 
k 
kellogg foundation trust to repurchase approximately million shares for million 
on february   the board of directors authorized a million share repurchase authorization for that we plan to execute largely in the second half of the year 
the board also canceled a million share repurchase authorization that it had authorized in third quarter we made no purchases under the million share repurchase authorization because of our decision to use cash to fund pension plans and reduce commercial paper in the fourth quarter of we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling per share in  per share in and per share in cash paid for dividends increased by in  and by in our objective is to maintain our dividend pay out ratio between and of reported net earnings 
at january   our total debt was billion  approximately level with the balance at year end our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions 
some agreements also contain change in control provisions 
however  they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in the company s credit ratings could limit our access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our aforementioned credit facilities 
we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions 
this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow  our short term borrowings  and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of january  and december  the company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations

table of contents contractual obligations payments due by period and millions total beyond long term debt principal interest a capital leases operating leases purchase obligations b uncertain tax positions c other long term d total a includes interest payments on long term fixed rate debt and variable rate interest swaps 
b purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under various co marketing agreements and to a lesser extent  of service agreements  and contracts for future delivery of commodities  packaging materials  and equipment 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not obligated to incur 
therefore  it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 
c in addition to the million reported in the column and classified as a current liability  the company has million recorded in long term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid 
d other long term contractual obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year end and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements  multiemployer plans  and supplemental employee retirement benefits 
the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through as follows  critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events  feature price discounts  consumer coupons  contests and loyalty programs 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than of our company s net sales 
however  our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately of net sales  therefore  it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
goodwill and other intangible assets we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in evaluating impairment of intangibles 
we perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction 
similarly  impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we also apply the principles of sfas no 
in evaluating the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized  an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing 
table of contents regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
at january   goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company 
within this total  approximately billion of non goodwilll intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived  comprised principally of keebler trademarks 
we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company 
however  if we had used materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our north american snacks business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation  this could have resulted in significant impairment losses and or amortization expense 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we follow sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees active working life 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom  and canada 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are generally not revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equated to approximately the th percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign trust investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan assets 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january   a basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
correspondingly  a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss 
any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
under this recognition method  a basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in for each of the three fiscal years  our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions   to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost 
table of contents growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at january   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately million 
any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years  resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by sfas no 
the net experience gain arising from recognition of claims experience was approximately million 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities  with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index for our us plans 
to test the appropriateness of these indices  we periodically conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and the bond maturities  consisting principally of aa rated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions non callable issues with at least million principal outstanding 
the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due 
for those years where no suitable bonds are available  the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years 
during  we refined our methodology for setting our discount rate by inputting the cash flows for our pension  postretirement and postemployment plans into the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index 
the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at january   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of january   we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately billion  as compared to approximately billion at december  the year over year increase in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to poor asset performance during of the total unamortized amounts at january   approximately billion was related to asset losses during  with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate prior to for  we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately million higher than the actual amount of approximately million 
total employee benefit expense for is expected to be slightly higher than due to increased amortization of experience losses which is offset by assumed asset returns on our contributions 
based on our current actuarial assumptions  we expect pension expense to increase significantly primarily due to the amortization of net experience losses 
during we made contributions in the amount of million to kellogg s global tax qualified pension programs 
this amount was mostly discretionary 
we anticipate having to make additional contributions in future years to make up for the poor performance of global equity markets during additionally we contributed million to our retiree medical programs  most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits 
assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions  annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the amount 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit should be recognized in our income tax expense 
we establish tax reserves in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
which we adopted at the beginning of fin no 
is based on a benefit recognition model  which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain 
table of contents circumstances 
prior to the adoption of fin no 
 our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
the initial application of fin no 
resulted in a net decrease to the company s consolidated accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately million  with an offsetting increase to retained earnings 
the company evaluates a tax position in two steps in accordance with fin no 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the position 
in weighing the technical merits of the position  we consider the facts and circumstances of the position  we assume the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position  and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance 
the second step is measurement  a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
while reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes  the company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
for the periods presented  our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately million 
reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded of earnings before income taxes annually 
significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
the current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other liabilities 
likewise  the current portion of related interest reserves are presented in the balance sheet within accrued other current liabilities  with the amount expected to be settled after one year recorded in other liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents future outlook for  despite a tough economic outlook  we expect our business model and strategy will deliver internal net sales growth of to and internal operating profit growth of mid single digits to which are in line with our long term annual growth targets 
we expect our earnings per share to grow at high single digits to on a currency neutral basis 
gross profit margin percentage is expected to remain approximately flat as our cost reduction initiatives and price realization offset pressure on cost of goods sold 
gross interest expense for is expected to decline to approximately million driven by lower short term interest rates 
our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately to 
we continue to remain committed to investing in brand building  cost reduction initiatives  and other growth opportunities 
lastly  we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting cash flow to be between  million and  million after capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  intercompany loans and product shipments 
our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
in addition  we have operations located in venezuela where the local currency is exposed to a highly volatile economic environment 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement receivable of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement receivable would have decreased by approximately million at year end and the settlement obligation would have increased by million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
interest rate risk our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
in connection with the issuance of us dollar notes on march   we entered into interest rate swaps 
refer to disclosures contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year end assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in and million in price risk our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  paperboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than months 
during  we entered into two separate year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes 
the notional amount of the swaps totaled million as of january  and equates to approximately of our north america manufacturing needs 
at year end the notional amount was million 

table of contents the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the north america natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  the settlement obligation would increase by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement receivable of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  this settlement receivable would decrease by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds 
these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash  treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount 
there were no collateral balance requirements at january  or december  in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above  we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials  including rice  sugar  cartonboard  and corrugated boxes 
the company has contracts in place with its suppliers that provide for pricing that is lower than market prices at january  it should be noted the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company
