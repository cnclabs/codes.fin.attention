capital expenditures consist of the purchase of property and equipment  capitalized software and new capital lease obligations 
ebitda consists of net income loss minus interest income  plus interest expense  plus income tax expense  plus depreciation and amortization and minus minority interest 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on short term investments or cash deposits 
interest expense primarily consists of interest expense for capital leases  long term and short term borrowings 
we use ebitda as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda year ended june  net income loss interest expense  net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization minority interest ebitda to ensure that all schools are reflected in our measure of enrollments  we consider our enrollments as of the end of september to be our opening enrollment level  and the number of students enrolled at the end of may to be our ending enrollment level 
to provide comparability  we do not consider enrollment levels for june  july and august as all schools are not open during these months 
for each period  average enrollments represent the average of the month end enrollment levels for each month that has transpired between september and the end of the period  up to and including the month of may

executive summary we are a technology based education company 
we offer proprietary curriculum and educational services created for online delivery to students in kindergarten through th grade  or k our mission is to maximize a child s potential by providing access to an engaging and effective education  regardless of geographic location or socio economic background 
since our inception  we have invested more than million to develop curriculum and an online learning platform that promotes mastery of core concepts and skills for students of all abilities 
this learning system combines a cognitive research based curriculum with an individualized learning approach well suited for virtual schools and other educational applications 
from fiscal year to fiscal year  we increased average enrollments in the virtual public schools we serve from approximately  students to  students  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
over the same period  we increased revenues from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately  and increased ebitda from million to million  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
over the same timeframe  we went from a net income of million to net income of million  and from an operating income of million to operating income of million 
we deliver our learning system to students primarily through virtual public schools 
many states have embraced virtual public schools as a means to provide families with a publicly funded alternative to a traditional classroom based education 
we offer virtual schools our proprietary curriculum  online learning platform and varying levels of academic and management services  which can range from targeted programs to complete turnkey solutions  under long term contracts 
these contracts provide the basis for a recurring revenue stream as students 
table of contents progress through successive grades 
additionally  without the requirement of a physical classroom  virtual schools can be scaled quickly to accommodate a large dispersed student population  and allow more capital resources to be allocated towards teaching  curriculum and technology rather than towards a physical infrastructure 
our proprietary curriculum is currently used primarily by public school students in states and the district of columbia  including two new states approved for the fall of parents can also purchase our curriculum and online learning platform directly to facilitate or supplement their children s education 
additionally  we have piloted our curriculum in brick and mortar classrooms with promising academic results 
we also believe there is additional widespread applicability for our learning system internationally 
our history we were founded in to utilize the advances in technology to provide children access to a high quality public school education regardless of their geographic location or socio economic background 
given the geographic flexibility of technology based education  we believed that the pursuit of this mission could help address the growing concerns regarding the regionalized disparity in the quality of public school education  both in the united states and abroad 
these concerns were reflected in the passage of the no child left behind nclb act of  which implemented new standards and accountability requirements for public k education 
the convergence of these concerns and rapid advances in internet technology created the opportunity to make a significant impact by deploying a high quality learning system on a flexible  online platform 
in september  after months of research and development on our curriculum  we launched our kindergarten through nd grade offering 
we initially launched our learning system in virtual public schools in pennsylvania and colorado  serving approximately students in the two states combined 
we launched additional grades and entered additional states over the past seven years 
we have also developed and launched hybrid programs that combine face to face time in the classroom with online instruction 
for the school year  we operated in states as set forth in the table below 
for the school year  we have been approved to operate in oklahoma and wyoming bringing the total states were we operate to the following table sets forth the enrollment  grade level  and new state by school year approximate total school year enrollment grades offered new states sy k nd colorado  pennsylvania  sy  k th arkansas  california  idaho  minnesota  ohio sy  k th arizona  florida  utah  wisconsin sy  k th kansas sy  k th texas sy  k th illinois  washington  sy  k th georgia  nevada sy  k th hawaii  indiana  oregon  south carolina in october  we acquired all of the stock of power glide  a provider of online language courseware  for million in shares of common stock and the assumption of liabilities 
we use these courses in our virtual public schools and believe they have wide applicability in online learning 
in december  we completed an initial public offering ipo of our common stock in which we sold and issued  shares of our common stock  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of 
table of contents million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  and other offering costs of million 
concurrently with the closing of the ipo and at the initial public offering price  we sold shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million to a non us person  in a private placement transaction outside the united states in reliance upon regulation s under the securities act 
this non us person is affiliated with our middle east joint venture partner 
in january  we launched the k international academy  an accredited  online private school which serves students in the us and throughout the world 
in august  we established a joint venture with a middle east partner 
the purpose of the joint venture is to develop and manage the distribution of our learning system in the gulf cooperating countries 
the k international academy has a branch facility in dubai  operated under this joint venture 
our investment into this joint venture consists of million in cash and contributed assets in return for a ownership interest 
our middle east partner contributed million in cash in return for a ownership interest 
we believe we have significant growth potential 
therefore  over the last four years  we have put a great deal of effort into developing the infrastructure necessary to scale our business 
we further enhanced our logistics and technological infrastructure and implemented sophisticated financial systems to allow us to more effectively operate a large and growing company 
key aspects and trends of our operations revenues we generate a significant portion of our revenues from enrollments in virtual public schools 
in each of the past five years  more than of our revenues have been derived through contracts with these schools 
we anticipate that these revenues will continue to represent the bulk of our total revenues over the next months  although the percentage may decline over the longer term as we identify new channels through which to market our curriculum and educational services 
these contracts provide the channels through which we can enroll students into the school  and we execute marketing and recruiting programs designed to create awareness and generate enrollments for these schools 
we generate our revenues by providing each student with access to our online lessons and offline learning kits  including use of a personal computer 
in addition  we provide a variety of management and academic support services to virtual public schools  ranging from turnkey end to end management solutions to a single service to meet a school s specific needs 
we also generate revenues from sales of our curriculum and offline learning kits through other channels  including directly to consumers and pilots in a traditional classroom environment 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the nature and extent of the management services provided to the schools and school districts  iii state or district per student funding levels  and iv prices for our products and services 
we define an enrollment as a full time student using our provided courses as their primary curriculum regardless of the nature and extent of the management services we provide to the virtual public school 
generally  students will take five or six courses  except for some kindergarten students who may participate in half day programs 
we count each half day kindergarten student as an enrollment 
school sessions generally begin in august or september and end in may or june 
we consider the duration of a school year to be months 
to ensure that all schools are reflected in our measure of enrollments  we consider the number of students on the last day of september to be our opening enrollment level  and the number of students enrolled on the last day of may to be our ending enrollment level 
to provide comparability  we do not consider enrollment levels for june  july and august as most schools are not open during these months 
for each period  average enrollments represent the average of the month end enrollment levels for each month that has transpired between september and the end of the period  up to and including the month of may 
we continually evaluate our enrollment levels by state  by school and by grade 
we track new student enrollments and withdrawals throughout the year 
we believe that the number of enrollments depends upon the following the number of states and school districts in which we operate  the appeal of our curriculum and instructional model to students and families  
table of contents the effectiveness of our program in delivering favorable academic outcomes  the quality of the teachers working in the virtual public schools we serve  and the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting programs 
in fiscal year  we continued our annual enrollment growth by  adding  students to total average fiscal year enrollments of  we did this by a process that combines replacing students who have withdrawn and adding new enrollments to attain our rate of growth 
we continually evaluate our trends in revenues by monitoring the number of enrollments in total  by state  by school and by grade  assessing the impact of changes in funding levels and the pricing of our curriculum and educational services 
we track enrollments throughout the year  as students enroll and withdraw 
we also provide our courses for use in a traditional classroom setting and we sell our courses directly to consumers 
our classroom course revenues are generally for single courses 
consumers typically purchase from one to six courses in a year  however  we do not monitor the progress of these students 
our k international academy can enroll students on a full or part time basis 
while we believe this offering has significant long term opportunity  we anticipate the level of revenues and enrollments will be immaterial for fy therefore  we do not include classroom  consumer or international academy students in our enrollment totals 
we closely monitor the financial performance of the virtual public schools to which we provide turnkey management services 
under the contracts with these schools  we take responsibility for any operating deficits that they may incur in a given school year 
these operating deficits represent the excess of costs over revenues incurred by the virtual public schools as reflected on their financial statements 
the costs include our charges to the schools 
these operating deficits may result from a combination of cost increases or funding reductions attributable to the following costs associated with new schools including the initial hiring of teachers  administrators and the establishment of school infrastructure  school requirements to establish contingency reserves  one time costs such as a legal claim  funding reductions due to the inability to qualify specific students for funding  and regulatory or academic performance thresholds which may restrict the ability of a school to fund all expenses 
in these cases  because a deficit may impair our ability to collect our invoices in full  we reduce revenues by the sum of these deficits 
these deficits and the related reduction to revenues have grown substantially faster than overall revenue growth 
we expect these deficits to continue to grow faster than overall revenue growth as we expand into new states  continue investment in educational programs  and incur the higher costs associated with our high school offering 
our annual growth in revenues may be materially affected by changes in the level of management services we provide to certain schools 
currently a significant portion of our enrollments are associated with virtual public schools to which we provide turnkey management services 
we are responsible for the complete management of these schools and therefore  we recognize as revenues the funds received by the schools  up to the level of costs incurred 
these costs are substantial  as they include the cost of teacher compensation and other ancillary school expenses 
accordingly  enrollments in these schools generate substantially more revenues than enrollments in other schools where we provide limited or no management services 
in these situations  our revenues are limited to invoiced amounts and are independent of the total funds received by the school from a state or district 
as a result  changes in the number of enrollments associated with schools operating under turnkey arrangements relative to total enrollments may have a disproportionate impact on average revenues per enrollment and growth in revenues relative to the growth in enrollments 
the percentage of enrollments associated with turnkey management service schools  or managed schools  was for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to the enrollments at new schools in south carolina  hawaii  oregon  and indiana as well as enrollment growth in existing managed schools 
changes in the mix of enrollments associated with turnkey management services compared with limited management services may change the average revenues per enrollment and accordingly impact total revenues 
as we renew our existing management contracts  the extent of the management services we provide may change 
our turnkey management contracts have terms from three to ten years 
we are providing turnkey management services to new schools in oklahoma and wyoming in we have also added several contracts to provide only our curriculum and limited services to individual school districts 
consequently  we anticipate that the percentage of enrollments associated with turnkey management services will 
table of contents remain relatively stable for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
considered in isolation  this would cause average revenues per enrollment to be relatively stable in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  we derived more than of our revenues from each of the ohio virtual academy and the agora cyber charter school in pennsylvania 
in aggregate  these schools accounted for of our total revenues 
we provide our full turnkey management solution pursuant to our contract with the ohio virtual academy  which terminates june  we provide our full turnkey solution to the agora cyber charter school  pursuant to a contract with the cynwyd group which expires june  each of the contracts with these schools provides for termination of the agreement if the school ceases to hold a valid and effective charter from the charter issuing authority in their respective states or if there is a material reduction in the per enrollment funding level 
the annual revenues generated under each of these contracts represent a material portion of our total revenues in fiscal year and we expect this to continue in fiscal year in july  the pennsylvania department of education initiated a charter revocation proceeding against agora  but agora will continue to operate in the school year during the pendency of that proceeding 
see also item  legal proceedings 
our annual growth in revenues will also be impacted by changes in state or district per enrollment funding levels 
these funding levels are typically established on an annual basis  are usually consistent from grade to grade  and generally increase at modest levels from year to year 
funding levels are generally set by the relevant state s budgetary process 
while this normally occurs on an annual or bi annual basis  the current economic recession has caused a departure from the normal process in some states 
during our fiscal year  several states enacted mid year funding cuts for public education  affecting the virtual public schools we serve 
in addition  we are aware of legislation involving funding reductions for public education for the school year that will affect many of the virtual public schools we serve 
in conjunction with this  states are now submitting applications for federal education funds under the american recovery and reinvestment act of stimulus package  which provides significant allocations designed to alleviate reductions in critical spending on education 
there may be mid year funding cuts to public education for the school year 
funding changes are difficult to predict 
while we believe that we have the flexibility to reduce spending to offset the impact of funding reductions  we cannot be certain that we will be able to fully mitigate the impact of the reductions on our results of operations and cash flows 
we evaluate the pricing of our curriculum and educational services annually against market benchmarks and conditions and change them as we deem appropriate 
we do not expect our price changes to have a significant impact on revenues as they are encompassed within changes in per enrollment funding levels 
instructional costs and services expenses instructional costs and services expenses include expenses directly attributable to the educational products and services we provide 
the virtual public schools we manage are the primary drivers of these costs  including teacher and administrator salaries and benefits and expenses of related support services 
instructional costs also include fulfillment costs of student textbooks and materials  depreciation and reclamation costs of computers provided for student use  and the cost of any third party online courses 
in addition  we include in instructional costs the amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems 
we measure  track and manage instructional costs and services as a percentage of revenues and on a per enrollment basis as these are key indicators of performance and operating efficiency 
as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs and services expenses increased for the year ended june   as compared to the year ended june  due to an increase in enrollments associated with managed schools compared with non managed schools 
managed school enrollments have higher costs as a percentage of revenues due to the high level of support services provided to the school 
also contributing to the increase was the rapid growth in high school enrollments relative to total enrollments 
notably  the high school instructional model includes teacher and administrative support costs on a per student basis that are higher than those of k students 
in addition  incremental freight charges due to expedited student materials shipments and fuel surcharges  partially offset by reduced costs of student materials and computers  contributed to the increase as well as start up costs associated with the commencement of school operations in four new states and two existing states 
reflecting the 
table of contents impact of these items  instructional costs and services expenses increased to of revenues for the year ended june  compared with for the year ended june  in the near term  we expect high school enrollments to grow as a percentage of total enrollments 
our high school offering requires increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our kindergarten to th grade offering 
this is due to the following i generally lower student to teacher ratios  ii higher compensation costs for some teaching positions requiring subject matter expertise  iii ancillary costs for required student support services including college placement  sat preparation and guidance counseling  and vi use of third party courses to augment our proprietary curriculum 
over time  we anticipate offsetting these factors by obtaining productivity gains in our high school instructional model  replacing third party high school courses with proprietary content  leveraging our school infrastructure and obtaining purchasing economies of scale 
we have deployed and are continuing to develop new delivery models  including a hybrid model  where students receive both face to face and online instruction 
these models necessitate additional costs including facilities related costs and additional administrative support  which are generally not required to operate typical virtual public schools 
in addition  development costs may include instructional research and curriculum development 
as a result  instructional costs as a percentage of revenues may be higher than our kindergarten through eighth grade offering 
in addition  we are pursuing expansion into new states 
if we are successful  we will incur start up costs and other expenses associated with the initial launch of a virtual public school  which may result in increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenues 
selling  administrative and other operating expenses selling  administrative and other operating expenses include the salaries  benefits and related costs of employees engaged in business development  sales and marketing  and administrative functions 
in addition  we include rent expense for our corporate headquarters and stock compensation expense 
we measure and track selling  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to track performance and efficiency of these areas 
in addition  we track measures of sales and marketing efficiency including the number of new enrollment prospects for virtual public schools and our ability to convert these prospects into enrollments 
we also track various operating  call center and information technology statistics as indicators of operating efficiency and customer service 
from fiscal year through fiscal year  our selling  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues remained relatively stable as we significantly increased our marketing and selling expenses and expanded our management team and administrative staff over this period 
for fiscal years and  our selling  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were and respectively  a decrease of and respectively  as compared to the prior year 
this decline is attributable to our ability to support growth in revenues and enrollments without a corresponding increase in management and administrative expenses 
this was offset by growth in marketing and student recruitment expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth 
we expect to gradually gain more leverage on our corporate overhead and selling resources and expect our selling  administrative and other operating expenses to decline over time as a percentage of revenues 
product development expenses product development expenses include research and development costs and overhead costs associated with the management of projects to develop curriculum and internal systems 
in addition  product development expenses include the amortization of internal systems and any impairment charges 
we measure and track our product development expenditures on a per course or project basis to measure and assess our development efficiency 
in addition  we monitor employee utilization to evaluate our workforce efficiency 
we plan to invest in additional curriculum development and related software in the future  primarily to produce additional high school courses  world language courses  new releases of existing courses and to upgrade our content management system and our ols 
we capitalize most of the costs incurred to develop our curriculum and software  beginning with application development  through production and testing 
we account for impairment of capitalized curriculum development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived 
table of contents assets 
see critical accounting policies and estimates 
we recorded impairment charges on capitalized curriculum of million for the year ended june  there were no impairment charges for the years ended june  and other factors that may affect comparability public company expenses 
upon the completion of our initial public offering  we became a public company  and our shares of common stock are publicly traded on the nyse under the symbol lrn 
as a result  we comply with new laws  regulations and requirements that we did not need to comply with as a private company  including certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  other applicable sec regulations and the requirements of the nyse 
compliance with the requirements of being a public company require us to increase our general and administrative expenses in order to pay our employees  legal counsel and independent registered public accountants to assist us in  among other things  instituting and monitoring a more comprehensive compliance and board governance function  establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws 
in addition  as a public company  it is more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance 
stock option expense 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r  requires that we recognize an expense for stock options granted beginning july  we incurred approximately million and million in stock compensation expense for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we expect stock option expense to increase in the future as we grant additional stock options 
income tax benefits resulting from decrease of valuation allowance 
in the period from our inception through fiscal year  we incurred significant operating losses that resulted in a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes 
however  in each of the three years ending june   we have generated increasing enrollments  revenue and operating profit 
as a result  in fiscal year  we determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of our net deferred tax asset would be utilized 
for the year ended june   we recognized a net income tax benefit of million 
this reflects the net effect of a million tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets and an income tax expense of million  or of pretax income 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million  or of pretax income 
public funding and regulation 
our public school customers are financed with federal  state and local government funding 
budget appropriations for education at all levels of government are determined through a political process and impacted by general economic conditions  and  as a result  our revenues may be affected by changes in appropriations 
decreases in funding could result in an adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
competition 
the market for providing online education for grades k is becoming increasingly competitive and attracting significant new entrants 
if we are unable to successfully compete for new business and contract renewals  our growth in revenues and operating margins may decline 
with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants  we expect this competition to intensify 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 we recognize revenues when the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of physical goods or rendering of services is complete  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
once these conditions are satisfied  the amount of revenues we record is determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we generate almost all of our revenues through long term contracts with virtual public schools 
these schools are generally funded by state or local governments on a per student basis 
under these contracts  we are responsible for providing each enrolled student with access to our ols  our online lessons  offline learning kits and student support services required for their complete education 
in most cases  we are also responsible for providing complete management and technology services required for the operation of the school 
the revenues derived from these long term agreements are primarily dependent upon the number of students enrolled  the extent of the management services contracted for by the school  and the level of funding provided to the school for each student 
we have determined that the elements of our contracts are valuable to schools in combination  but do not have standalone value 
in addition  we have determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each element of our contracts 
as a result  the elements within our multiple element contracts do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for revenues received under multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement based upon the approximate rate at which we incur the costs associated with each element 
we invoice virtual public schools in accordance with the established contractual terms 
generally  this means that for each enrolled student  we invoice their school on a per student basis for the following items access to our online school and online lessons  offline learning kits  and student personal computers 
we also invoice for management and technology services 
we apply sab no 
to each of these items as follows access to the k online school and online lessons 
our ols revenues come primarily from contracts with charter schools and school districts 
students are provided access to the ols and online lessons at the start of the school year for which they have enrolled 
on a per student basis  we invoice schools an upfront fee at the beginning of the school year or at the time a student enrolls and a monthly fee for each month during the school year in which the student is enrolled 
a school year generally consists of months 
the upfront fee is initially recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenues ratably over the remaining months of the current school year 
if a student withdraws prior to the end of a school year  any remaining deferred revenue related to the upfront fee is recognized ratably over the remaining months of the school year 
the monthly fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned 
the majority of our enrollments occur at the beginning of the school year in august or september  depending upon the state 
because upfront fees are generally charged at the beginning of the school year  the balance in our deferred revenue account tends to be at its highest point at the end of the first quarter 
generally  the balance will decline over the course of the year and all deferred revenue related to virtual public schools will be fully recognized by the end of our fiscal year on june offline learning kits 
our offline learning kit revenues come primarily from contracts with virtual public schools and our curriculum blends which online and offline content 
the lessons in our online school are meant to be used in conjunction with selected printed materials  workbooks  laboratory materials and other manipulative items which we provide to students 
we generally ship all offline learning kits to a student when their enrollment is approved and invoice the schools in full for the materials at that time 
once materials have been shipped  our efforts are substantially complete 
therefore  we recognize revenues upon shipment 
because offline learning kits revenues are recognized near the time of enrollment in its entirety  
table of contents we generate a majority of these revenues in our first fiscal quarter which coincides with the start of the school year 
student personal computers 
in most of our contracts with virtual public schools  we are responsible for ensuring that each enrolled student has the ability to access our online school 
to accomplish this  we generally provide each enrolled student with the use of a personal computer  complete technical support through our call center  and reclamation services when a student withdraws or a computer needs to be exchanged 
schools are invoiced on a per student basis for each enrolled student to whom we have provided a personal computer 
this may include an upfront fee at the beginning of the school year or at the time a student enrolls and a monthly fee for each month during the school year in which the student is enrolled 
a school year generally consists of months 
the upfront fee is initially recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenues ratably over the remaining months of the current school year 
if a student withdraws prior to the end of a school year  any remaining deferred revenue related to the upfront fee is recognized ratably over the remaining months of the school year 
all deferred revenue will be recognized by the end of our fiscal year  june the monthly fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned 
management and technology services 
under most of our school contracts  we provide the boards of the virtual public schools we serve with turnkey management and technology services 
we take responsibility for all academic and fiscal outcomes 
this includes responsibility for all aspects of the management of the schools  including monitoring academic achievement  teacher recruitment and training  compensation of school personnel  financial management  enrollment processing and procurement of curriculum  equipment and required services 
management and technology fees are generally determined based upon a percentage of the funding received by the virtual public school 
we generally invoice schools for management and technology services in the month in which they receive such funding 
we recognize the revenues from turnkey management and technology fees ratably over the course of our fiscal year 
we use months as a basis for recognition because administrative offices of the school remain open for the entire year 
to determine the amount of revenues to recognize in our fiscal year  we estimate the total funds that each school will receive in a particular school year  and our related fees associated with the estimated funding 
our management and technology service fees are generally a contracted percentage of yearly school revenues 
we review our estimates of funding periodically  and revise as necessary  amortizing any adjustments over the remaining portion of the fiscal year 
actual school funding may vary from these estimates or revisions  and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our results of operations 
since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year  we are generally able to base our annual revenues on actual school revenues 
as a result  on an annual basis  we have not had to make any material adjustments to our estimates of revenue over the last three years 
under most contracts  we provide the virtual schools we manage with turnkey management services and agree to operate the school within per enrollment funding levels 
this includes assuming responsibility for any operating deficits that the schools may incur in a given school year 
these operating deficits represent the excess of costs over revenues incurred by the virtual public schools as reflected on their financial statements 
the costs include our charges to the schools 
such deficits may arise from school start up costs  from funding shortfalls  from temporary or long term incremental cost requirements for a particular school  or due to specific one time expenses that a school may incur 
up to the level of school revenues  our collections are reasonably assured 
we consider the operating deficits to estimate any impairment of collection  and our recognized revenue reflects this impairment 
the fact that a school has an operating deficit does not mean we anticipate losing money on the contract 
we recognize the impact of these operating deficits by estimating the full year revenues and full year deficits of schools at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we amortize the estimated deficits against recognized revenues based upon the percentage of actual revenues in the period to total estimated revenues for the fiscal year 
we periodically review our estimates of full year school revenues and full year operating deficits and amortize the impact of any changes to these estimates over the remainder of our fiscal year 
actual school operating deficits may vary from these estimates or revisions  and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our results of operations 
since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year  we are generally able to base our annual revenues on actual school revenues and use actual costs incurred in our 
table of contents calculation of school operating deficits 
as a result  on an annual basis  we have not had to make any material adjustments to our estimates of realizable revenue over the last three years 
the amount of revenues we record is determined in accordance with eitf for the schools where we provide turnkey management services  we have determined that we are the primary obligor for substantially all expenses of the school 
accordingly  we report revenues on a gross basis by recording the associated per student revenues received by the school from its funding state or school district up to the expenses incurred by the school 
revenues are recognized when the underlying expenses are incurred by the school 
for the small percentage of contracts where we provide individually selected services for the school  we invoice on a per student or per service basis and recognize revenues in accordance with sab no 
under these contracts  where we do not assume responsibility for operating deficits  we record revenues on a net basis 
we also generate a small percentage of our revenues through the sale of our online courses and offline learning kits directly to consumers 
online course sales are generally month to month subscriptions or for periods of months and customers have the option of paying a discounted amount in full upfront or paying in monthly installments 
payments are generally made with charge cards 
for those customers electing to pay these subscription fees in their entirety upfront  we record the payment as deferred revenue and amortize the revenues over the life of the subscription 
for customers paying monthly  we recognize these payments as revenues in the month earned 
revenues for offline learning kits are recognized when shipped 
within days of enrollment  customers can receive a full refund  however customers terminating after days will receive a pro rata refund for the unused portion of their subscription less a termination fee 
historically  the impact of refunds has been immaterial 
we currently generate revenues from k international academy  although the amounts are immaterial 
these revenues are recognized based upon the products or services provided as described above 
capitalized curriculum development costs our curriculum is primarily developed by our employees and to a lesser extent  by independent contractors 
generally  our courses cover traditional subjects and utilize examples and references designed to remain relevant for long periods of time 
the online nature of our curriculum allows us to incorporate user feedback rapidly and make ongoing corrections and improvements 
for these reasons  we believe that our courses  once developed  have an extended useful life  similar to computer software 
we also create textbooks and other offline materials 
our curriculum is integral to our learning system 
our customers do not acquire our curriculum or future rights to it 
we capitalize curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance for the treatment of costs associated with computer software development and defines those costs to be capitalized and those to be expensed 
costs that qualify for capitalization are external direct costs  payroll  and payroll related costs 
costs related to general and administrative functions are not capitalizable and are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize curriculum development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility 
many of our new courses leverage off of proven delivery platforms and are primarily content  which has no technological hurdles 
as a result  a significant portion of our courseware development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of the courseware 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that a course can be produced to meet its design specifications 
capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
the period of time over which these development costs will be amortized is generally five years 
this is consistent with the capitalization period used by others in our industry and corresponds with our product development lifecycle 
included in capitalized curriculum development is the november purchase of a perpetual license of curriculum for million 
the purchase agreement includes a provision for future royalty payments 
this curriculum will be included as part of our high school offering and will be amortized over five years 
software developed or obtained for internal use we develop our own proprietary computer software programs to provide specific functionality to support both our unique education offering and the student and school management services 
these programs enable us to 
table of contents develop courses  process student enrollments  meet state documentation requirements  track student academic progress  deliver online courses to students  coordinate and track the delivery of course specific materials to students and provide teacher support and training 
these applications are integral to our learning system and we continue to enhance existing applications and create new applications 
our customers do not acquire our software or future rights to it 
we capitalize software development costs incurred during the development stage of these applications in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
these capitalized development costs are included in property and equipment and are generally amortized over three years 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets include property  equipment  capitalized curriculum and software developed or obtained for internal use 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our recorded long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we determine the extent to which an asset may be impaired based upon our expectation of the asset s future usability as well as on a reasonable assurance that the future cash flows associated with the asset will be in excess of its carrying amount 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
accounting for stock based compensation effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas no 
r only to awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning july  is based on the fair value of stock awards as of the grant date 
as we had used the minimum value method for valuing its stock options under the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 all options granted prior to july  continue to be accounted for under apb no 
we use the black scholes option pricing model method to calculate the fair value of stock options 
depending on certain substantive characteristics of the stock option  we  where appropriate  utilize a binomial model 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of the option 
option valuation models also require a determination of the fair value of our common stock at various dates 
as a public company  fair value is readily observable in the market price of our common stock 
before the completion of our ipo  such determinations required complex and subjective judgments 
during this pre ipo period  we considered several methodologies to estimate our enterprise value  including guideline public company analysis  an analysis of comparable company transactions  and a discounted cash flow analysis 
we also considered several equity allocation methodologies to allocate the estimate of enterprise value to our redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock including the current value method  the option pricing method  and the probability weighted expected return method pwerm 
the final valuation conclusion was based upon the pwerm equity allocation because it considers the value that would be attributable to each equity interest under different scenarios 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
prescribes the use of the asset and liability method 
table of contents to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts  using currently enacted tax laws 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established  based on the weight of available evidence  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of sufficient future taxable income 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
however  our ability to forecast sufficient future taxable income is subject to certain market factors that we may not be able to control such as a material reduction in per pupil funding levels  legislative budget cuts reducing or eliminating the products and services we provide and government regulation 
from inception through fiscal year  we had generated significant losses 
however  in the three years ending june  we generated increasing operating profit 
in addition  our revenues are dependent upon the number of student enrollments 
during the recruiting season for fall  we received enrollment applications that would provide for additional growth for fiscal year when considering this positive evidence of future profitability  we believed that our recent history of generating positive pre tax income is sustainable and is expected to continue to grow as a result of the increasing revenues primarily from virtual public schools 
consequently  as we believed that it is more likely than not that we would be able to utilize substantially all of our net deferred tax asset  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset for the year ended june  although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
as of june   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that expire between and if unused 
we maintain a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of million as of june  related to state income taxes as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize these deferred tax assets 
during  we changed our tax treatment of certain capitalized costs which resulted in an increase in its net operating loss carryforwards 
due to these net operating loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes in the next twelve months 
goodwill and other intangibles we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
the determination of fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired was determined by management utilizing various valuation methodologies 
intangible assets subject to amortization include trade names  domain names  and non compete agreements 
such intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are considered to be two years 
statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives  which is performed annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred 
the first step tests for impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the impairment 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or earlier when events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we have elected to perform our annual assessment on may st 
for the year ended june    and no impairment to goodwill was recorded

our revenues for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to revenues of million for the year ended june  average enrollments increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the same period prior year 
the increase in average enrollments was primarily attributable to enrollment growth in existing states 
new school openings in hawaii  indiana  oregon  and south carolina contributed approximately to enrollment growth 
in new and existing states combined  high school enrollments contributed approximately to enrollment growth 
high school enrollments increased and constituted approximately of our enrollments for the year ended june  as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
also contributing to the growth in revenues was the increase in the percentage of enrollments associated with managed schools  which generate higher revenue per enrollment than non managed school enrollments 
the percentage of enrollments associated with managed schools increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  instructional costs and services expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or as compared to instructional costs and services of million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in expenses to operate and manage the schools and a million increase in costs to supply curriculum  books  educational materials and computers to students  including depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs increased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the year ended june  this increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to four factors an increase in the percentage of managed school enrollments relative to total enrollments from to 
managed school enrollments generate more revenue than those associated with non managed schools  but have higher instructional costs as a percentage of revenues  an increase in the percentage of high school enrollments relative to total enrollments from to 
high school enrollments have higher costs as a percentage of revenues due to increased teacher and related services costs  incremental freight charges due to expedited student materials shipments and fuel surcharges  partially offset by reduced costs of student materials and computers  and start up costs associated with the commencement of school operations in four new states and two new schools in existing states 

table of contents selling  administrative  and other operating expenses 
selling  administrative  and other operating expenses for year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  administrative and other operating expenses of million for the year ended june  this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in student recruiting costs  a million increase in professional services  and a million increase in other expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  administrative  and other operating expenses decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  primarily due to greater leverage on our corporate overhead and fixed selling resources 
partially offsetting this leverage were increased investments in demand generating activities and our international expansion efforts 
product development expenses 
product development expenses for the years ended june  and were million 
employee compensation as well as contract labor costs increased  but were offset by greater utilization of these resources to develop curriculum assets 
as a percentage of revenues  product development expenses decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  as we were able to leverage these costs over a larger revenue base 
net interest expense 
net interest expense for the year ended june  was million  as compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended june  the increase is due to growth in our capital lease obligations partially offset by reduced borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
in addition  although our average cash balances were higher for the year ended june   the significant decline in interest rates resulted in lower interest income 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million  or of income before income taxes  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended june  the income tax benefit for the year ended june  reflects a million tax benefit as we were able to reverse the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets generated by our net operating losses that were fully reserved in prior periods 
had that reversal not occurred  we would have recorded an income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes for the year ended june  minority interest 
minority interest for the year ended june  was million  reflecting losses attributable to shareholders in our joint venture 
there was no minority interest for the year ended june  net income 
net income was million for the year ended june   compared to net income of million for the year ended june   a decrease of million 
excluding the million income tax benefit in fiscal year  net income as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the year ended june   as a result of the factors discussed above 
comparison of years ended june  and revenues 
our revenues for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to revenues of million for the year ended june  average enrollments increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the increase in average enrollments was primarily attributable to enrollment growth in existing states 
new school openings in georgia and nevada contributed approximately to enrollment growth 
in new and existing states combined  high school enrollments contributed approximately to enrollment growth 
in addition  we launched th and th grade in august attracting new students as well as prior year th grade students 
high school enrollments comprised approximately of our total average enrollment for the year ended june  as compared to in the prior period 
also contributing to the growth in revenues was a increase in average revenues per enrollment 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the percentage of enrollments associated with managed schools  which generate higher revenue per enrollment than non managed school enrollments 
the percentage of enrollments associated with managed schools increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  instructional costs and services expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or as compared to instructional costs and services of million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to a

as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs increased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the year ended june  the increase in instructional cost and service expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to an increase in enrollments associated with managed schools  which have higher costs as a percentage of revenues than non managed school  higher per student costs for high school because our instructional model has not yet attained scale  and higher costs to procure and supply materials due to greater than anticipated enrollments 
selling  administrative  and other operating expenses 
selling  administrative  and other operating expenses for year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  administrative and other operating expenses of million for the year ended june  this increase is primarily attributable to an million increase in personnel costs primarily due to increased headcount and a million increase in professional services 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  administrative  and other operating expenses decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  as we gained greater leverage on our corporate overhead and selling resources 
product development expenses

as a percentage of revenues  product development expenses decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  net interest expense 
net interest expense for the year ended june  was million  a decrease of million  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to interest income generated on the net cash proceeds from our ipo  partially offset by an increase in interest charges on increased capital lease obligations 
income taxes 
income tax benefit for the year ended june  was million compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended june  our provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million  or of income before income taxes 
the tax provision was offset by a million tax benefit we recognized as we were able to reverse the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets generated by our net operating losses that were fully reserved for in prior periods

while school administrative offices are generally open year round  a school typically serves students during a month academic year 
a school s academic year typically begins in august or september  our first fiscal quarter  and finishes in may or june  our fourth fiscal quarter 
consequently  our first and fourth fiscal quarters reflect fewer than three months of full school operations when compared to the second and third fiscal quarters 
in the first fiscal quarter  we ship materials to students for the beginning of the school year 
new students will enroll after the start of the school year  but in significantly smaller numbers 
this generally results in higher materials revenues and margin in the first quarter versus other quarters 
in the first and fourth fiscal quarters  online curriculum and computer revenues are generally lower as these revenues are primarily earned during the school academic year which may provide for only one or two months of these revenues in these quarters versus the second and third fiscal quarters 
management and technology service revenues are recognized ratably over the course of our fiscal year 
the combined effect of these factors results in higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter than in the subsequent quarters 
operating expenses are also seasonal 
instructional costs and services expenses increase in the first fiscal quarter primarily due to the costs incurred to ship student materials at the beginning of the school year 
instructional costs may increase significantly quarter to quarter as school operating expenses increase 
for example  enrollment growth will require additional teaching staff  thereby increasing salary and benefits expense 
school events may be seasonal  eg professional development  proctored exam related expenses  and community events  impacting the quarterly change in instructional costs 
the majority of our recruiting and selling expenses are incurred in the first and fourth fiscal quarters  as our primary enrollment season is july through september 
a significant portion of our overhead expenses does not vary with the school year or enrollment season 

table of contents discussion of seasonality of financial condition certain accounts in our balance sheet are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
as our enrollments and revenues grow  we expect these seasonal trends to be amplified 
the bulk of our materials are shipped to students prior to the beginning of the school year  usually in july or august 
in order to prepare for the upcoming school year  we generally build up inventories during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
therefore  inventories tend to be at the highest levels at the end of our fiscal year 
in the first quarter of our fiscal year  inventories tend to decline significantly as materials are shipped to students 
we generally have payment terms with our inventory suppliers  therefore the fourth quarter purchases of inventory typically will increase accounts payable  however this may be partially offset by occasional use of early payment discounts 
accounts receivable balances tend to be at the highest levels in the first quarter of our fiscal year as we begin billing for all enrolled students and our billing arrangements include upfront fees for many of the elements of our offering 
these upfront fees result in seasonal fluctuations to our deferred revenue balances 
in a few cases  virtual public schools may have funds to pay these invoices in a timely manner and this provides us with liquidity 
generally  deferred revenue has not been a significant source of funds to us since most schools receive their funding over the course of the year and pay their invoices in a corresponding manner 
since the upfront fees are charged to the schools at the time of enrollment  deferred revenue balances related to the schools tend to be highest in the first quarter  when the majority of students enroll 
since the deferred revenue is amortized over the course of the school year  which ends in june  the balance would be at its lowest at the end of our fiscal year 
the deferred revenue related to our direct to consumer business results from advance payments for twelve month subscriptions to our online school 
these advance payments are amortized over the life of the subscription and tend to be highest at the end of the fourth quarter and first quarter  when the majority of subscriptions are sold 
year end balances in deferred revenue are primarily related to the direct to consumer sales 
billings related to the direct to consumer sales are small relative to those of public virtual schools  however  they do represent a source of liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources we financed our operating activities and capital expenditures during the twelve months ended june  primarily through the use of cash on hand and capital lease financing 
as of june   and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million  respectively 
in december  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with pnc bank the credit agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we agreed that the proceeds of the term loan facility were to be used primarily for working capital requirements 
because of the seasonality of our business and timing of funds received  the school expenditures are higher in relation to funds received in certain periods during the year 
the credit agreement provides the ability to fund these periods until cash is received from the schools  therefore  borrowings against the credit agreement are primarily going to be short term 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based upon the term of the borrowings 
interest is charged  at our option  either at i the higher of a the rate of interest announced by pnc bank from time to time as its prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus  or ii the applicable london interbank offered rate libor divided by a number equal to minus the maximum aggregate reserve requirement which is imposed on member banks of the federal reserve system against eurocurrency liabilities plus the applicable margin for such loans  which ranges between and  based on the leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee which varies between and on the unused portion of the credit agreement depending on the leverage ratio 
the working capital line includes a million letter of credit facility 
issuances of letters of credit reduce the availability of permitted borrowings under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement contains a number of financial and other covenants that  among other things  restrict our and our subsidiaries abilities to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens or other security interests  make certain investments  become liable for contingent liabilities  make specified restricted payments including dividends  dispose of assets or stock  
table of contents including the stock of its subsidiaries  or make capital expenditures above specified limits and engage in other matters customarily restricted in senior secured credit facilities 
we must also maintain a minimum net worth as defined in the credit agreement and maximum debt leverage ratios 
these covenants are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions 
through june   we were in compliance with these covenants 
as of june   no borrowings were outstanding on the working capital line of credit and approximately million was outstanding for letters of credit 
on october   we amended the credit agreement to increase the borrowing limit from million to million under substantially the same terms 
this agreement expires on december  in september  the credit agreement with pnc bank  which expires in december  was renewed for an additional three year period expiring in december the credit agreement was renewed under substantially the same terms and increased the borrowing limit to million 
one of our subsidiaries has an equipment lease line of credit for new purchases with hewlett packard financial services company that expires on april  for new purchases on the line of credit 
the interest rate on new borrowings under the equipment lease line is set quarterly 
the rate on new borrowings for the three months ending october  is approximately 
for the year ended june   we borrowed million to finance the purchase of student computers and related equipment at an interest rate of approximately 
these leases include a month payment term with a bargain purchase option at the end of the term 
accordingly  we include this equipment in property and equipment and the related liability in capital lease obligations 
in addition  we have pledged the assets financed with the equipment lease line to secure the amounts outstanding 
upon the closing of the ipo  the holders of redeemable convertible series c preferred stock were paid a cash dividend of approximately million from the net proceeds of the offering 
the amount of the declared dividend was equal to the pro rata amount of the annual cumulative dividend that would have normally accrued on january  under the provisions of the series c preferred stock agreement 
also concurrently with the closing of the ipo  all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock thereby also eliminating the associated future annual dividend accrual 
a substantial portion of our revenues are generated through our contractual arrangements with virtual public schools 
the virtual public schools are generally funded on a per student basis by their state and local governments and the timing of funding varies by state 
the amount of funding is dependent upon per enrollment funding levels for the state and school enrollment 
the current economic recession has impacted funding levels 
we are aware of funding reductions for public education for the school year that will affect many of the virtual public schools we serve 
in conjunction with this  states are now submitting applications for federal education funds under the stimulus package  which provides significant allocations designed to alleviate reductions in critical spending on education 
in addition  there were mid year funding cuts to public education during fiscal year and there may be mid year reductions for fiscal year that affect our results of operations and cash flows 
funding receipts by an individual school may vary over the year and may be in arrears 
on rare occasions  we have experienced delayed payments 
because our receivables represent obligations indirectly due from governments  we have not historically had an issue with non payment and believe the risk of non payment is minimal although we cannot guarantee this will continue 
our cash requirements consist primarily of day to day operating expenses  capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to facility leases  capital equipment leases and other operating leases 
we expect capital expenditures for additional courses  new releases of existing courses and internal systems enhancements to remain relatively stable for the next two years and expenditures for computers to support virtual school enrollments to increase with enrollment growth 
we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash on hand  cash generated from operations and capital lease financing
