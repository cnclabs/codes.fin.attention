item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated products that address large and growing markets and are based on proprietary oral drug delivery technologies 
we have two product candidates in phase clinical trials 
in march  we initiated a phase clinical trial for dm  an extended release formulation of gabapentin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia that we have licensed to solvay 
in september and october  we initiated breeze and breeze  our phase clinical trials for dm  an extended release formulation of gabapentin for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes 
in february  we completed enrollment of our breeze clinical trial 
in  we expect to complete enrollment of our other phase clinical trials and report top line results for all three trials 
we seek to optimize the use and value of our product candidates and drug delivery technologies in three ways 
first  we are seeking to assemble a number of pharmaceutical products that can be highly differentiated from immediate release versions of the compounds upon which they are based and may be promoted together to women s health care providers 
our development of dm  and our retention of co promotion rights within the obstetrics gynecology field in our commercialization arrangements with covidien and santarus  are examples of this aspect of our business strategy 
second  we out license product candidates after we have increased their value through our formulation and clinical development efforts 
our dm license and development arrangement with solvay pharmaceuticals is an example of this strategy 
third  we enter into collaborative partnerships with other companies where the unique capabilities of our technology can provide superior value to a partner s product candidate  resulting in greater value for depomed than traditional fee for service arrangements 
our license and development arrangement with covidien is an example of this strategy 
we developed two additional products which have been approved by the fda and are currently marketed 
glumetza metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets is a once daily treatment for adults with type diabetes that we commercialize in the united states with santarus  inc proquin xr ciprofloxacin hydrochloride extended release tablets is a once daily treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections that we commercialize in the united states with watson pharma 
critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accrued liabilities  stock based compensation and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  and from license fees and royalties earned on license agreements and collaborative arrangements 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
product sales we sell glumetza product to wholesalers and retail pharmacies that is subject to rights of return within a period beginning six months prior to  and ending twelve months following product expiration 
we began shipping glumetza product to customers in the third quarter of prior to the third quarter of  we were unable to reasonably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment  and therefore  deferred revenue on product shipments of glumetza until the product was dispensed through patient prescriptions 
the quantity of prescription units dispensed was estimated based on analysis of third party information  including third party market research data and information obtained from wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and inventory movement 
based on the shipment trends  prescription trends and product returns history for glumetza over two years through the third quarter of and based on an analysis of return rates of companies with products that have similar characteristics and similar return policies within the metformin prescription market  we concluded that we had the information needed to reasonably estimate product returns during the third quarter of beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing revenue for glumetza sales as revenue at the time of shipment to our customers 
consequently  in  we recognized a one time increase of million in net product sales of glumetza  representing product sales previously deferred  net of estimated product returns  managed care and medicaid rebates  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  chargebacks and prompt payment discounts 
deferred costs related to shipments of glumetza previously deferred were also recognized to cost of sales 
this change resulted in a one time million reduction of net loss for revenues from glumetza product sales are recorded net of estimated product returns  managed care rebates  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs  chargebacks  and medicaid rebates 
these gross to net sales adjustments are recognized in the same period the related revenue is recognized and are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
we obtained the rights back from esprit to market proquin xr product in july  and began selling proquin xr to wholesalers and retail pharmacies in october given our limited history of selling proquin xr  we currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of proquin xr until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of the time proquin xr units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
we estimate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third party information  including third party market research data and information obtained from wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and inventory movement 
we have not had significant history estimating the number of patient prescriptions dispensed for proquin xr 
if we underestimate or overestimate patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period  adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods 
we have a deferred revenue balance of million at december  related to proquin xr product shipments that have not been recognized as revenue  which is net of wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts and 
table of contents prompt payment discounts 
we will recognize revenue for proquin xr upon the earlier of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until we can reliably estimate product returns  at which time we will record a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred 
in addition  the costs of manufacturing proquin xr associated with the deferred revenue are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenues from proquin xr product sales are recorded net of estimated wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  chargebacks and medicaid rebates 
these gross to net sales adjustments are recognized in the same period the related revenue is recognized and are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
product sales allowances we believe our estimates related to gross to net sales adjustments for wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs and chargebacks do not have a high degree of estimation complexity or uncertainty as the related amounts are settled within a relatively short period of time 
we believe that our estimated product return allowances and estimated rebates for glumetza require a high degree of judgment and are subject to change based on our experience and certain quantitative and qualitative factors 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing glumetza product sales at time title transfers to our customer  and provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
based on an analysis of return rates of companies with products that have similar characteristics and similar return policies within the metformin prescription market  as well as our historical returns  shipment trends  prescription trends and estimated distribution channel inventory levels  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the distribution channel which may be subject to product return 
our rebate accruals for glumetza are based on definitive contractual agreements after the dispensing of the product to a medical benefit plan participant 
rebates are accrued at the time of sale  and typically are paid out several months after the sale 
we estimate rebates based on current and anticipated future patient usage  the applicable contractual rebate rate amounts  and our estimates of the quantity of product in the distribution channel 
our product sales allowances and related accruals are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations of financial position 

table of contents a rollforward of our product sales allowances for the three years ended december   is as follows in thousands contract sales discounts product returns cash discounts total balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  includes wholesaler fees and retail discounts  launch discounts  patient support programs  managed care and medicaid rebates  and chargebacks 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing glumetza product sales at the time title transfers to our customer  and began providing for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
through december   the company was unable to reasonably estimate expected returns of product at the time of shipment of proquin xr product 
accordingly  the company currently defers recognition of revenue on product shipments of proquin xr  and deferred recognition of revenue prior to the third quarter of on product shipments of glumetza  until the earlier of when units were dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
product sales allowances related to revenue that has been deferred are recorded on the balance sheet as a reduction of the related deferred revenue  and recognized within the income statement as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized 
license revenue revenue from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations if any  of the licensee  is recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have substantially completed our obligations under the terms of the arrangement and our remaining involvement is inconsequential and perfunctory 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 

table of contents license fee payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development expense and accruals research and development expenses include related salaries  clinical trial costs  consultant fees and allocations of corporate costs 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations 
our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received from clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
if possible  we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from service providers 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff 
if we underestimate or overestimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods 
historically  our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred 
stock based compensation as of january   we began accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
for our volatility assumption  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options 
on adoption of fas r  we concluded that our historical share option exercise experience did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and estimated the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated by the simplified method in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab 
sab allowed for use of the simplified method to estimate expected term through december   and we used the simplified method to estimate the expected term for fiscal years and in december  the sec issued sab  which extended the ability for companies to utilize the simplified method beyond december  under limited circumstances 
however  we elected to no longer utilize the simplified method after december  at january   we concluded again that our historical share option exercise experience did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term because of limited exercise history 
for options granted after january   we have estimated the expected term by using the weighted average of a peer group of companies that grant options with similar vesting provisions 
the expected term used for options granted after january  is years 
as required  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
fas r requires that employee and director stock based compensation costs be recognized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line attribution method 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
prior to the adoption of fas r  pro forma information required under fas included forfeitures as they occurred 

table of contents results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized in the following table in thousands product sales glumetza proquin xr total product sales royalties glumetza proquin xr teva total royalties license revenue glumetza proquin xr acuform technology total license revenue collaborative and other revenue total revenues product sales glumetza as noted above under critical accounting policies revenue recognition  beginning in the third quarter of  we began to recognize glumetza product sales at the time title transfers to our customer  and provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
this resulted in a one time increase for the year ended december   of million in net product sales of glumetza  representing product sales previously deferred  net of estimated product returns  managed care and medicaid rebates  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  chargebacks and prompt payment discounts 
the additional increases in glumetza product sales in from  and in from  were primarily driven by increased penetration in the metformin prescription market  and to a lesser extent  price increases effective between and we began selling glumetza in the third quarter of in october  we terminated our promotion agreement related to glumetza with king pharmaceuticals and king s promotion obligations ended in december from february through september  we promoted glumetza through a contract sales organization 
product sales for glumetza relative to its current runrate will depend in part on the success of our promotion partner  santarus  which commenced promotion of glumetza in october 
table of contents proquin xr proquin xr product sales in related to our supply agreement with esprit in which we supplied esprit with commercial quantities of proquin xr 
we terminated the license and supply agreements with esprit in july and the marketing and distribution rights in the united states for proquin xr reverted back to us 
in october  we re launched proquin xr with watson  and began selling to wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of proquin xr until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of the time proquin xr units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
at december   we have a deferred revenue balance  which is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet  of million associated with the deferral of revenue on proquin xr product shipments  which is net of estimated wholesaler fees  retail pharmacy discounts  stocking allowances and prompt payment discounts 
the increase in proquin xr product sales in relates to a full year of selling proquin xr in as compared to a partial year of selling proquin xr in in february  we amended our promotion agreement with watson pharma related to proquin xr 
pursuant to the amended agreement  watson will perform a specified number of details in the first quarter of  and will make an agreed upon number of sales calls in which samples of proquin xr are delivered to physicians in each of the last three quarters of the agreement will terminate effective december   or upon notice from us to watson prior to that date 
we are currently evaluating our options for the future of proquin  which include seeking to divest proquin xr in the united states 
royalties glumetza glumetza royalties relate to royalties we received from biovail based on net sales of glumetza in canada and royalties we received from lg based on net sales of lg s version of glumetza  novamet gr  in korea 
we began receiving royalties from biovail in the first quarter of and from lg in the first quarter of ivax in april  we entered into a settlement and license agreement with teva related to the patent infringement lawsuit we initiated in january against teva affiliates ivax corporation and ivax pharmaceuticals  inc related to teva s generic glucophage xr tablets 
in connection with the settlement and license agreement we may receive up to million in future royalties on teva s generic glucophage xr product in the united states 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in royalty revenue related to this arrangement 
proquin xr our agreements with esprit provided for royalty payments by esprit to us of percent to percent of proquin xr net sales in the united states  based on escalating net sales and subject to certain minimum royalty amounts 
esprit s minimum royalty amount for was million and under our amended license agreement entered into in july  amounts paid by esprit for royalties were creditable against the minimum royalty obligation 
net sales of proquin xr by esprit for and did not reach levels that would obligate esprit to pay an amount greater than the minimum royalty obligation  and accordingly  esprit paid us million in total royalties for and in july  we terminated our license agreement with esprit  and esprit paid us 
table of contents million in royalties  representing a pro rated amount of minimum royalties that would have been due to us under the original agreements 
esprit is no longer obligated to pay us royalties on proquin xr sales 
license revenue glumetza glumetza license revenue for the year ended december  consisted primarily of license revenue recognized from the million license fee received from biovail in july and from the million upfront fee received from santarus in july we are recognizing the million license fee payment from biovail as revenue ratably until october  which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to royalties we are obligated to pay biovail on net sales of glumetza in the united states and for our obligation to use biovail as our sole supplier of the mg glumetza 
we are recognizing the million upfront payment from santarus as revenue ratably until october  which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to promotion fees we are obligated to pay santarus for glumetza in the united states 
we received a million upfront license fee from lg in august and a million milestone payment in november with respect to lg s approval to market lg s extended release metformin product that incorporates our acuform technology  novamet gr  in the republic of korea 
these payments were originally deferred and amortized as license revenue over the estimated length of time we were obligated to provide assistance in development and manufacturing 
in january  we amended our agreement with lg  granted lg a license to certain of the company s intellectual property rights to manufacture the mg novamet gr in exchange for royalties on net sales of novamet gr in korea  and removed the provisions of the original agreement providing for the supply of mg novamet gr tablets by us to lg 
under the amended agreement  we no longer have continuing performance obligations to lg  and recognized the remaining million of previously deferred license revenue in the first quarter of as a result of this one time recognition in  glumetza license revenue increased in as compared to  and decreased in as compared to proquin xr our license agreement with esprit for proquin xr provided for million in license fees from esprit 
we received million in license fees in july and an additional million in december the final million installment was paid in july the first million in license fees received were recognized as revenue ratably commencing on our receipt of the fees through june  which represented the length of time we were obligated to manufacture proquin xr under our proquin xr supply agreement with esprit 
in july  we and esprit terminated the license and supply agreements  and all deferred revenue related to license fees previously received from esprit was fully recognized as revenue in july  resulting in total recognition of million of license revenue related to our agreements with esprit in the third quarter of acuform technology in november  we entered into a license agreement with covidien granting covidien worldwide rights to utilize our acuform technology for the exclusive development of four undisclosed products 
through november  covidien paid us a total of million in upfront fees  representing a million upfront license fee and a million upfront payment for formulation work to be performed by depomed under the agreement 
the entire million is being accounted for as a 
table of contents single unit of accounting and being amortized ratably through november  which is the length of time depomed is obligated to perform formulation work under the agreement 
in february  we received million from biovail upon entering into a license and development agreement with biovail granting biovail an option to license our acuform drug delivery technology to develop and commercialize up to two pharmaceutical products 
we had no continuing performance obligations under the agreement and recognized the entire upfront license fee as revenue in the first quarter of solvay in february  we received a million upfront payment from solvay related to our license agreement for dm for phn 
we expect to recognize the million upfront payment beginning in the first quarter of ratably over the development and supply obligations under the agreement 
accordingly  we expect total license revenue to increase in from levels 
collaborative revenue collaborative revenue in represents a grant received by the michael j 
fox foundation in relation to our dm product candidate for parkinson s disease 
collaborative revenue decreased in from as a result of services performed for esprit  which were completed in cost of sales cost of sales consists of costs of active pharmaceutical ingredient  contract manufacturing and packaging costs  product quality testing  internal employee costs related to the manufacturing and supply process  distribution costs and shipping costs related to our product sales 
total costs of sales are summarized in the following table in thousands cost of sales cost of sales increased in over primarily as a result of an increase in glumetza product sales 
as noted above under critical accounting policies revenue recognition  beginning in the third quarter of  we began to recognize glumetza product sales at time title transfers to our customer 
this resulted in a one time increase of approximately million in costs of sales during the year ended december  cost of sales increased in over primarily as a result of an increase in glumetza product sales 
the costs of manufacturing associated with deferred revenue on proquin xr product shipments are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expense our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities and utilities 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in the early phases of research and development  as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore  
table of contents generally results in increasing expenditures until actual product launch 
total research and development expense for the each of the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands research and development expense dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year from through  the majority of our research and development expense was related to dm and dm programs 
the increase in research and development expense in from was primarily due to higher clinical research organization expenses with the commencement of breeze and breeze  our two phase clinical trials for dm for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes and our ongoing second phase clinical trial for dm for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia 
the decrease in research and development expense in from was primarily due to reduced expense related to the completion of our first phase clinical trial for dm for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia partially offset by the commencement of a phase clinical trial for dm for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes in we categorize our research and development expense by project 
the table below shows research and development costs for our major clinical development programs  as well as other expenses associated with all other projects in our product pipeline 
dm dm other projects total research and development expenses the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives as of march in addition to the products listed in the table below  from time to time we may enter into feasibility studies with collaborative partners that  if successful  may be followed by definitive agreements to advance development of the product candidate

dm postherpetic neuralgia second phase trial underway 
dm gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd proof of concept studies completed 
dm parkinson s disease phase trial ongoing 
one undisclosed compound confidential preclinical development ongoing 
we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to eight years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states  assuming that we are successful 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 

table of contents typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety  as required by the fda 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant expenses associated with clinical development derive from phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
in march  we commenced a phase trial for dm for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and in september and october  commenced two dm trials for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes  which we expect will result in increased research and development expense in the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after approval  which are known as phase trials 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses to support our operating activities  marketing and promotion expenses associated with glumetza  facility costs and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
total selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows selling  general and administrative expenses dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily due to a decrease of million in legal expenses primarily resulting from the resolution of our patent infringement case against ivax in april  offset by an increase of million in glumetza promotion fees in to santarus relative to glumetza promotion fees in to king 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in expense related to marketing costs associated with glumetza  an increase of million in legal fees due to our patent infringement case against ivax and an increase of million increase in promotion fees due to king under the promotion agreement related to glumetza 

table of contents we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will be higher in from levels  primarily driven by an expected full year of glumetza promotion fees for as compared to one quarter in  as we were obligated to begin paying santarus promotion fees beginning with the fourth quarter of promotion fee expense related to the santarus agreement was million for the fourth quarter of promotion fee expense related to our king agreement was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income and expense interest and other income interest expense net interest income expense interest and other income slightly increased in from as a result of higher investment balances  which was partially offset by lower interest rates on our investments 
interest income increased in over due to higher investment balances in interest expense in relates to interest on the credit facility we entered into in june with general electric capital corporation and oxford finance corporation 
gain on settlement with teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc in april  we entered into a settlement and license agreement with teva related to the patent infringement lawsuit we filed against teva affiliates ivax corporation and ivax pharmaceuticals  inc the settlement agreement provided for a one time payment to depomed of million  which has been classified a gain within operating income for the year ended december  gain on termination of king promotion agreement in conjunction with the termination and assignment agreement entered into with king in october  we received a million termination payment from king  of which million has been classified as a gain within operating income for the year ended december  gain on termination of esprit pharma agreement in conjunction with the termination and assignment agreement entered into with esprit in july  we received a million termination payment from esprit  which has been classified as a gain within operating income for the year ended december  series a preferred stock and deemed dividends in january  the company issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a price of  per share 
the series a preferred stock accrued a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock was convertible at anytime between january and january into the company s common stock 
the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was  however  as a result of the company s march and october financings  the conversion price had been adjusted to per share 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the series a preferred shareholder to resolve a misunderstanding between the company and the shareholder relating primarily to prior adjustments to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock 
pursuant to the agreement  among other matters  the company agreed to adjust the conversion price to per 
table of contents share 
the company and the shareholder also agreed to binding interpretations of certain other terms related to the series a preferred stock conversion price 
prior to december  the amounts calculated as series a preferred stock dividends were accounted for as an adjustment to the conversion price following eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios issue no 

as a result of the modifications to the preferred stock agreement in december  the company determined that a significant modification of the agreement had been made  and  therefore  a new commitment date for accounting purposes had been established on december  the company measured the difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock and the fair value of the modified preferred stock pursuant to eitf topic no 
d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock and determined that the fair value of the modified security was less than the carrying value of the security prior to the modification 
the company also evaluated the effective conversion rate  after considering the reset rate of per share in addition to the common stock issuable upon conversion of the unpaid  accumulated dividends 
the fair value of the underlying common stock on december  was per share 
the company determined that the conversion rate  after including the effect of the unpaid dividends  did not result in a beneficial conversion feature  which could have had the effect of also providing a deemed dividend to the preferred shareholder 
however  an anti dilution provision of the series a preferred stock was triggered by the company s january financing  which adjusted the conversion price of the series a preferred stock to 
as a result of the adjusted conversion price and an increase in the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock due to additional accumulated dividends  the series a preferred stock now contains a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to issue no 
in conjunction with the modification of the agreement  the company issued a warrant to the series a preferred shareholder 
the value of the warrant was considered in determining the value of the modified security 
the warrant was convertible into shares of the company s common stock during the period between january and january the conversion price of the warrant initially was  which was equal to the series a preferred stock conversion price in effect as of january  the conversion price of the warrant decreased by approximately per year during the conversion period  such that the number of shares of the company s common stock issuable upon conversion of the warrant increased by approximately per year 
the conversion of the warrant could be satisfied only by surrender of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock accrued dividends through january   which is the date the warrant initially became exercisable 
as a result of the issuance of the warrant  the preferred stock could be surrendered in exchange for common stock for an additional three years through january  as long as the series a preferred stock remained outstanding  the number of shares into which the warrant could be converted increased as the conversion price of the warrant decreased resulting in additional deemed dividends on the series a preferred stock 
for the years ended december   and we recognized series a preferred stock deemed dividends of approximately million  million and million  respectively  attributable to the beneficial conversion feature from the accrued dividends and decreasing warrant price 
in october  the holder of the series a preferred stock and warrant exercised its warrant to acquire shares of the company s common stock by surrendering its  shares of series a preferred stock in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the warrant was exercised in accordance with its terms and without any cash payment to the company  and together with surrender of the series a preferred stock  was convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share on the date of exercise 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands in february  we received a million upfront payment from solvay related to our license agreement for dm for phn 
since inception through december   we have financed our product development efforts and operations primarily from private and public sales of equity securities  upfront license and termination fees from collaborative and license partners  and product sales 
in december  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with azimuth opportunity  ltd  pursuant to which azimuth is committed to purchase  from time to time and at our sole discretion  up to the lesser of a million of our common stock  or b  shares of common stock 
in august  the agreement was amended and the term of the agreement was extended until december sales to azimuth under the agreement  if any  will be made at a price equal to the average closing price of our common stock over a given pricing period  minus a discount ranging from approximately to  which varies based on a threshold price set by us 
upon each sale of the our common stock to azimuth under the agreement  we have also agreed to pay reedland capital partners a placement fee equal to approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth 
azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock when the price of our common stock is below per share 
as of december   we have not sold any common stock to azimuth under this common stock purchase agreement 
in june  we entered into a credit facility with gecc and oxford 
the credit facility was available in up to three tranches 
the first tranche of million was advanced to us upon the closing of the loan agreement

we expect to continue to incur operating losses in we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit 
table of contents us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least the end of we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including sales of our marketed products  expenditures related to our commercialization and development efforts  financial terms of definitive license agreements or other commercial agreements we enter into  if any  results of research and development efforts  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  technological advances  results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  and acquisitions or investment in complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
we will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to conduct research and development programs  conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and manufacture or have manufactured and market or have marketed our marketed products and product candidates 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we have limited credit facilities and  except for the common stock purchase agreement with azimuth  we have no other committed sources of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements to continue our development programs 
we may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available we may have to delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  significantly curtail commercialization of our marketed products or other operations  and or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the inability to raise additional capital would have a material adverse effect on our company
