however  as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  current economic and financial market conditions have created a need for most reits  including us  to place a significant amount of emphasis on our financing and capital preservation strategy 
as such  our primary objective recently has been  and in the future will continue to be  the strengthening of our balance sheet  managing our debt maturities and conserving cash 
we ended with approximately million of cash and borrowing capacity

net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of this property were utilized to defease the related mortgage loan 
our share of the remaining proceeds were primarily used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility  spring mill medical  phase ii 
also in december  our owned consolidated joint venture sold spring mill medical  phase ii  a build to suit commercial asset located in indianapolis  indiana that was owned in our taxable reit subsidiary

the majority of the net proceeds from the sale of this property were used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
property acquisitions in addition to the purchase of our rivers edge shopping center  as discussed above  we also made the following property acquisitions in july  we purchased approximately acres of development land in holly springs  north carolina for million  which was financed with borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  on october   we purchased an additional acres of land adjacent to this location for approximately million  which was also financed with borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility 
these land parcels may be used for future development purposes  and in april  one of our consolidated joint ventures  in which we own an interest  purchased approximately four acres of land in indianapolis  indiana  commonly known as pan am plaza 
we funded the joint venture s purchase with borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility 
this land is situated across the street from the indiana convention center and adjacent to the recently constructed indianapolis colts football stadium 
the joint venture intends to develop restaurants and retail space on this property 
cash distributions in  we declared four quarterly cash distributions of per common share  or per common share on an annual basis 
business objectives and strategies our primary business objectives are to generate increasing cash flow  achieve sustainable long term growth and maximize shareholder value primarily through the operation  development and acquisition of well located community and neighborhood shopping centers 
we seek to implement our business objectives by focusing on the following strategies  each of which are described in more detail below operating strategy maximizing the internal growth in revenue from our operating properties by leasing and re leasing those properties to a diverse group of tenants at increasing rental rates  when possible  and redeveloping certain properties to make them more attractive to existing and prospective tenants or to permit additional or more productive uses of the properties  investment strategy using debt and equity capital prudently to redevelop or renovate our existing properties and to selectively acquire and develop additional shopping centers on land parcels that we currently own where we project that investment returns would meet or exceed expectations  and finance and capital strategy financing our capital requirements with borrowings under our existing credit facility and newly issued secured debt  internally generated funds and proceeds from selling properties that no longer fit our strategy  and by accessing the public securities markets when market conditions permit 
operating strategy 
our primary operating strategy is to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse tenant base 
most of our properties are in neighborhood trade areas with attractive demographics  which has allowed us to maintain occupancy rates and  in some cases  increase rental rates 
we seek to implement our operating strategy by  among other things maintaining an efficient property management and leasing strategy by emphasizing and maximizing rent growth and cost effective facilities  maintaining a diverse tenant mix in an effort to limit our exposure to the financial condition of any one tenant  maintaining strong tenant and retailer relationships in order to avoid rent interruptions and reduce marketing  leasing and tenant improvement costs that result from re tenanting space  increasing rental rates upon the renewal of expiring leases or re leasing of space to new tenants while minimizing vacancy to the extent possible  evaluating redevelopment and renovation opportunities that we believe will make our properties more attractive for leasing or re leasing to tenants  and taking advantage of under utilized land or existing square footage  or reconfiguring properties for better use 
we implemented our operating strategy in in a number of ways  including maintaining a diverse tenant mix with no tenant accounting for more than of our annualized base rent 
see item properties for a list of our top tenants by gross leasable area and annualized base rent 
as another example of our implementation of our operating strategy  in the third quarter of  we successfully transitioned our glendale town center property from our redevelopment portfolio to our operating portfolio  as the redevelopment work was substantially completed 
as of december   this property was approximately leased 
also  throughout  we transferred four additional properties rivers edge  courthouse shadows  four corner square  and bolton plaza into our redevelopment pipeline  as these properties are undergoing major redevelopment in an attempt to better meet our current and future tenants needs 
investment strategy 
while we currently focus on conserving capital  our investment strategy also includes the selective deployment of resources to projects that are expected to generate investment returns that meet or exceed our expectations 
we seek to implement our investment strategy in a number of ways  including successfully completing the construction and lease up of our development portfolio  maximizing the occupancy of our existing operating portfolio  redeveloping  renovating  expanding and or reconfiguring our existing operating properties  disposing of certain assets that no longer meet our long term investment criteria and recycling the capital  and continuing to selectively pursue the purchase of retail properties or portfolios and or land parcels in markets with attractive demographics that we believe can support retail development and therefore attract strong retail tenants 
in evaluating potential development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition opportunities  we consider a number of factors  including the expected returns on investments relative to our combined cost of capital in making such investment  as well as the anticipated risks in achieving the expected return  the configuration of the property  including ease of access  abundance of parking  maximum visibility  and the demographics of the surrounding area  the current tenant mix at the property or the potential future tenant mix that the demographics of the property could support  including the presence of one or more additional anchors  for example  value retailers  grocers  soft goods stores  office supply stores  sporting goods retailers  as well as an overall diverse tenant mix that includes restaurants  shoe and clothing retailers  specialty shops and service retailers such as banks  dry cleaners and hair salons  some of which provide staple goods to the community and offer a high level of convenience  the level of success of our existing investments  if any  in the same or nearby markets  the current and projected cash flow and market value of the property  and the potential to increase cash flow and market value if the property were to be successfully redeveloped  and the price being offered for the property  the current and projected operating performance of the property  the tax consequences of the sale and other factors 
we implemented our investing strategy in in a number of ways  including our recycling of capital during as evidenced by the december sale of two operating properties  silver glen crossing  a wholly owned community shopping center  and spring mill medical  phase i  an unconsolidated commercial property that was owned through a joint venture with a third party 
in addition  our owned consolidated joint venture sold spring mill medical  phase ii  a build to suit commercial asset located in indianapolis  indiana that was owned in our taxable reit subsidiary 
utilizing the net proceeds of these sales  we were able to generate net cash of approximately million  which was primarily used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  in february  we utilized the million of net proceeds from the november sale of our th meridian property to complete a like kind transaction under section of the internal revenue code and purchased rivers edge shopping center  a neighborhood shopping center located in indianapolis  indiana  for million 
the remaining million of the purchase price was financed initially through a draw on our unsecured credit facility and subsequently with a variable rate loan 
finance and capital strategy 
our primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost effective way 
we consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings  including the purchase price of properties to be developed or acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of our properties and our company as a whole upon consummation of the refinancing and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service 
as discussed in more detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the current market conditions has created a need for most reits  including us  to place a significant emphasis on financing strategies and capital preservation 
while these conditions continue  including the turmoil in the credit markets  our continuing efforts to strengthen our balance sheet are imperative to our business 
we seek to implement our financing and capital strategies in a number of ways  including prudently managing our balance sheet  including reducing the aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured credit facility so that we have additional capacity available to fund our development and redevelopment projects and pay down maturing debt if refinancing that debt is not feasible  extending or refinancing our borrowings maturing in and  managing our exposure to variable rate debt through interest rate hedging transactions  entering into new project specific construction loans  property loans  and other borrowings  using joint venture arrangements to access less expensive capital and to mitigate risk  and considering the raising of additional capital through the issuance of common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
we implemented our financing and capital strategy in in a number of ways  including completing an equity offering of  common shares at an offering price of per common share for net offering proceeds of approximately million  the majority of which were used to repay the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  as discussed above in significant activities  we have engaged in a number of financing and refinancing activities in as a result of these activities  we were able to reduce the amount outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility to million  net of additional borrowings  at december  from million at december  in addition  we reduced our maturities to million at december  business segments our principal business is the development  construction  acquisition  ownership and operation of high quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the united states 
we have aligned our operations into two business segments real estate operation and development  and construction and advisory services 
see note segment information in our notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for information on our two business segments and the reconciliation of total segment revenues to total revenues  total segment operating income to operating income  total segment net income to net income and total segment assets to total assets for the years ended december   and competition we believe that competition for the development  acquisition and operation of neighborhood and community shopping centers is highly fragmented 
we face competition from institutional investors  other reits and owner operators engaged in the development  acquisition  ownership and leasing of shopping centers as well as from numerous local  regional and national real estate developers and owners in each of our markets 
we also face significant competition in leasing available space to prospective tenants at our development and operating properties 
recent economic conditions have caused a greater than normal amount of space to be available for lease generally and in the markets in which our properties are located 
the actual competition for tenants varies depending upon the characteristics of each local market including current economic conditions in which we own and manage property 
we believe that the principal competi tive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location  demographics  price  the presence of anchor stores  and maintenance appearance of properties 
government regulation americans with disabilities act 
our properties must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
we believe our properties are in substantial compliance with the ada and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ada 
however  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one  and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect 
environmental regulations 
some properties in our portfolio contain  may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations may have released  or have the potential to release  such substances into the environment 
in addition  some of our properties have tenants which may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses 
in general  these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances  if any  in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances 
however  these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent 
finally  one of our properties has contained asbestos containing building materials  or acbm  and another property may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction 
environmental laws require that acbm be properly managed and maintained  and fines and penalties may be imposed on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
the laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
we are not currently aware of any environmental issues that may m aterially affect the operation of any of our properties 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage  and rental loss insurance that covers all properties in our portfolio 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss  the cost of the coverage  and industry practice 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god  and  in some cases  flooding 
some of our policies  such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods  are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses 
offices our principal executive office is located at s 
meridian street  suite  indianapolis  in our telephone number is employees as of december   we had full time employees 
of these employees  were home office executive and administrative personnel and were on site construction and maintenance personnel

item a 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
these factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows  and you should carefully consider them 
it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
we have separated the risks into three categories risks related to our operations  risks related to our organization and structure  and risks related to tax matters 
risks related to our operations current challenging conditions in the united states and global economy  the challenges being faced by our retail tenants and non owned anchor tenants and the decrease in demand for retail space may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are susceptible to adverse economic developments in the united states 
the united states is currently in a recession and this challenging economic environment may continue into the future 
there can be no assurance that government responses to disruptions in the economy and in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence 
general economic factors that are beyond our control  including  but not limited to  the current recession  decreases in consumer confidence  reductions in consumer credit availability  increasing consumer debt levels  rising energy costs  tax rates  increasing business layoffs  downsizing and industry slowdowns  and or rising inflation  could have a negative impact on the business of our retail tenants 
in turn  this could have a material adverse affect on our business because current or prospective tenants may  among other things i have difficulty paying us rent as they struggle to sell goods and services to consumers  ii be unwilling to enter into or renew leases with us on favorable terms or at all  iii seek to terminate their existing leases with us or seek downward rental adjustment to such leases  or iv be forced to curtail operations or declare bankruptcy 
we are also susceptible to other developments that  while not directly tied to the economy  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these developments include relocations of businesses  changing demographics  increased internet shopping  infrastructure quality  state budgetary constraints and priorities  increases in real estate and other taxes  costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation  decreasing valuations of real estate  and other factors 
in addition  because our portfolio of properties consists primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers  a decrease in the demand for retail space  due to the economic factors discussed above or otherwise  may have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
the market for retail space has been  and could continue to be  adversely affected by weakness in the national  regional and local economies  the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies  the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector  the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets  and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues or the internet 
to the extent that any of these conditions occur  they are likely to negatively affect market rents for retail space and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders 
because of our geographical concentration in indiana  florida and texas  a prolonged economic downturn in these states could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the united states economy is in a recession 
similarly  the specific markets in which we operate are currently facing very challenging economic conditions that will likely continue into the future 
in particular  as of december   approximately of our owned square footage and approximately of our total annualized base rent is located in the state of indiana  approximately of our owned square footage and approximately of our total annualized base rent is located in the state of florida and approximately of our owned square footage and approximately of our total annualized base rent is located in the state of texas 
this level of concentration exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned properties in numerous geographic regions 
these states are currently dealing with state fiscal budget shortfalls  rising unemployment rates  and home foreclosure rates that  in some cases  are above the national average 
continued adverse economic or real estate developments in indiana  florida  texas  or the surrounding regions  or any continued decrease in demand for retail space resulting from the local regulatory environment  business climate or fiscal problems in these states  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders 
recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing for development of our properties and other purposes on reasonable terms  or at all  and have other material adverse effects on our business 
the united states financial and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many financial instruments to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms  or at all  which may materially adversely affect our business 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
if we are not successful in refinancing our outstanding debt when it becomes due  we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain permanent financing on development projects we financed with construction loans or mezzanine debt 
our inability to obtain such permanent financing on favorable terms  if at all  could delay the completion of our development projects and or cause us to incur additional capital costs in connection with completing such projects  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategy 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
the disruptions in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and have other adverse effects on our business 
we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of december   which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund our growth 
required repayments of debt and related interest may materially adversely affect our operating performance 
we had approximately million of consolidated outstanding indebtedness as of december  at december   approximately million of this debt bore interest at variable rates approximately million when reduced by our million of interest rate swaps for fixed interest rates 
interest rates are currently low relative to historical levels and may increase significantly in the future 
if our interest expense increased significantly  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we use a combination of interest rate protection agreements  including interest rate swaps and locks  to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility 
this may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we also intend to incur additional debt in connection with future developments and acquisitions of properties 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
we may borrow new funds to develop or acquire properties 
in addition  we may incur or increase our mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by some or all of the real estate properties we develop or acquire 
we also may borrow funds if necessary to satisfy the requirement that we distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income  or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or otherwise avoid paying taxes that can be eliminated through distributions to our shareholders 
our substantial debt could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations by  among other things requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to pay interest  which reduces the amount available for distributions  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limiting our ability to borrow more money for operating or capital needs or to finance acquisitions in the future 
agreements with lenders supporting our revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan and various other loan agreements contain default provisions which  among other things  could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments or the termination of the facilities 
our revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan and various other debt agreements contain certain events of default which include  but are not limited to  failure to make principal or interest payments when due  failure to perform or observe any term  covenant or condition contained in the agreements  failure to maintain certain financial and operating ratios and other criteria  misrepresentations and bankruptcy proceedings 
in the event of a default under any of these agreements  the lender would have various rights including  but not limited to  the ability to require the acceleration of the payment of all principal and interest due and or to terminate the agreements  and foreclosure on the properties 
the declaration of a default and or the acceleration of the amount due under any such company credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company 
mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure  which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt 
as of december   a significant amount of our indebtedness was secured by our real estate assets 
if a property or group of properties is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage or lender could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of our investment 
also  certain of these mortgages contain customary covenants which  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property  to enter into new leases or materially modify existing leases  and to discontinue insurance coverage 
our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate substantial revenues from our properties 
in periods of economic slowdown or recession  such as the current period  rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur  could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of our common shares and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  other events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties 
these events include adverse changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  particularly in indiana  where approximately of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent is located  florida  where approximately of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent is located  and texas  where approximately of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent is located  local oversupply  increased competition or reduction in demand for space  inability to collect rent from tenants  vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms  changes in market rental rates  inability to finance property development  tenant improvements and acquisitions on favorable terms  increased operating costs  including costs incurred for maintenance  insurance premiums  utilities and real estate taxes  the need to periodically fund the costs to repair  renovate and re let space  decreased attractiveness of our properties to tenants  weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather related expenses  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  including those governing usage  zoning  the environment and taxes  civil unrest  acts of terrorism  earthquakes  hurricanes and other national disasters or acts of god that may result in underinsured or uninsured losses  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  changing demographics  and changing traffic patterns 
failure by any major tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us  because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
our leases generally do not contain provisions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants 
at any time  our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition  particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as what we are currently experiencing 
as a result  our tenants may delay lease commencements  decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration  fail to make rental payments when due  close a number of stores or declare bankruptcy 
any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenant s leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases 
in addition  lease terminations by a major tenant or non owned anchor or a failure by that major tenant or non owned anchor to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases 
in that event  we may be unable to re lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all 
the occurrence of any of the situations described above  particularly if it involves a substantial tenant or a non owned anchor with ground leases in multiple locations  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as of december   the five largest tenants in our operating portfolio in terms of annualized base rent were lowe s home improvement  publix  petsmart  the state of indiana  and marsh supermarkets  with annualized base rents for each representing     and  respectively  of our total annualized base rent 
we face potential material adverse effects from increasing numbers of tenant bankruptcies and we may be unable to collect balances due from any tenant bankruptcy 
bankruptcy filings by our retail tenants occur from time to time 
such bankruptcies may increase in times of economic uncertainty such as what we are currently experiencing 
the number of bankruptcies among us companies has increased significantly in and current economic conditions suggest this trend could continue or worsen 
similar to us businesses as a whole  bankruptcies of tenants renting space at properties in our portfolio increased sharply in we cannot make any assurance that any tenant that files for bankruptcy protection will continue to pay us rent 
a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant or the lease guarantor  or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant o r lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims  and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected 
as a result  it is likely that we will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold from a tenant in bankruptcy 
as an example of a recent bankruptcy by one of our significant tenants  in november  circuit city stores  inc filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws and  in january  declared that it would be liquidating and closing all of its stores 
as of december   circuit city leased space at three of our properties and represented a total of approximately of our total operating portfolio annualized base rent and approximately of our total operating portfolio owned gross leasable area 
at december   as a result of the liquidation  we wrote off all depreciable fixed assets and uncollected accounts and straight line rent receivables from circuit city  which reduced our net income by approximately million on a quarter and year to date basis 
we are continually re leasing vacant spaces resulting from tenant lease terminations 
the bankruptcy of a tenant  particularly an anchor tenant  may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties 
future tenant bankruptcies could materially adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy 
our financial covenants may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 
our unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  certain coverage ratios  as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt  make dividend payments  sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions 
these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions 
in addition  failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our current and future joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
as of december   we owned eight of our operating properties through joint ventures  one of which was accounted for using the equity method as we do not exercise requisite control for consolidation treatment 
for the twelve months ended december   the eight properties represented approximately of our annualized base rent 
in addition  one of the properties in our current development pipeline and two properties in our visible shadow pipeline are currently owned through joint ventures  one of which was accounted for under the equity method as of december  as we do not exercise requisite control for consolidation treatment 
we have also entered into an agreement with prudential real estate investors to pursue joint venture opportunities for the development and selected acquisition of community shopping centers in the united states 
these joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to ou r wholly owned properties  including the following we may share decision making authority with our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and the joint venture property  such as the sale of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners  prior consent of our joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture  our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture  our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of the property  disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture  which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the property such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved  and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments and the activities of a joint venture could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit  even though we may not control the joint venture 
in the future  we intend to co invest with third parties through joint ventures that may involve similar or additional risks 
we face significant competition  which may impede our ability to renew leases or re let space as leases expire  require us to undertake unbudgeted capital improvements  or impede our ability to make future developments or acquisitions or increase the cost of these developments or acquisitions 
we compete with numerous developers  owners and operators of retail shopping centers for tenants 
these competitors include institutional investors  other reits and other owner operators of community and neighborhood shopping centers  some of which own or may in the future own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located  but which have greater capital resources 
if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates  or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants  we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants leases expire 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  trading price of our common shares and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders may be materially adversely affected 
as of december   leases were scheduled to expire on a total of approximately of the space at our properties in in addition  increased competition for tenants may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise planned to make 
any unbudgeted capital improvements we undertake may reduce cash available for distributions to shareholders 
our future developments and acquisitions may not yield the returns we expect or may result in shareholder dilution 
we currently have three properties in our current development pipeline and six properties in our visible shadow pipeline 
new developments and acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including  but not limited to abandonment of development activities after expending resources to determine feasibility  construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition  and any representations we may receive from the seller  may fail to reveal various liabilities or defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired  which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition costs  financing risks  the failure to meet anticipated occupancy or rent levels  failure to receive required zoning  occupancy  land use and other governmental permits and authorizations and changes in applicable zoning and land use laws  and the consent of third parties such as tenants  mortgage lenders and joint venture partners may be required  and those consents may be difficult to obtain or be withheld 
in addition  if a project is delayed or if we are unable to lease designated space to anchor tenants  certain tenants may have the right to terminate their leases 
if any of these situations occur  development costs for a project will increase  which will result in reduced returns  or even losses  from such investments 
in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property  we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property 
if these new properties do not perform as expected  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the issuance of equity securities as consideration for any acquisitions could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable development projects or acquisitions that meet our investment criteria  which may impede our growth 
part of our business strategy is expansion through development projects and acquisitions  which requires us to identify suitable development or acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties or other assets that meet our development or acquisition criteria or in completing developments  acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms 
failure to identify or complete developments or acquisitions could slow our growth  which could in turn materially adversely affect our operations 
redevelopment activities may be delayed or otherwise may not perform as expected and  in the case of an unsuccessful redevelopment project  our entire investment could be at risk for loss 
we currently have five properties in our redevelopment pipeline 
we expect to redevelop certain of our other properties in the future 
in connection with any redevelopment of our properties  we will bear certain risks  including the risk of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs and make a project uneconomical  the risk that occupancy or rental rates at a completed project will not be sufficient to enable us to pay operating expenses or earn the targeted rate of return on investment  and the risk of incurrence of predevelopment costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
in addition  various tenants may have the right to withdraw from a property if a development and or redevelopment project is not completed on time 
in the case of a redevelopment project  consents may be required from various tenants in order to redevelop a center 
in the case of an unsuccessful redevelop ment project  our entire investment could be at risk for loss 
we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate and could  under certain circumstances  be required to pay certain tax indemnities related to the properties we sell 
real estate property investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
in connection with our formation at the time of our ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners of our operating partnership 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to the built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment 
the six properties to which our tax indemnity obligations relate represent ed approximately of our annualized base rent in the aggregate as of december  these six properties are international speedway square  shops at eagle creek  whitehall pike  ridge plaza shopping center  thirty south and market street village 
we also agreed to limit the aggregate gain certain limited partners of our operating partnership would recognize  with respect to certain other contributed properties through december   to not more than million in total  with certain annual limits  unless we reimburse them for the taxes attributable to the excess gain and any taxes imposed on the reimbursement payments  and to take certain other steps to help them avoid incurring taxes that were deferred in connection with the formation transactions 
the agreement described above is extremely complicated and imposes a number of procedural requirements on us  which makes it more difficult for us to ensure that we comply with all of the various terms of the agreement and therefore creates a greater risk that we may be required to make an indemnity payment 
the complicated nature of this agreement also might adversely impact our ability to pursue other transactions  including certain kinds of strategic transactions and reorganizations 
also  the tax laws applicable to reits require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may be unable to adjust our portfolio mix promptly in response to market conditions  which may adversely affect our financial position 
in addition  we will be subject to income taxes on gains from the sale of any properties owned by any taxable reit subsidiary 
potential losses may not be covered by insurance 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god  and  in some cases  flooding 
some of our policies  such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods  are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover all losses 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
insurance coverage on our properties may be expensive or difficult to obtain  exposing us to potential risk of loss 
in the future  we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices 
in addition  insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses  such as losses due to terrorist acts  environmental liabilities  or other catastrophic events including hurricanes and floods  or  if offered  the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified 
we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property  but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we cannot guarantee that material l osses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 
if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could seriously disrupt our operations  delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property 
events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 
rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions  particularly if such expenses are not off set by corresponding revenues 
our existing properties and any properties we develop or acquire in the future are and will be subject to operating risks common to real estate in general  any or all of which may negatively affect us 
the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties 
as a result  if any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses  we could be required to expend funds for that property s operating expenses 
as of december   our retail operating portfolio was approximately leased compared to approximately as of december  our properties continue to be subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates  utility costs  operating expenses  insurance costs  repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses  regardless of such properties occupancy rates 
therefore  rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions  particularly if such expenses are not off set by corresponding revenues 
we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination 
the cost of investigation  remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial  and the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
in connection with the ownership  operation and management of real properties  we are potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other related costs  including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property 
we may also be liable to third parties for damage and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate 
some of the properties in our portfolio contain  may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations may have released  or have the potential to release  such substances into the environment 
in addition  some of our properties have tenants that may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses 
in general  these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances  if any  in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages that we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances 
however  these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent 
finally  one of our properties has contained asbestos containing building materials  or acbm  and another property may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction 
environmental laws require that acbm be properly managed and maintained  and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
the laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
our properties must also comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 
we test our properties for compliance with applicable environmental laws on a limited basis 
we cannot assure you that existing environmental studies with respect to our properties reveal all potential environmental liabilities  any previous owner  occupant or tenant of one of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by other unrelated third parties  or future uses or conditions including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities 
inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
most of our leases contain provisions requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance 
however  increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses  as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents 
also  inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases or limits on such tenant s obligation to pay its share of operating expenses  which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending  which could impact our tenants sales and  in turn  our average rents  and in some cases  our percentage rents  where applicable 
our share price could be volatile and could decline  resulting in a substantial or complete loss on our shareholders investment 
the stock markets including the new york stock exchange  or the nyse  on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly operating results  changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication by securities analysts of research reports about us or our industry  additions and departures of key personnel  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestments  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours  the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies  an increase in market interest rates  which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds  changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts  and general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
a substantial number of common shares eligible for future sale could cause our common share price to decline significantly 
if our shareholders sell  or the market perceives that our shareholders intend to sell  substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market  the market price of our common shares could decline significantly 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had outstanding  common shares 
of these shares  approximately  are freely tradable  and the remainder of which are mostly held by our affiliates  as that term is defined by rule under the securities act 
in addition  approximately million units of our operating partnership are owned by certain of our executive officers and other individuals  and are redeemable by the holder for cash or  at our election  common shares 
pursuant to registration rights of certain of our executive offi cers and other individuals  we filed a registration statement with the sec in august to register  common shares issued or issuable upon redemption of units in our operating partnership in our formation transactions 
as units are redeemed for common shares  the market price of our common shares could drop significantly if the holders of such shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
risks related to our organization and structure our organizational documents contain provisions that generally would prohibit any person other than members of the kite family who  as a group  are currently allowed to own up to of our outstanding common shares from beneficially owning more than of our outstanding common shares or up to in the case of certain designated investment entities  as defined in our declaration of trust  which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise benefit our shareholders 
our organizational documents contain provisions that may have an anti takeover effect and inhibit a change in our management 
there are ownership limits and restrictions on transferability in our declaration of trust 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year 
to make sure that we will not fail to satisfy this requirement and for anti takeover reasons  our declaration of trust generally prohibits any shareholder other than an excepted holder or certain designated investment entities  as defined in our declaration of trust from owning actually  constructively or by attribution  more than of the value or number of our outstanding common shares 
our declaration of trust provides an excepted holder limit that allows members of the kite family al kite  john kite and paul kite  their family members and certain entities controlled by one or more of the k ites  as a group  to own more than of our outstanding common shares  so long as  under the applicable tax attribution rules  no one excepted holder treated as an individual would hold more than of our common shares  no two excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  no three excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  no four excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  and no five excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares 
currently  one of the excepted holders would be attributed all of the common shares owned by each other excepted holder and  accordingly  the excepted holders as a group would not be allowed to own in excess of of our common shares 
if at a later time  there were not one excepted holder that would be attributed all of the shares owned by the excepted holders as a group  the excepted holder limit would not permit each excepted holder to own of our common shares 
rather  the excepted holder limit would prevent two or more excepted holders who are treated as individuals under the applicable tax attribution rules from owning a higher percentage of our common shares than the maximum amount of common shares that could be owned by any one excepted holder  plus the maximum amount of common shares that could be owned by any one or more other individual common shareholders who are not excepted holders 
certain entities that are defined as designated investment entities in our declaration of trust  which generally includes pension funds  mutual funds  and certain investment management companies  are permitted to own up to of our outstanding common shares  so long as each beneficial owner of the shares owned by such designated investment entity would satisfy the ownership limit if those beneficial owners owned directly their proportionate share of the common shares owned by the designated investment entity 
our board of trustees may waive the ownership limit or the designated investment entity limit for a shareholder that is not an individual if such shareholder provides information and makes representations to the board that are satisfactory to the board  in its reasonable discretion  to establish that such pe rson s ownership in excess of the limit or the limit  as applicable  would not jeopardize our qualification as a reit 
in addition  our declaration of trust contains certain other ownership restrictions intended to prevent us from earning income from related parties if such income would cause us to fail to comply with the reit gross income requirements 
the various ownership restrictions may discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or control that might involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders  or compel a shareholder who has acquired our shares in excess of these ownership limitations to dispose of the additional shares and  as a result  to forfeit the benefits of owning the additional shares 
any acquisition of our common shares in violation of these ownership restrictions will be void ab initio and will result in automatic transfers of our common shares to a charitable trust  which will be responsible for selling the common shares to permitted transferees and distributing at least a portion of the proceeds to the prohibited transferees 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue up to  preferred shares  having those preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to distributions  qualifications  or terms or conditions of redemption as determined by our board 
thus  our board could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of our shares 
in addition  any preferred shares that we issue likely would rank senior to our common shares with respect to payment of distributions  in which case we could not pay any distributions on our common shares until full distributions were paid with respect to such preferred shares 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other possible anti takeover provisions 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or the removal of existing management and  as a result  could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and our board of trustees power to reclassify shares and issue additional common shares or preferred shares and the absence of cumulative voting rights 
certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit changes in control 
certain provisions of maryland law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares  including business combination moratorium fair price provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested shareholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and thereafter imposes stringent fair price and super majority shareholder voting requirements on these combinations  and control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company defined as shares which  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the shareholder  entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares from a party other than the issuer have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares  and are subject to redemption in certain circumstances 
we have opted out of these provisions of maryland law 
however  our board of trustees may opt to make these provisions applicable to us at any time 
certain officers and trustees may have interests that conflict with the interests of shareholders 
certain of our officers and members of our board of trustees own limited partner units in our operating partnership 
these individuals may have personal interests that conflict with the interests of our shareholders with respect to business decisions affecting us and our operating partnership  such as interests in the timing and pricing of property sales or refinancings in order to obtain favorable tax treatment 
as a result  the effect of certain transactions on these unit holders may influence our decisions affecting these properties 
certain members of our executive management team have outside business interests that could require time and attention 
certain members of our executive management team own interests in properties that are not part of our company 
these properties include a room indianapolis hotel and condominium development that opened in and various outlots and land parcels that are held for sale 
in some cases  one or more of these individuals or their affiliates will have certain management and fiduciary obligations that may conflict with such person s responsibilities as an officer or trustee of our company and may adversely affect our operations 
departure or loss of our key officers could have an adverse effect on us 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of our existing executive officers 
our executive officers experience in real estate acquisition  development and finance are critical elements of our future success 
we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers that provided for a term that ended in december  with automatic one year renewals unless either we or the officer elects not to renew the agreement 
these agreements were automatically renewed for our three remaining executive officers through december  if one or more of our key executives were to die  become disabled or otherwise leave the company s employ  we may not be able to replace this person with an executive officer of equal skill  ability  and industry expertise 
until suitable replacements personnel could be identified and hired  if at all  our operations and financ ial condition could be impaired 
we depend on external capital to fund our capital needs 
to qualify as a reit  we will be required to distribute to our shareholders each year at least of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains 
in order to eliminate federal income tax  we will be required to distribute annually of our net taxable income  including capital gains 
partly because of these distribution requirements  we will not be able to fund all future capital needs  including capital for property development and acquisitions  with income from operations 
we therefore will have to rely on third party sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of things  including the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and our ability to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited 
maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
our declaration of trust and bylaws require us to indemnify our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the extent permitted by maryland law 
as a result  we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our trustees and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 
accordingly  in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our trustees or officers impede the performance of our company  our shareholders ability to recover damages from such trustee or officer will be limited 
our shareholders have limited ability to prevent us from making any changes to our policies that they believe could harm our business  prospects  operating results or share price 
our board of trustees has adopted policies with respect to certain activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of our board of trustees without a vote of our shareholders 
this means that our shareholders will have limited control over changes in our policies 
such changes in our policies intended to improve  expand or diversify our business may not have the anticipated effects and consequently may adversely affect our business and prospects  results of operations and share price 
tax risks failure of our company to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to us and our shareholders 
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  we intend to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit  but we cannot assure shareholders that we will qualify as a reit 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit  and the statements in this annual report on form k are not binding on the irs or any court 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our shareholders 
many of the reit requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from speci fic passive sources  such as rent  that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
in addition  to qualify as a reit  we cannot own specified amounts of debt and equity securities of some issuers 
we also are required to distribute to our shareholders with respect to each year at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and joint ventures further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status and  given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits and the ongoing importance of factual determinations  we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to qualify as a reit 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new rulings  that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the internal revenue code  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
as a taxable corporation  we would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income or pass through long term capital gains to individual shareholders at favorable rates 
we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 
we would not be able to elect to be taxed as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify unless the irs were to grant us relief under certain statutory provisions 
if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes  which would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  such failure would cause an event of default under our credit facility and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and to service our debt 
this likely would have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and the value of our securities 
in addition  we would no longer be required to pay any distributions to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the statutory savings provisions in order to maintain our reit status  we would nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of  or more for each such failure 
we will pay some taxes even if we qualify as a reit 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains 
additionally  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
moreover  if we have net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
while we will undertake sales of assets if those assets become inconsistent with our long term strategic or return objectives  we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions  but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 
the need to avoid prohibited transactions could cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that our predecessors otherwise would have sold or that it might otherwise be in our best interest to sell 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable reit subsidiaries  or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from our taxable reit subsidiaries  will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax 
we have elected to treat kite realty holdings  llc as a taxable reit subsidiary  and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrang ements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  we will have less cash available for distributions to our shareholders

we also derive revenues from providing management  leasing  real estate development  construction and real estate advisory services through our taxable reit subsidiary

in addition to our current development and redevelopment pipelines  we have a visible shadow development pipeline which includes land parcels that are undergoing pre development activity and are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financings 
as of december   this visible shadow pipeline consisted of six projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet of total gross leasable area upon completion 
finally  as of december   we also owned interests in other land parcels comprising approximately acres that may be used for future expansion of existing properties  development of new retail or commercial properties or sold to third parties 
these land parcels are classified as land held for development in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
current economic conditions and impact on our retail tenants was a very difficult year for the us economy  businesses and consumers 
initial weakness in the housing market in escalated into a credit crisis whereby businesses and consumers had difficulty obtaining financing on favorable terms  if at all 
these conditions accelerated the deterioration of the us economy  and in late the national bureau of economic research  a group of economists that characterize american business cycles  declared that a recession began in the us in december throughout and into the first quarter of  the us economy continued to struggle with difficult market conditions  including a shortage of financing  decreased home values and increased home foreclosures  rising unemployment rates  personal and business bankruptcies  and sharp declines in consumer confidence 
the us congress  the new presidential administration  which took office in january  and t he federal reserve bank have taken various steps in an effort to curtail the recession and promote stability in the us economy as a whole 
it is not yet known what effect  if any  these stimulus packages and other governmental and monetary packages will have on financial institutions and markets or the economy 
these difficult economic conditions had a negative impact on consumer spending during  and we expect these conditions to continue into and possibly beyond 
factors contributing to consumers spending less at stores owned and or operated by our retail tenants include  among others shortage or unavailability of financing lending institutions have substantially tightened credit standards  making it significantly more difficult for individuals and companies to obtain financing 
the shortage of financing has caused  among other things  consumers to have less disposable income available for retail spending 
decreased home values and increased home foreclosures us home values have decreased sharply  and difficult economic conditions have also contributed to a record number of home foreclosures 
the historically high level of delinquencies and foreclosures  particularly among sub prime mortgage borrowers  is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
rising unemployment rates the us unemployment rate continues to rise dramatically 
according to the bureau of labor statistics  in  approximately million americans became unemployed  the highest level in more than six decades 
a total of approximately million of these jobs were lost in the last four months of  with over half a million lost in december alone 
this trend continued through january and february  with unemployment rising to approximately million americans  or  the highest level in years 
rising unemployment rates could cause further decreases in consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the businesses of our retail tenants 
deceasing consumer confidence consumer confidence is at its lowest level in decades  leading to consumers spending less money on discretionary purchases 
the significant increase during in both personal and business bankruptcies reflects an economy in distress  with financially over extended consumers less likely to purchase goods and or services from our retail tenants 
during  decreasing consumer spending had a negative impact on the businesses of our retail tenants 
for example  same store sales for many retailers declined in late  particularly in november and december 
as discussed below  these conditions in turn had a negative impact on our business 
to the extent these conditions persist or deteriorate further  our tenants may be required to curtail or cease their operations  which could materially and negatively affect our business in general and our cash flow in particular 
impact of economy on reits  including us as an owner and developer of community and neighborhood shopping centers  our operating and financial performance is directly affected by economic conditions in the retail sector of those markets in which our operating centers and development properties are located 
this is particularly true in the states of indiana  florida and texas  where the majority of our properties are located  and in north carolina  where a significant portion of our development projects and land parcels held for development are located 
as discussed above  due to the challenges facing us consumers  the operations of many of our retail tenants are being negatively affected 
in turn  this is having a negative impact on our business  including in the following ways difficulty in collecting rent  rent adjustments 
when consumers spend less  our tenants typically experience decreased revenues and cash flows 
this makes it more difficult for some of our tenants to pay their rent obligations  which is the primary source of our revenues 
the number of tenants requesting decreases or deferrals in their rent obligations increased in if granted  such decreases or deferrals negatively affect our cash flows 
termination of leases 
if our tenants continue to struggle to meet their rental obligations  they may be forced to terminate their leases with us 
during  several tenants terminated their leases with us and in some cases we were able to negotiate lease termination fees from these tenants but in other cases we were not 
tenant bankruptcies 
the number of bankruptcies by us businesses surged in the third and fourth quarter of this trend continued through january and february and may continue into the foreseeable future 
likewise  bankruptcies of our retail tenants also increased sharply in and into for example  in november  circuit city stores  inc filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws and  in january  declared that it would be liquidating and closing all of its stores 
as of december   circuit city leased space at three of our properties and represented a total of approximately of our total operating portfolio annualized base rent and approximately of our total operating portfolio owned gross leasable area 
as a result of the liquidation  we wrote off all assets and uncollected amounts from circuit city in december  whi ch reduced our net income by approximately million 
decrease in demand for retail space 
reflecting the extremely difficult current market conditions  demand for retail space at our shopping centers has decreased while availability has increased due to tenant terminations and bankruptcies 
as a result  the overall tenancy at our shopping centers declined over the last months and may continue to decline in the future until financial markets  consumer confidence  and the economy stabilize 
as of december   our retail operating portfolio was approximately leased compared to approximately leased as of december  in addition  these conditions have made it significantly more difficult for us to lease space in our development projects  which may adversely affect the expected returns from these projects or delay their completion 
the factors discussed above  among others  had a negative impact on our business during we expect that these conditions may continue well into the foreseeable future 
financing strategy and maturities our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature has also been affected by the condition of the economy in general and by the current instability of the financial markets in particular 
as of december   approximately million of our consolidated indebtedness was scheduled to mature in approximately million including our share of unconsolidated debt  excluding scheduled monthly principal payments for we believe we have good relationships with a number of banks and other financial institutions that will allow us to refinance these borrowings with the existing lenders or replacement lender 
however  in this current challenging environment  it is imperative that we identify alternative sources of financing and other capital in the event we are not able to refin ance these loans on satisfactory terms  or at all 
it is also important for us to obtain financing in order to complete our development and redevelopment projects 
to strengthen our balance sheet  we engaged in certain financing transactions in specifically  we have raised a combined million in proceeds from a new term loan that matures in july and from an offering of  of our common shares 
these funds were primarily used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility  which created additional availability under this facility to pay down borrowings as they mature  if necessary 
as of december   approximately million was available to be drawn under this facility and we had an additional approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
in addition to raising new capital  we have also been successful in obtaining extensions for loans originally maturing in as part of our financing strategy  we will continue to seek to refinance and or extend our debt that is maturing in and for example  in october  we negotiated the extension of the maturity dates from to on our debt at four of our consolidated properties estero town center  tarpon springs plaza  rivers edge shopping center  and bridgewater marketplace 
in addition  in october and december  we refinanced debt at our gateway shopping center and bayport commons properties  respectively  and extended the maturity dates from to as a result of these actions  we extended the maturity dates to or later on approximately million of indebtedness originally due in while we can give no assurance  due to these efforts and the current status of negotiations with existing and alternative lenders for our near term maturing indebtedness  we currently believe we will have the ability to extend  refinance  or repay all of our debt that is maturing through at least  including  to the extent necessary  utilizing the availability on our unsecured credit facility 
obtaining new financing also is important to our business due to the capital needs of our existing development and redevelopment projects 
the properties in our development and redevelopment pipelines  which are primary drivers for our near term growth  will require a substantial amount of capital to complete 
as of december   our unfunded share of the total estimated cost of the properties in our current development and redevelopment pipelines was approximately million 
while we believe we will have access to sufficient funding to be able to fund our investments in these projects through a combination of new and existing construction loans and draws on our unsecured credit facility which  as noted above  has million of availability as of december   a prolonged credit crisis will make it more costly and difficult to raise additional capital  if necessary 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
purchase accounting the purchase price of operating properties is allocated to tangible assets and identified intangibles acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

in making estimates of fair values for the purpose of allocating purchase price  a number of sources are utilized 
we also consider information about each property obtained as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of tangible assets and intangibles acquired 
a portion of the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets and intangibles  including the fair value of the building on an as if vacant basis and to land determined by real estate tax assessments  independent appraisals  or other relevant data  above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over the remaining non cancelable term of the leases 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income  and the value of leases acquired 
we utilize independent sources for our estimates to determine the respective in place lease values 
our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements  leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated lease up period as if the space was vacant 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
we also consider whether a portion of the purchase price should be allocated to in place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value 
characteristics we consider in allocating these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
to date  a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value 
beginning fiscal year  we will apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r business combinations revised to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
sfas no 
r will require us to measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired 
sfas no 
r will modify sfas no 
s cost allocation process  which currently requires the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r requires the costs of an acquisition to be recognized in the period incurred 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
capitalization of certain pre development and development costs we incur costs prior to land acquisition and for certain land held for development  including acquisition contract deposits as well as legal  engineering and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
these pre development costs are capitalized and included in construction in progress in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that the completion of a development project is no longer probable  all previously incurred pre development costs are immediately expensed 
we also capitalize costs such as construction  interest  real estate taxes  and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved with the development of our properties 
as a portion of the development property becomes operational  we expense appropriate costs on a pro rata basis 
impairment of investment properties in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 management reviews investment properties for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable 
impairment analysis requires management to make certain assumptions and requires significant judgment 
management does not believe any investment properties were impaired at december  impairment losses for investment properties are recorded when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 operating properties held for sale include only those properties available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year 
operating properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held for sale period 
our properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished 
the operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations  and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition 
when material  prior periods are reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
revenue recognition as lessor  we retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases 
contractual minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
a small number of our lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenant s sales volume contingent percentage rent 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified sales targets as defined in their lease agreements 
percentage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expense is incurred 
gains and losses on sales of real estate are recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sale of real estate 
in summary  gains and losses from sales are not recognized unless a sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property and the collectability of any receivable from the sale is reasonably assured 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
project costs include all direct labor  subcontract  and material costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance costs incurred to date 
project costs do not include uninstalled materials 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income  which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
development fees and fees from advisory services are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services are rendered 
performance based incentive fees are recorded when the fees are earned 
fair value measurements on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements  accordingly  the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumption s based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
as further discussed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the only assets or liabilities that we record at fair value on a recurring basis are interest rate hedge agreements 
to comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties 
however  as of december   we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
income taxes and reit compliance we are considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes and qualify as a reit 
as such  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we may also be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income even if we do qualify as a reit 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains 
results of operations at december   we owned interests in operating properties consisting of retail properties  three operating commercial properties and an associated parking garage and eight entities that held development or redevelopment properties in which we have an interest 
these redevelopment properties include shops at eagle creek  bolton plaza  courthouse shadows  and four corner square properties  all of which are undergoing major redevelopment  and rivers edge  a shopping center purchased in february that we intend to redevelop 
of the total properties held at december   one operating property and one parcel of pre development land were owned through joint ventures and accounted for under the equity method 
at december   we owned interests in operating properties consisting of retail properties  four commercial operating properties and an associated parking garage and had interests in entities that held development or redevelopment properties 
these redevelopment properties included our glendale town center and shops at eagle creek properties  which were both undergoing major redevelopment 
of the total properties held at december   two operating properties were owned through joint ventures that were accounted for under the equity method 
at december   we owned interests in operating properties consisting of retail properties  four commercial operating properties and an associated parking garage and had properties under development 
of the total properties held at december   two operating properties were owned through joint ventures that were accounted for under the equity method 
the comparability of results of operations is significantly affected by our development  redevelopment  and operating property acquisition and disposition activities in  and therefore  we believe it is most useful to review the comparisons of our  and results of operations as set forth below under comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and and comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and in conjunction with the discussion of our significant development  redevelopment  and operating property acquisition and disposition activities during those periods  which such discussion is set forth directly below

however  for purposes of the comparison of operating results  this property is classified as property acquired during in the comparison of operating results tables below 
to fund the purchase price  we utilized approximately million of proceeds from the november sale of our th meridian property  as discussed below 
the remaining purchase price of million was funded initially through a draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility and subsequently refinanced with a variable rate loan bearing interest at libor basis points and originally maturing on february  in october  we extended the maturity date on this loan one additional year

liquidity and capital resources current state of capital markets and our financing strategy our primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost effective way 
we consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings  including the purchase price of properties to be developed or acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of our properties and our company as a whole upon consummation of the refinancing and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service 
as discussed in more detail above in overview  the challenging market conditions that currently exist have created a need for most reits  including us  to place a significant amount of emphasis on financing and capital strategies 
in  we reduced the aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured credit facility in an effort to have that source of financing available to fund our development and redevelopment projects and pay down maturing debt 
in july and august  we obtained million of proceeds from a term loan that matures in july  as described in more detail below  majority of the proceeds of which were used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  in october  we completed an offering of our common shares that raised approximately million of net proceeds  the majority of which was used to pay down outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility 
as a result  approximately million was available under that f acility as of december  in addition to raising new capital  we have also been successful in refinancing or extending the maturities of a significant portion of our debt that is scheduled to mature in for example  in october  we extended the maturity dates from to on our debt at four of our consolidated properties estero town center  tarpon springs plaza  rivers edge shopping center  and bridgewater marketplace 
in addition  in october and december  we refinanced debt at our gateway shopping center and bayport commons properties  respectively  and extended the maturity dates from to as a result of these actions  we extended the maturity dates to or later on approximately million of indebtedness previously due in we continue to conduct negotiations with our existing and potential replacement lenders to refinance or obtain extensions on our remaining maturities  which total approximately million approximately million when including our share of unconsolidated debt at december   excluding scheduled monthly principal payments for while we can give no assurance  due to these efforts and the current status of negotiations with existing and alternative lenders for our near term maturing indebtedness  we currently believe we will have the ability to extend  refinance  or repay all of our debt that is maturing through at least we were also able to effectively recycle capital by selling two of our operating properties  which is another aspect of our financing strategy 
in december we sold our silver glen crossing property  a wholly owned property in our retail portfolio  and spring mill medical  phase i  an unconsolidated commercial property that was owned through a joint venture with a third party 
in addition  our owned consolidated joint venture sold spring mill medical  phase ii  a build to suit commercial asset located in indianapolis  indiana that was owned in our taxable reit subsidiary 
utilizing the net proceeds of these sales  we were able to generate net cash of approximately million  which was primarily used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in the future  we may raise additional capital by pursuing joint venture capital partners and or disposing of additional properties that are no longer a core component of our growth strategy 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million 
we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk with regards to our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
from time to time  such investments may temporarily be in excess of fdic and sipc insurance limits  however we attempt to limit our exposure at any one time 
our principal capital resources our unsecured revolving credit facility our operating partnership has entered into an amended and restated four year million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders and key bank national association  as agent the unsecured facility 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured facility was approximately million  bearing interest at a rate of libor plus basis points 
factoring in our hedge agreements  at december   our weighted average interest rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility was approximately 
the amount that we may borrow under the unsecured facility is based on the value of assets in the unencumbered property pool 
we currently have unencumbered properties and other assets  of which are wholly owned and used to calculate the amount available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility and two of which are owned through joint ventures 
the major unencumbered assets include broadstone station  courthouse shadows  eagle creek lowes  eastgate pavilion  four corner square  hamilton crossing  king s lake  market street village  naperville marketplace  pen products  publix at acworth  red bank commons  shops at eagle creek  traders point ii  union station parking garage  wal mart plaza  and waterford lakes 
as of december  the amounts available to us for future draws was approximately million 
we and several of the operating partnership s subsidiaries are guarantors of the operating partnership s obligations under the unsecured facility 
the unsecured facility has a maturity date of february   with an option for a one year extension 
borrowings under the unsecured facility bear interest at a variable interest rate of libor plus to basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
the unsecured facility has a to commitment fee applicable to the average daily unused amount 
subject to certain conditions  including the prior consent of the lenders  we have the option to increase our borrowings under the unsecured facility to a maximum of million if there are sufficient unencumbered assets to support the additional borrowings 
as discussed in more detail below under debt maturities  we may seek to increase the unencumbered asset pool related to the facility in order to increase our borrowing capacity 
the unsecured facility also includes a short term borrowing line of million with a variable interest rate 
borrowings under the short term line may not be outstanding for more than five days 
our ability to borrow under the unsecured facility is subject to ongoing compliance with various restrictive covenants  including with respect to liens  indebtedness  investments  dividends  mergers and asset sales 
in addition  the unsecured facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio of or up to in certain circumstances  adjusted ebitda as defined in the unsecured facility to fixed charges coverage ratio of at least to  minimum tangible net worth defined as total asset value less total indebtedness of million plus of the net proceeds of any future equity issuances  ratio of net operating income of unencumbered property to debt service under the unsecured facility of at least to  minimum unencumbered property pool occupancy rate of  ratio of variable rate indebtedness to total asset value of no more than to  and ratio of recourse indebtedness to total asset value of no more than to we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the unsecured facility as of december  under the terms of the unsecured facility  we are permitted to make distributions to our shareholders of up to of our funds from operations provided that no event of default exists 
if an event of default exists  we may only make distributions sufficient to maintain our reit status 
however  we may not make any distributions if an event of default resulting from nonpayment or bankruptcy exists  or if our obligations under the credit facility are accelerated 
term loan on august   we entered into an amendment to a million unsecured term loan the term loan amendment with keybank national association  as original lender and agent  raymond james bank and royal bank of canada that was originally entered into on july  the term loan amendment  among other things  increased the amount of borrowings under the original term loan agreement by an additional million  which amount was subsequently drawn  resulting in an aggregate amount outstanding under the term loan of million 
the operating partnership is the borrower under the term loan and we and several of the operating partnership s subsidiaries are guarantors of the operating partnership s obligations there under 
the majority of the proceeds of borrowings un der the term loan were used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in connection with the term loan  in september  we entered into a cash flow hedge for million at a fixed interest rate of 
the term loan has a scheduled maturity date of july  borrowings under the term loan will bear interest at a variable interest rate of libor plus basis points 
our ability to borrow under the term loan will be subject to ongoing compliance by us  the operating partnership and our subsidiaries with various restrictive covenants  including with respect to liens  indebtedness  investments  dividends  mergers and asset sales 
in addition  the term loan requires that we satisfy certain financial covenants that are substantially the same as those under the unsecured credit facility  as described above 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the term loan as of december  capital markets we have filed a registration statement  and subsequent prospectus supplements related thereto  with the securities and exchange commission allowing us to offer  from time to time  common shares or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million 
in october  we issued  common shares for offering proceeds  net of offering costs  of approximately million 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
short and long term liquidity needs overview we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
while we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a relatively stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  the current general economic downturn is adversely affecting the ability of some of our tenants to meet their lease obligations  as discussed in more detail above in overview on page these conditions  in turn  are having a negative impact on our business 
if the downturn in the financial markets and economy is prolonged  our cash flow from operations could be significantly affected 
short term liquidity needs the nature of our business  coupled with the requirements for qualifying for reit status which includes the stipulation that we distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income and to avoid paying tax on our income  necessitate that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis  which will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
our short term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt  expected dividend payments including distributions to persons who hold units in our operating partnership and recurring capital expenditures 
each quarter we discuss with our board of trustees the board our liquidity requirements along with other relevant fa ctors before the board decides whether and in what amount to declare a distribution 
in february  our board of trustees declared a quarterly cash distribution of per common share for the quarter ending march  this distribution represents a reduction from the amount paid in the prior quarter thereby allowing us to conserve additional liquidity 
we  along with our board  will continue to evaluate our distribution policy on a quarterly basis as we monitor the capital markets and the impact of the economy on our operations 
when we lease space to new tenants  or renew leases for existing tenants  we also incur expenditures for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
this amount  as well as the amount of recurring capital expenditures that we incur  will vary from year to year 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on operating properties and also incurred approximately million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
in addition  we currently anticipate incurring approximately million in additional tenant improvements and renovation costs within the next twelve months at our cedar hill plaza property to replace the former anchor tenant s space with the property s new anchor 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through borrowings under the unsecured facility  new construction loans  cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  accessing the public equity and debt markets to the extent that we are able 
debt maturities as of december   approximately million of our consolidated outstanding indebtedness was scheduled to mature in approximately million when including our share of unconsolidated debt  excluding scheduled monthly principal payments for our current plans with respect to each of these loans are as follows the construction loan on our beacon hill property million matures in march this loan has a five year extension option with a debt service coverage ratio of x 
we currently anticipate paying down the loan with land sale proceeds and or utilizing our unsecured revolving credit facility prior to original maturity  the variable rate mortgage loan on our fishers station property million matures in june we are currently in discussions with lenders on a three to five year loan and anticipate closing on the loan in the second quarter of  the construction loan on our cobblestone plaza property million matures in june we are currently in discussions with the lender to extend the maturity date of that loan and anticipate closing on the loan in the first quarter of  the variable rate land loan on our delray marketplace property million matures in july we are currently in discussions with the lender on an extension of the current loan or a new construction loan at the property  the fixed rate mortgage loan at our ridge plaza property million matures in october we currently plan to negotiate a three to five year loan in mid or utilize our unsecured revolving credit facility to pay it off prior to original maturity  while increasing total availability on the unsecured facility by increasing the unencumbered asset pool  the fixed rate mortgage loan at our boulevard crossing property million matures in december we currently plan to negotiate a three to five year loan in mid or utilize our unsecured revolving credit facility to pay it off prior to original maturity  while increasing total availability on the unsecured facility by increasing the unencumbered asset pool  and the variable rate land loan at our unconsolidated joint venture property parkside town commons million  our share of which is million matures in august we are currently in discussions with the lender for an month extension on the loan 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the development of new properties  redevelopment of existing properties  non recurring capital expenditures  acquisitions of properties  and payment of indebtedness at maturity 
redevelopment properties 
as of december   five of our properties shops at eagle creek  bolton plaza  rivers edge  courthouse shadows and four corner square were undergoing major redevelopment activities 
we anticipate our investment in these redevelopment projects will be a total of approximately million  which we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund through borrowings through our unsecured credit facility 
development properties 
as of december   we had three development projects in our current development pipeline 
the total estimated cost  including our share and our joint venture partners share  for these projects is approximately million  of which approximately million had been incurred as of december  our share of the total estimated cost of these projects is approximately million  of which we have incurred approximately million as of december  we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through existing construction loans  including the construction loan on eddy street commons that closed in december  with a total loan commitment of approximately million  of which no amounts were outstanding at december  in addition  if necessary  we may make draws on our unsecured credit facility 
see below for a more complete discussion of this development project 
the most significant project in our current development pipeline is eddy street commons at the university of notre dame located adjacent to the university in south bend  indiana  that is expected to include retail  office  hotels  a parking garage  apartments and residential units 
the eddy street commons project is discussed in detail below under contractual obligations obligations in connection with our development  redevelopment and visible shadow pipeline 
visible shadow development pipeline 
in addition to our current development pipeline  we have a visible shadow development pipeline which includes land parcels that are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financing 
as of december   this visible shadow pipeline consisted of six projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet of total leasable area 
we currently anticipate the total estimated cost of these six projects will be approximately million  of which our share is currently expected to be approximately million 
however  we are generally not contractually obligated to complete any developments in our visible shadow pipeline  as these projects consist of land parcels on which we have not yet commenced construction 
with respect t o each asset in the visible shadow pipeline  our policy is to not commence vertical construction until pre established leasing thresholds are achieved and the requisite third party financing is in place 
once these projects are transferred to the current development pipeline  we intend to fund our investment in these developments primarily through new construction loans and joint ventures  as well as borrowings on our unsecured facility  if necessary 
selective acquisitions  developments and joint ventures 
we may selectively pursue the acquisition and development of other properties  which would require additional capital 
it is unlikely we would have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long term capital requirements 
we would have to satisfy these needs through participation in joint venture arrangements  additional borrowings  sales of common or preferred shares and or cash generated through property dispositions 
we cannot be certain that we would have access to these sources of capital on satisfactory terms  if at all  to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors  including general capital market conditions  which is discussed in more detail above in overview 
we have entered into an agreement the venture with prudential real estate investors prei to pursue joint venture opportunities for the development and selected acquisition of community shopping centers in the united states 
the agreement allows for the venture to develop or acquire up to billion of well positioned community shopping centers in strategic markets in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  we have agreed to present to prei opportunities to develop or acquire community shopping centers  each with estimated project costs in excess of million 
we have the option to present to prei additional opportunities with estimated project costs under million 
the agreement allows for equity capital contributions of up to million to be made to the venture for qualifying projects 
we expect contributions would be made on a project by project basis with prei contributing and us contributing of the equity required 
our first project with prei is parkside town commons  which is currently in our visible shadow development pipeline 
cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to a change in accounts payable  accrued expenses  deferred revenue and other liabilities of million between years  which was primarily due to construction related expenses as well as the conservation of cash 
this increase was partially offset by a change in deferred costs and other assets of million between years 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of an increase of million in net proceeds from the sale of an operating property  which was the result of the net proceeds from the sale of silver glen crossings compared to the sale of th meridian 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in acquisitions of interests in properties and capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  a decrease of million from the net of loan proceeds  transaction costs and payments decreased million between years primarily due to the million draw from the new unsecured credit facility in compared to the million proceeds received under the term loan in  both of which were used to repay previously outstanding indebtedness 
this was partially offset by the million of offering proceeds  the majority of which was received in october when we completed an equity offering of  common shares at an offering price of per share 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase resulted largely from the addition of four operating properties purchased in  the opening of several properties that were under development during  and the change in tenant receivables and deferred costs and other assets between years of million 
these increases were partially offset by a change in accounts payable  accrued expenses  deferred revenues  and other liabilities between years of approximately million 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of a decrease of million in property acquisition and capital expenditures in compared to in addition  during  we realized net proceeds of million from the termination of our lease with marsh supermarkets at naperville marketplace and the related sale of this asset 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  a decrease of million from proceeds from loan transactions  net of loan transaction costs  decreased approximately million between periods 
this decrease was largely due to new debt obtained during for the purchase of four operating properties  an outside partners interest in a consolidated property  the financing of the acquisition of development land parcels  and the funding of development activity 
in  a significant portion of proceeds from loan transactions was related to the draw of million from the new unsecured credit facility to repay the principal amount outstanding under our then existing secured revolving credit facility and retire the secured revolving credit facility 
loan payments also decreased million between years  which was primarily the res ult of the repayment of short term borrowings related to the acquisition of properties in off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do  however  have certain obligations to some of the projects in our current development pipeline  including our obligations in connection with our eddy street commons development  as discussed below in contractual obligations  as well as our joint venture with prei with respect to our parkside town commons development  as discussed above 
as of december   we owned a interest in this joint venture which  under the terms of this joint venture  will be reduced to upon project specific construction financing 
as of december   our share of unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness was million 
unconsolidated joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the assets of the joint venture 
as of december   the operating partnership had guaranteed unconsolidated joint venture debt of million in the event the joint venture partnership defaults under the terms of the underlying arrangement  all of which was related to the parkside town commons development 
mortgages which are guaranteed by the operating partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture and that property could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation 
see note investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in our notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for information on our unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended december   and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties  excluding interest 
construction contracts tenant allowances operating leases consolidated long term debt pro rata share of joint venture debt employment contracts total thereafter unamortized debt premiums total in connection with the company s ipo and related formation transactions  we entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management 
under the agreements  each person received a stipulated annual salary through december  each agreement has an automatic one year renewal unless we or the employee elects not to renew the agreement 
the contracts were extended through december  the table above includes contracts executed as of december  in  we incurred million of interest expense  net of amounts capitalized of million 
although we cannot provide assurance of our ability to execute on our financing strategy  we intend to satisfy the approximately million of contractual obligations that are due in primarily by refinancing and or extending the maturity dates of maturing indebtedness  draws on our revolving credit facility  and obtaining new financing  as well as cash generated from operations 
see maturities on page for additional information with respect to our current plan to address our indebtedness maturing in fiscal year in connection with our formation at the time of our ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   then we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to their built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment 
the six properties to which our tax indemnity obligations relate represented approximately of our annualized base rent in the aggregate as of december  these six properties are international speedway square  shops at eagle creek  whitehall pike  ridge plaza shopping center  thirty south  and market street village 
construction contracts construction contracts in the table above represent commitments for contracts executed as of december  related to new developments  redevelopments and third party construction 
obligations in connection with our current development  redevelopment and visible shadow pipeline we are obligated under various contractual arrangements to complete the projects in our current development pipeline 
we currently anticipate our share of the cost of the three projects in our current development pipeline will be approximately million including million of costs associated with phase i of our eddy street commons development discussed below  of which approximately million of our share was unfunded as of december  we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through existing construction loans  including the construction loan on eddy street commons that closed in december  with a total loan commitment of approximately million  of which no amounts were outstanding at december  in addition  if necessary  we may make draws on our unsecured credit facility 
in addition to our current development pipeline  we also have a redevelopment pipeline and a visible shadow development pipeline  which includes land parcels that are undergoing pre development activity and are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financings 
generally  we are not contractually obligated to complete any projects in our redevelopment or visible shadow pipelines  as these consist of land parcels on which we have not yet commenced construction 
with respect to each asset in the visible shadow pipeline  our policy is to not commence vertical construction until appropriate pre leasing thresholds are met and the requisite third party financing is in place 
eddy street commons at the university of notre dame the most significant project in our current development pipeline is eddy street commons at the university of notre dame located adjacent to the university in south bend  indiana  that is expected to include retail  office  hotels  a parking garage  apartments and residential units 
a portion of the office space will be leased to the university of notre dame 
the city of south bend has contributed million to the development  funded by tax increment financing tif bonds issued by the city and a cash commitment from the city both of which are being used for the construction of a parking garage and infrastructure improvements in this project 
this development will be completed in several phases 
the initial phase of the project is currently under construction and will consist of the retail  office and apartment and residential units with an estimated total cost of million  of which our share is estimated to be million 
the ground beneath the initial phase of the development is leased from the university of notre dame over a year term at a fixed rate for first two years and based on a percentage of certain revenues thereafter 
the total estimated project costs for all phases of this development are currently estimated to be approximately million  our share of which is currently expected to be approximately million 
our exposure to this amount may be limited under certain circumstances 
we will own the retail and office components while the apartments will be owned by a third party 
portions of this initial phase are scheduled to open in late the hotel components of the project will be owned through a joint venture while the apartments and residential units are planned to be sold or operated through relationships with developers  owners and operators that specialize in residential real estate 
we do not expect to own either the residential or the apartment complex components of the project  although we have jointly guaranteed the apartment developer s construction loan 
at december   vertical construction had not yet commenced  therefore  the balance outstanding under the construction loan was not significant 
we expect to receive development  construction management  loan guaranty and other fees from various aspects of this project 
we have a contractual obligation in the form of a completion guarantee to the university of notre dame and to the city of south bend to complete all phases of the project  with the exception of certain of the residential units  consistent with commitments we typically make in connection with other bank funded development projects 
to the extent the hotel joint venture partner  the apartment developer owner or the residential developer owner fail to complete those aspects of the project  we will be required to complete the construction  at which time we expect that we would seek title to the assets and assume any construction borrowings related to the assets 
we will have certain remedies against the developers if they were to fail to complete the construction 
if we fail to fulfill our contractual obligations in connection with the project  but are using our best efforts  we may be held liable but we have limited our liability to both the university of notre dame and the city of south bend

funds from operations funds from operations ffo  is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which we refer to as the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciated property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definitions differently than we do 
our calculation of ffo and reconciliation to net income is as follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  funds from operations net income add loss gain on sale of consolidated operating property less gain on sale of unconsolidated property add loss on sale of asset  net of tax add limited partners interests in income add depreciation and amortization of consolidated entities and discontinued operations  net of minority interest add joint venture partners interests in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities funds from operations of the kite portfolio less limited partners interests in funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company funds from operations of the kite portfolio measures of the operating performance of the operating partnership s real estate properties and construction and service subsidiaries in which the company owns an interest 
funds from operations allocable to the company reflects a reduction for the limited partners weighted average diluted interest in the operating partnership 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates of debt instruments of similar maturities and terms 
market risk related to fixed rate debt we had approximately million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of december  inclusive of net premiums on acquired debt of million 
as of december   we were party to eight consolidated interest rate hedge agreements for a total of million  with interest rates ranging from to and maturities over various terms through including the effects of these hedge agreements  our fixed and variable rate debt would have been approximately million and million  respectively  of our total consolidated indebtedness at december  reflecting our share of unconsolidated debt and the effect of related hedge agreements  our fixed and variable rate debt is also and  respectively  of total consolidated and our share of unconsolidated indebtedness at december  based on the amount of our fixed rate debt at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in its fair value of approximately million 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  would increase or decrease our annual cash flow by approximately million 
as a matter of policy  we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative transactions 
inflation most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance 
this helps reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
