our return on average assets for was compared to for our year end results were heavily impacted by the continuing financial crisis and on going national economic recession 
weaknesses in residential development and rising unemployment levels in our market areas also impacted earnings which had a significant impact on our net charge off levels and resulted in a higher allowance for loan losses in as a result of these difficult national and regional issues  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million  which represents an increase of million compared to of the million provision  million was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the ongoing recession  the continued rise in unemployment levels  and an increase in non performing loans and higher past dues 
net charge offs for were million  or of average loans and were up million compared to of the million in net charge offs in  million of that was recorded in the fourth quarter of and was primarily related to the construction and land development segments as the housing market continued to struggle 
the construction and land development loan segment represents approximately of hancock s total loan portfolio  or about million at year end these weakening economic conditions also impacted our allowance for loan losses  which increased to of period end loans at december  from the recorded at december  our balance sheet showed strong growth during at year end  our total asset level reached billion  an increase of billion  or  from december  we experienced strong growth in loans in period end loans were up million  or  from december  loan growth increased across our loan categories of commercial real estate  direct consumer  indirect consumer  and finance company loans 
all of the growth in assets was organic growth as we did not record any acquisitions in the past year 
we also experienced strong growth in deposits over the past year 
period end deposits at december  were billion  up million  or  from december  our growth was related to deposit rate campaigns in growing markets in addition to customers seeking a safe and secure bank for their money as some other banks experienced capital concerns in we continue to remain well capitalized with total equity of million at december   up million  or  from december  results of operations net interest income net interest income te is the primary component of our earnings and represents the difference  or spread  between revenue generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense related to funding those assets 
for internal analytical purposes  management adjusts net interest income to a taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate on tax exempt items primarily interest on municipal securities and loans 
fluctuations in interest rates  as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income te 
another significant statistic in the analysis of net interest income is the effective interest differential also referred to as the net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income te to our average earning assets 
the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the effective rate paid for all deposits and borrowed funds  non interest bearing as well as interest bearing is the net interest spread 
since a portion of the bank s deposits does not bear interest  such as demand accounts  the rate paid for all funds is lower than the rate on interest bearing liabilities alone 
the net interest margin te for the years   and was   and  respectively 
net interest income te of million was recorded for the year  an increase of million  or  from we experienced a decrease of million  or  from to the factors contributing to the changes in net interest income te for  and are presented in tables and table is an analysis of the components of average balance sheets  levels of interest income and expense and the resulting earning asset yields and liability rates 
table details the overall changes in the level of net interest income into rate and volume 
the increase of million in net interest income te in from was caused by an increase in average earnings assets of million  or 
in  our average loan growth increased million  or  from along with a slight increase in average securities of million 
with short term interest rates down significantly from last year  our loan yield fell basis points  pushing the yield on average earnings assets down basis points 
there was also an unfavorable change in in our average funding mix with most new deposits more heavily weighted to mostly time deposits of million and lower levels of non interest bearing transaction deposits of million 
when comparing to  the primary driver of the million  or decrease  in net interest income te was a million  or  decrease in average earning assets 
in  our average loan growth increased million offset by a decrease in average securities of million 
there was an unfavorable change in in our average funding mix with higher levels of more costly time deposits of million and lower levels of transaction deposits of million 
the impact of this change on net interest margin was managed by reducing rates paid on the interest bearing deposits 
recognizing the importance of interest differential to total earnings  management places great emphasis on managing interest rate spreads 
although interest differential is affected by national  regional  and area economics our loan and investment policies are designed to maximize interest differential while maintain sufficient liquidity and availability of funds for purposes of meeting existing commitments and for investment in loans and other investment opportunities that may arise

the provision for loan losses reflects management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio

the loans contributing to the increase have been identified  and appropriate write downs or allowances have been made based on underlying collateral values and those relationships have been placed in the hands of special asset personnel for handling 
management believes that the loans included in the non performing assets total are being handled appropriately 
allowance for loan and lease losses management and the audit committee are responsible for maintaining an effective loan review system  and internal controls  which include an effective risk rating system that identifies  monitors  and addresses asset quality problems in an accurate and timely manner 
the allowance is evaluated for adequacy on at least a quarterly basis 
the company s loan loss reserve methodology is established and maintained at an amount sufficient to cover the estimated credit loss associated with the loan and lease portfolios of the bank as of the date of determination 
credit losses arise not only from credit risk  but also from other risks inherent in the lending process including  but not limited to  collateral risk  operational risk  concentration risk  and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses alll 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses involves significant judgment 
therefore  the company has established a methodology for measuring the adequacy of the alll  which is systematic and consistently applied each quarter 
the analysis and methodology include three primary segments a specific reserve analysis for those loans considered impaired under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 a pool analysis of groups of loans within the portfolio that have similar characteristics  and qualitative risk factors and general economic conditions 
a sfas no 
reserve analysis is completed on all loans that have been determined to be impaired by management 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of that impairment must be measured by either the loan s observable market price  the fair value of the collateral of the loan  less liquidation costs  if it is collateral dependent  or by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the value of the impaired loan is less than the current balance of the loan  the company must recognize the impairment by creating a specific reserve allowance for the shortfall 
the second reserve segment  the pool analysis methodology is governed by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
a historical loss rate is calculated for each loan type over the prior quarters to determine the year average loss rate 
as circumstances dictate  management will make adjustments to the loss history to reflect significant changes in the company s loss history 
the third segment relates to risks not captured elsewhere 
adjustments are made to historical loss rates to cover risks associated with trends in delinquencies  non accruals  current economic conditions  credit administration underwriting practices  and borrower concentrations 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or  of year end loans  compared to million  or  of year end loans for net charge offs increased significantly to million in  as compared to million in overall  the allowance for loan losses was of non performing loans and accruing loans days past due at year end compared to at year end we utilize quantitative methodologies and modeling to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and are of the opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate

the unallocated portion of the allowance represents supportable estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not specifically related to one category of the portfolio 
the allocation is not necessarily indicative of the category of incurred losses  and the full allowance at december  is available to absorb losses occurring in category of loans

such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract amounts of these instruments reflect our exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party on whose behalf the instrument has been issued 
we undertake the same credit evaluation in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support for off balance sheet financial instruments 
at december   we had million in unused loan commitments outstanding  of which approximately million were at variable rates and the remainder was at fixed rates 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the agreement have been satisfied 
a commitment to extend credit generally has a fixed expiration date or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower 
since commitments often expire without being fully drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements 
we continually evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
occasionally  a credit evaluation of a customer requesting a commitment to extend credit results in our obtaining collateral to support the obligation 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing a letter of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending a loan 
at december   we had million in letters of credit issued and outstanding 
the following table shows the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at december  and according to expiration date

the remaining of the class b shares are restricted and must be held for the longer period of years or until all settlements are complete 
at that time  we can keep the class b shares or convert them to class a publicly tradeable shares at a conversion rate to be determined 
these shares are recorded at historical cost 
the realized securities gain is included in the securities gain line of the noninterest income section of the consolidated statements of income and the cash received is recorded in cash and due from banks in the assets section of the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  visa lowered its estimate of pending litigation settlements 
consequently  million of the million fin no

there was no cash outlay required of us 
based on the funding and settlement with discover  we reversed as of december   the portion of the visa contingency reserve related to discover of million 
the reduction in the litigation liability is recorded in the other liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets and the reduction in litigation expense is recorded in the other expense line of the noninterest expense section of the consolidated statements of income 
the settlement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
as of december   million of the initial million fin no

risk management credit risk the banks primary lending focus is to provide commercial  consumer and real estate loans to consumers and to small and middle market businesses in their respective market areas 
diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of reducing the risks associated with economic fluctuations 
the banks have no significant concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or loans to any foreign entities 
there have been increases in some categories of loans home equity  real estate construction term and c i loans are examples 
these are principally within and in support of the markets that are continuing to rebuild and repair since hurricane katrina 
loan demand continues to be strong within those markets 
loan underwriting standards reduce the impact of credit risk to us 
loans are underwritten on the basis of repayment ability and collateral value 
generally  real estate mortgage loans are made when the borrower produces evidence of repayment ability along with equity in the property to offset historical market devaluations 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses alll is a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans 
the alll is established and maintained at an amount sufficient to cover the estimated credit loss associated with the loan and lease portfolios as of the date of the determination 
credit losses arise not only from credit risk  but also from other risks inherent in the lending process including  but not limited to  collateral risk  operational risk  concentration risk  and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
quarterly  we estimate the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably foreseeable  anticipated losses in the existing portfolio based on our past loan loss and delinquency experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
the analysis and methodology include three primary segments 
these segments include a pool analysis of various retail loans based upon loss history  a pool analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans based upon loss history by loan type  and a specific reserve analysis for those loans considered impaired under sfas no 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of  or greater are individually reviewed for impairment  substandard mortgage loans with balances of  or greater are also included in the analysis 
all losses are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a loss is likely to occur  recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses at the time of receipt 
commercial loans are considered impaired when it is probable the future event or events are likely to occur that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due including principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in order to ensure consideration of all possible impairments  for purposes of the model the banks consider all loans that are risk rated substandard as impaired 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of that impairment must be measured by either the loan s observable market price  the fair value of the collateral of the loan less liquidation costs if it is collateral dependent  or by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the value of the impaired loan is less than the current balance of the loan  the impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve allowance for the shortfall 
if the value is greater or equal to the loan balance  then no reserve allocation may be made for the loan 
in addition  any loans included in the impairment review are not incorporated into the pool analysis to avoid double counting 
pool analysis is applied for all retail loans 
the retail loans are subdivided into three groups  which currently include mortgage real estate  indirect loans and direct consumer loans 
a historical loss rate is calculated for each group over the twelve prior quarters to determine the three year average loss rate 
as circumstances dictate  management will make adjustments to the loss history to reflect significant changes in our loss history 
adjustments will also be made to historical loss rates to cover risks associated with trends in delinquencies  non accruals  current economic conditions and credit administration underwriting practices and policies 
a historical loss ratio is applied to all commercial loans  commercial real estate loans and leases grouped by product type for which sfas no 
exposure can best be evaluated collectively due to similar attributes 
a historical loss rate is calculated for each group over the twelve prior quarters to determine the three year average loss rate 
as circumstances dictate  we will make adjustments to the loss history to reflect significant changes in our loss history 
adjustments will also be made to historical loss rates to cover risks associated with trends in delinquencies  non accruals  current economic conditions and credit administration underwriting practices and policies and borrower concentrations 
asset liability management our asset liability management alm process consists of quantifying  analyzing and controlling interest rate risk irr to maintain stability in net interest income nii under varying interest rate environments 
the principal objective of alm is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of liquidity 
our net earnings are dependent on our net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to irr to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis and timing than interest earning assets 
this timing difference represents a potential risk to our future earnings 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest and the subsequent impact on customer behavior could adversely affect nii 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates and changes in customer behavior could result in a decrease in nii 
management and the asset liability committee alco direct our irr management through a risk management policy that is designed to produce a stable net interest margin nim in periods of interest rate fluctuation 
in adjusting our asset liability position  the board of directors and management attempt to direct our irr while enhancing the nim 
at times  depending on the general level of interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine strategies that could add to the level of irr in order to increase its nim 
not withstanding our irr management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net earnings 
to control interest rate risk  we regularly monitor the volume of interest sensitive assets compared with interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to maturity or repricing within a given time period 
we also administer this sensitivity through the development and implementation of investment  lending  funding and pricing strategies designed to achieve nii performance goals while minimizing the potential negative variations in nii under different interest rate scenarios 
investment strategies  including portfolio durations and cash flows  are formulated and continually adjusted during the implementation to assure attainment of objectives in the most effective manner 
loan and deposit pricing are adjusted weekly to reflect current interest rate and competitive market environments  with duration targets on both reviewed monthly 
the static gap report shown in table measures the net amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice within a given time period over the remaining lives of those instruments 
at december   our cumulative repricing gap in the one year interval was 
the asset sensitive position represents a significant security portfolio cash flow within one year 
the earning asset position is strategically managed with a balance in our loan growth fixed versus floating and duration targets and securities portfolio cash flows 
we believe we are well positioned for the current rate environment 
to further control irr  we structure our loan portfolio to provide appropriate investment opportunities while minimizing potential volatility in earnings from extension risk 
deposit strategies continue to emphasize a mix of non certificate of deposit core accounts and consumer time deposits 
however  the yield curve environment has created more demand on consumer time deposits with maturities less than one year 
the following table sets forth the scheduled re pricing or maturity of our assets and liabilities at december  and december  the assumed prepayment of investments and loans was based on our assessment of current market conditions on such dates 
estimates have been made for the re pricing of savings  now and money market accounts 
actual prepayments and deposit withdrawals will differ from the following analysis due to variable economic circumstances and consumer behavior 
although assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods  reactions will vary as to timing and degree of interest rate change

table presents an analysis of our irr as measured by the estimated changes in nii resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in the yield curve at december  shifts are measured in basis point increments through basis points from base case 
base case encompasses key assumptions for asset liability mix  loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds  deposit decay rates  securities portfolio cash flows and reinvestment strategy  and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
the base case scenario assumes that the current interest rate environment is held constant throughout the forecast period  the instantaneous shocks are performed against that yield curve 
table net interest income te at risk change in interest rates estimated increase decrease in nii december  basis points stable most likely additionally  we have forecasted a most likely nii scenario based on its conservative projection of yield curve changes for the coming month period 
this scenario utilizes all base case assumptions  applying those assumptions against a yield curve forecast that incorporates the current interest rate environment and projects certain strategic pricing changes over the forecast period 
table indicates that our level of nii significantly increases under rising rates and declines under falling rates 
it should be noted that is only presented as interest rates are at historic lows with fed funds target at at december  the most likely scenario for interest rates projects a modest increase in net interest income to base case indicating that the balance sheet is appropriately structured for the current rate environment 
the increasing rate scenarios show significant increase to levels of net interest income while the down scenario shows lower levels of nii 
these scenarios are instantaneous shocks that assume balance sheet management will mirror base case 
should the yield curve begin to rise or fall  management has several strategies available to maximize earnings opportunities or offset the negative impact to earnings 
for example  in a rising rate environment  deposit pricing strategies could be adjusted to offer more competitive rates on long and medium term cds and less competitive rates on short term cds 
another opportunity at the start of such a cycle would be reinvesting the securities portfolio cash flows into short term or floating rate securities 
on the loan side the company can make more floating rate loans that tie to index that re price more frequently  such as libor london interbank offered rate and make fewer fixed rate loans 
finally  there are a number of hedge strategies by which management could use derivatives  including swaps and purchased ceilings  to lock in net interest margin protection  to date  we have not entered into any hedge transactions for the purpose of earnings protection 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as anticipated 
additionally  a change in the us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the us treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to nii than indicated above 
strategic management of our balance sheet and earnings is fluid and would be adjusted to accommodate these movements 
as with any method of measuring irr  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
also  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
liquidity liquidity management liquidity management encompasses our ability to ensure that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while also ensuring that we have adequate cash flow to meet our various needs  including operating  strategic and capital 
without proper liquidity management  we would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would not be able to meet the needs of the communities in which we have a presence and serve 
in addition  the parent holding company s principal source of liquidity is dividends from its subsidiary banks 
liquidity is required at the parent holding company level for the purpose of paying dividends to stockholders  servicing of any debt we may have  business combinations as well as general corporate expenses 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and occasional sales of various assets 
short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
as shown in table below  our liquidity ratios as of december  and for free securities stood at or million and or million  respectively

purchases of federal funds  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and represent our incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
our short term borrowing capacity includes an approved line of credit with the federal home loan bank of million and borrowing capacity at the federal reserve s discount window in excess of million 
as of december  and  our core deposits were billion and billion  respectively  and net wholesale funding stood at billion and billion  respectively 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide an analysis of cash from operating  investing  and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december  cash flows from operations are a significant part of liquidity management  contributing significant levels of funds in  and cash flows from operations increased to million in from million in net cash used by investing activities increased to billion in from million in federal funds sold increased million during and decreased million during cash flows provided by financing activities were billion in  primarily from the increase in deposits compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in contractual obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments on certain debt and lease agreements

composite ratings by the respective regulatory authorities of the company and the banks establish minimum capital levels 
currently  we are required to maintain minimum tier leverage ratios of at least  subject to an increase up to  depending on the composite rating 
at december   our capital balances were in excess of current regulatory minimum requirements

critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting principles we follow and the methods for applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices followed by the banking industry which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments 
we evaluate estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
illiquid credit markets  volatile equity markets  rising unemployment levels and declines in consumer spending have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses our most critical accounting policy relates to our allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our borrowers to make loan payments 
if the financial condition of its borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the estimates of the allowance would be updated  and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
the allowance for loan and lease losses alll is a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans 
the alll is established and maintained at an amount sufficient to cover the estimated credit loss associated with the loan and lease portfolios of the banks as of the date of the determination 
credit losses arise not only from credit risk  but also from other risks inherent in the lending process including  but not limited to  collateral risk  operational risk  concentration risk  and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
quarterly  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably foreseeable  anticipated losses in the existing portfolio based on our past loan loss and delinquency experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
the analysis and methodology include three primary segments 
these segments include a pool analysis of various retail loans based upon loss history  a pool analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans based upon loss history by loan type  and a specific reserve analysis for those loans considered impaired under sfas no 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of  or greater are individually reviewed for impairment  substandard mortgage loans with balances of  or greater are also included in the analysis 
all losses are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a loss is likely to occur  recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses at the time of receipt 
retirement employee benefit plans retirement and employee benefit plan assets  liabilities and pension costs are determined utilizing actuarially determined present value calculations 
the valuation of the benefit obligation and net periodic expense is considered critical  as it requires management and its actuaries to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected cash outflows including assumptions about mortality  expected service periods  rate of compensation increases and the long term return on plan assets 
note retirement and employee benefit plans  included in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  provides further discussion on the accounting for hancock s retirement and employee benefit plans and the estimates used in determining the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit expense 
fair value accounting estimates generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities  as well as for specific disclosures 
the most significant include securities  loans held for sale  mortgage servicing rights and net assets acquired in business combinations 
certain of these assets do not have a readily available market to determine fair value and require an estimate based on specific parameters 
when market prices are unavailable  we determine fair values utilizing parameters  which are constantly changing  including interest rates  duration  prepayment speeds and other specific conditions 
in most cases  these specific parameters require a significant amount of judgment by management 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 on january  sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework  and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to these valuation techniques used to measure fair value giving preference to quoted prices in active markets level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs such as a reporting entity s own data level 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  observable inputs other than quoted prices  such as interest rates and yield curves  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
available for sale securities classified as level within the valuation hierarchy include us treasury securities  obligations of us government sponsored agencies  and other debt and equity securities 
level classified available for sale securities include mortgage backed debt securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  and state and municipal bonds 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active  which clarifies the application of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements  in an inactive market 
application issues clarified include how management s internal assumptions should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant observable data do not exist  how observable market information in a market that is not active should be considered when measuring fair value  and how the use of market quotes should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data available to measure fair value 
fsp was effective immediately and did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment sfas no 
sfas no 
 on january  the company did not elect to fair value any additional items under sfas no 
the company  in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position no 
the effective date of fasb statement no 
 will defer application of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january  income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
determination of the deferred and current provision requires analysis by management of certain transactions and the related tax laws and regulations 
management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
those judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change
