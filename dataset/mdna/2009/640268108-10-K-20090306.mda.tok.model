item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as factors described in part i  item a risk factors 
overview strategic direction of our business we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our pegylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms to improve the therapeutic benefits of drugs 
our proprietary product pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas  including oncology  pain  anti infectives and immunology 
we create our innovative product candidates by using our proprietary chemistry platform to modify the chemical structure of drugs using unique polymer conjugates 
additionally  we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and the attributes of our customized polymer chemistry 
our drug candidates are designed to correct deficiencies in the pharmacokinetics  half life  oral bioavailability  metabolism or distribution of drugs to improve their therapeutic efficacy 
during  we expect to continue to make substantial investments to advance our pipeline of drug candidates from early stage discovery research through clinical development 
on march   we announced that we were terminating our phase clinical trial for oral nktr oral pegylated naloxol as a result of positive preliminary results 
we also have several phase clinical trials for nktr pegylated irinotecan directed at a number of different indications in the oncology therapeutic area already underway or scheduled to begin during in addition  on february   we announced that we had dosed the first patient in a phase clinical trial for nktr pegylated docetaxel for patients with refractory solid tumors 
we also have several other products in the early discovery or preclinical stage that we are preparing to move into clinical development or will be moving into clinical development in our focus on research and clinical development requires substantial investments that continue to increase as we advance each drug candidate through the development cycle 
while we believe that our strategy has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results and or receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets  drug development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and clinical results are very difficult to predict 
clinical development success and failures can have an unpredictable and disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects  financial prospects  financial condition  and market value 
we intend to decide on a product by product basis whether we wish to continue development into phase pivotal clinical trials and commercialize products on our own  or seek a partner  or pursue a combination of these approaches 
following completion of phase development  or earlier in the development cycle in certain circumstances  we will generally be seeking collaborations with one or more biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to conduct phase clinical development  to be responsible for the regulatory approval process and  if such drug candidate is approved  to market and sell the drug in one or more world markets 
the commercial terms of such future collaborations  if any  including  without limitation  up front payments  development milestone payments  and royalty rates  will be critical to the future prospects of our business and financial condition 
in particular  our ability to successfully conclude a new collaboration for oral nktr on commercially favorable terms or at all  will have a significant impact on our financial position and business prospects in we also have a number of existing license and collaboration agreements with third parties who have licensed our proprietary technologies for drugs that have either received regulatory approval in one or more markets or drug candidates that are still in the clinical development stage 
for example  the future clinical and commercial success of bayer s amikacin inhale bay or nktr  ucb s cimzia  roche s mircera and affymax s hematide  among others  will together have a material impact on our long term revenue prospects  as will the success of bayer s cipro inhale program  in relation to which we have certain royalty rights 
because drug development and commercialization is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  there is a risk that our future revenue from one or more of these agreements will be less than we anticipate 

table of contents we exited the inhaled insulin drug programs in in  we entered into a collaborative development and licensing agreement with pfizer to develop and market dry powder inhaled insulin exubera for patients with diabetes 
in and  we entered into a series of interim letter agreements with pfizer to develop a next generation form of dry powder inhaled insulin ngi 
in january  exubera received marketing approval in the us and eu 
under the collaborative development and licensing agreement  pfizer had sole responsibility for marketing and selling exubera 
we performed all of the manufacturing of the bulk dry powder insulin  and through our third party contract manufacturers bespak europe ltd 
and tech group north america  inc  we supplied pfizer with the exubera inhalers 
our total revenue from pfizer was nil  million  and million  representing   and of total revenue  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
on october   pfizer announced that it was exiting the exubera and inhaled insulin development and gave notice of termination under our collaborative development and licensing agreement 
on november   we entered into a termination agreement and mutual release with pfizer 
under this agreement we received a one time payment of million from pfizer in november in satisfaction of all outstanding contractual obligations under our then existing agreements relating to exubera and ngi 
all agreements between pfizer and us related to exubera and ngi  other than the termination agreement and mutual release and a related interim exubera manufacturing maintenance letter  terminated on november  in february  we entered into a manufacturing termination agreement with bespak and tech group pursuant to which we paid an aggregate of million in satisfaction of outstanding accounts payable and termination costs and expenses that were due to the contract manufacturers under the exubera inhaler contract manufacturing agreement 
we also entered into a maintenance agreement with both pfizer and tech group to preserve key personnel and manufacturing capacity to support potential future exubera manufacturing if we were successful in finding a new partner for the inhaled insulin program 
on april   we announced that we had ceased all negotiations with potential partners for exubera and ngi as a result of new data analysis from ongoing clinical trials conducted by pfizer which indicated an increase in the number of new cases of lung cancer in exubera patients who were former smokers as compared to patients in the control group who were not former smokers 
in april  we ceased all spending associated with maintaining exubera manufacturing capacity and any further ngi development  including  but not limited to  terminating the exubera manufacturing capacity maintenance arrangements with pfizer and tech group 
we completed the sale of certain pulmonary assets and operations at the end of on december   we completed the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business  associated technology and intellectual property to novartis pharma ag and novartis pharmaceuticals corporation together referred to as novartis for a purchase price of million in cash novartis pulmonary asset sale 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement entered between novartis and us  we transferred to novartis assets and obligations which include certain dry powder and liquid pulmonary formulation and manufacturing assets  including capital equipment and manufacturing facility lease obligations  certain intellectual property and manufacturing methods and associated information systems related to the pulmonary business  and certain other interests in two private companies  and novartis hired approximately of our pulmonary personnel 
in addition  we assigned our rights and obligations  other than certain royalty rights  related to the cipro inhale partnered with bayer schering pharma ag to novartis  and terminated our collaborative research  development  and commercialization agreement related to the tobramycin inhalation powder tip program with novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we retain our rights and obligations under our co development  license and co promotion agreement with bayer healthcare llc related to bay nktr  amikacin inhale  our development program related to nktr inhaled vancomycin and intellectual property specific to inhaled insulin 
although we completed the novartis pulmonary asset sale on december   we will pay approximately million in related transaction costs in the three months ended march   including legal fees  investment banker fees  and other costs 
following the completion of the novartis transaction  we expect our contract research revenue and total revenue to significantly decline in due to the termination of the inhaled tip collaboration agreement with novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc and our assignment and transfer of our inhaled cipro inhale collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag to novartis 
our collaboration revenue related to tip and cipro inhale was million and million  or and  respectively  of our total revenue for the year ended december  we will not receive any revenue from these programs in however  also following the novartis transaction  we will no longer incur expenses from the approximately pulmonary personnel and the dedicated pulmonary manufacturing facility  as well as certain other costs related to the assets and obligations  transferred to novartis 
the only future research and development obligations associated with the pulmonary assets that we retained in relation to the novartis transaction relate to bay and nktr under our collaboration agreement with bayer healthcare llc  we are responsible for the completion of final device development and have a reimbursement obligation for up to million of phase development costs incurred by bayer healthcare llc 

table of contents key developments and trends in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in indebtedness 
in the three months ended december   we repurchased approximately million in par value of our convertible subordinated notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we may from time to time purchase or retire additional convertible subordinated notes through cash purchase or exchanges for other securities of the company in open market or privately negotiated transactions  depending on  among other factors  our levels of available cash and the price at which such convertible notes are available for purchase 
we will evaluate such transactions  if any  in light of then existing market conditions 
these transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material to our business 
we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales and royalties and research and development contracts and public and private placements of debt and equity 
to date we have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes that are convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities  and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for our financial condition and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
our ability to meet our ongoing operating expenses and repay our outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon our and our partners ability to successfully complete clinical development of  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize new drugs 
even if we or our partners are successful  we may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations as they become due 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
for the year ended december   net cash used for our operating activities was million 
during the year ended december   we made the following payments  among others i million to bespak europe ltd 
and tech group as payment for termination amounts due under our exubera inhaler manufacturing and supply agreement with those companies  all of which was recorded as an expense in  ii million to maintain exubera manufacturing capacity through april and iii million for severance  employee benefits and outplacement services in connection with our workforce reduction plans 
we do not anticipate incurring any costs in associated with inhaled insulin 
our substantial investment in our preclinical and clinical research and any potential new licensing or partnership agreements  if any  will be the key drivers of our results of operations and financial position during one of our collaboration partners has a one time license extension option exercisable in december if this partner elects to exercise this license extension option right  we will receive a cash payment of million in december results of operations years ended december    and revenue in thousands except percentages percentage percentage increase increase increase increase years ended december  decrease decrease decrease decrease vs

product sales and royalties collaboration and other total revenue during the year ended december   the decrease in total revenue from the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the termination of our collaboration agreements with pfizer related to exubera and ngi  which accounted for million  or  of our total revenue during the year ended december  we had no revenue from pfizer related to exubera or ngi for the year ended december  four of our customers  bayer including bayer healthcare llc and bayer schering pharma ag  ucb pharma  novartis  and roche represented    and  respectively  of our total revenue during the year ended december  in connection with the completion of the novartis pulmonary asset sale on december   our collaboration agreement with novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc for tip was terminated and our collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag for cipro inhale was assigned to novartis 
collaboration revenue related to tip and cipro inhale was million and million  or and  of our total revenue for the year ended december  we will not receive any revenue related to these programs in while we may enter new collaboration or license agreements in  we expect revenue to decrease in as a result of the tip agreement termination  the assignment of the cipro inhale agreement  and lower product sales volumes required by our licensing partners 
in addition  if our collaboration partner elects not to exercise its one time license extension option in december and pay us the one time million license fee for such option  our revenue would significantly decrease in as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents product sales and royalties for the year ended december   exubera product sales to pfizer accounted for million of our total revenue 
we had no revenue from pfizer related to exubera for the year ended december  non exubera product sales and royalties decreased by approximately million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in non exubera product sales and royalties is primarily attributable to the november  sale of aerogen ireland ltd  one of our former subsidiaries that manufactured and supplied general purpose nebulizer devices  which accounted for million in revenue for the year ended december  product sales and royalties increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  exubera product sales to pfizer increased by approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  exubera commercial sales began in january during the year ended december   we deferred recognition of all exubera product sales until pfizer s contractual day right of return period lapsed 
as a result  as of december   we deferred million in exubera product sales and we recognized ten months of product shipments in revenue 
in january  we began estimating product warranty returns and recognizing exubera product sales upon shipment 
during the year ended december   we recognized product sales through november   when our collaboration agreements with pfizer terminated  as well as the revenue deferred at december  royalty revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
collaboration and other revenue collaboration and other revenue includes reimbursed research and development expenses  amortization of deferred up front signing and milestone payments received from our collaboration partners  and intellectual property license fee revenue 
collaboration revenue fluctuates from year to year  and therefore future collaboration revenue cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of collaboration and other revenues depends in part upon the continuation of existing collaborations  signing of new collaborations  the stage of program development  and the achievement of milestones 
for the year ended december   collaboration and other revenue from pfizer related to exubera and ngi accounted for million of our collaboration and other revenue 
we had no collaboration and other revenue from pfizer related to exubera or ngi for the year ended december  the increase in non pfizer collaboration and other revenue of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a new intellectual property license agreement we entered into with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
for the year ended december   we have recognized increased collaboration and other revenue from bayer including bayer healthcare llc and bayer schering pharma ag of million under our collaboration agreements for bay nktr  amikacin inhale and cipro inhale 
these increases are offset by decreased collaboration and other revenue of million from novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc under our collaboration agreement for tip and of million from solvay pharmaceuticals  inc and zelos therapeutics inc following the termination of those collaboration agreements in the increase in collaboration and other revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to increased revenue from pfizer of million  which includes recognition of million in ngi up front fees upon termination of the pfizer agreements 
additionally  collaboration and other revenue from novartis increased by million under our collaboration agreement for tip  and bayer including bayer healthcare llc and bayer schering pharma ag increased by million  and million  respectively  under our collaboration agreements for cipro inhale and bay  respectively 
these increases in collaboration and other revenue were partially offset by decreased revenue from zelos of million under our collaboration agreement to develop ostabolin c

cost of goods sold product gross margin product gross margin the decrease in cost of goods sold and product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the termination of our agreements with pfizer related to exubera 
during the year ended december   exubera cost of goods sold totaled million and exubera gross margin totaled million 
the increase in product gross margin percentage is attributable to the change in product mix with our product sales based on our pegylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies which have a relatively higher gross margin 
cost of goods sold during the year ended december  includes exubera manufacturing costs through the november  termination of the pfizer agreements 
costs related to our exubera manufacturing operations after november  are included in other cost of revenue 
the increase in cost of goods sold and product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is consistent with the proportionate increase in exubera product sales  which contributed million to our product gross margin during the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin percentage during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to product mix  the terms of our cost plus manufacturing arrangement with pfizer  and the decline in royalty revenue of million during we expect cost of goods sold and product gross margin to decline in as compared to the year ended december  in connection with the lower manufacturing requirements forecasted by our licensing partners
