except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described in item a 
risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  breatheway packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications in june and for personal care applications in november  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of landec has three core businesses food products technology  commodity trading and technology licensing 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the commodity trading business is operated through apio and combines apio s cal ex export company with apio s domestic buy sell commodity business that purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to asia and domestically to wal mart 
the technology licensing business includes our proprietary intellicoat seed coating technology which we have licensed to monsanto and our intelimer polymer business that licenses and or supplies products outside of our food products technology business to companies such as air products and nitta 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s retained earnings were million 
the company may incur losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates that require management s most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  the valuation of intangible assets and inventory  the valuation and nature of impairments of investments  and the valuation and recognition of stock based compensation 
these estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments 
the analysis of historical and future trends  can require extended periods of time to resolve  and are subject to change from period to period 
the actual results may differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially low risk national and regional retailers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory currently considered to be unusable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses 
the company takes title to all produce it trades and or packages  and therefore  records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the consolidated statements of income in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab  sab 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement  including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangibles the company s intangible assets are comprised primarily of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives collectively  intangible assets  which the company recognized in accordance with the guidelines in sfas no 
 business combinations sfas i upon the acquisition  in december  of all the assets of apio  which consists of the food products technology and commodity trading reporting units and ii from the repurchase of all minority interests in the common stock of landec ag  a subsidiary of the company  in december sfas defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition 
all intangible assets  including goodwill  associated with the apio acquisition were allocated to the food products technology reporting unit pursuant to sfas based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for the food products technology reporting unit 
the consideration paid for the commodity trading reporting unit approximated its fair market value at the time of acquisition  and therefore no intangible assets were recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of this reporting unit 
goodwill associated with the technology licensing reporting unit consists entirely of goodwill resulting from the repurchase of the landec ag minority interests 
the company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
when evaluating indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  sfas requires the company to first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired  thus application of the second step of the two step approach in sfas is not required 
application of the intangible assets impairment tests requires significant judgment by management  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of intangible assets to reporting units  and the determination of the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset and reporting unit based upon projections of future net cash flows  discount rates and market multiples  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
the company tested its intangible assets for impairment as of july  and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of the intangible assets were necessary as of that date 
on a quarterly basis  the company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its intangible assets  based on management s assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation 
such changes  if significant or material  could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the intangible assets during the current period 
the results of these tests could lead to write downs of the carrying values of the intangible assets in the current period 
the company uses the discounted cash flow dcf approach to develop an estimate of fair value 
the dcf approach recognizes that current value is premised on the expected receipt of future economic benefits 
indications of value are developed by discounting projected future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the market approach was not used to value the food products technology and technology licensing reporting units the reporting units because insufficient market comparables exist to enable the company to develop a reasonable fair value of its intangible assets due to the unique nature of each of the company s reporting units 
the dcf approach requires the company to exercise judgment in determining future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future product sales  which are inherently difficult to predict 
these net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the dcf associated with the technology licensing reporting unit is based on the agreement with monsanto 
under the agreement  monsanto has agreed to pay landec ag a license fee of million in cash per year for five years beginning in december  and a fee of million if monsanto elects to terminate the agreement  or million if monsanto elects to purchase landec ag 
if the purchase option is exercised before the fifth anniversary of the agreement  or if monsanto elects to terminate the agreement  all annual license fees that have not been paid to landec ag will become due upon the purchase or termination 
as of may   the fair value of the technology licensing reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  is more than double its book value  and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
the discount rate utilized approximates the risk free interest rate as the cash flow stream is guaranteed under the terms of the agreement 
a increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the excess of fair value over book value 
the dcf associated with the food products technology reporting unit is based on management s five year projection of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of apio and the industry categories in which apio operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
as of may   the fair value of the food products technology reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  was approximately double its book value  and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
a increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the excess of fair value over book value 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
at may   the company had no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances  the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies under fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no  when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and that the company s positions may not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has accrued  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company s effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate 
any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the company s tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
stock based compensation the company s stock based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards rsus 
the company adopted sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard to i all stock based awards issued on or after may  and ii any outstanding stock based awards that were issued but not vested as of may  the estimated fair value for stock options  which determines the company s calculation of compensation expense  is based on the black scholes pricing model 
upon the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of calculating and recognizing the fair value of stock based compensation arrangements to the straight line  single option method 
compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock awards granted prior to may  will continue to be recognized using the straight line  multiple option method 
in addition  sfas r requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the time of grant 
as a result  the company uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates 
notes and advances receivable apio has made advances to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from crops harvested by the grower and delivered to apio 
advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from six to twelve months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value to be delivered or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines  the company may be unable to fully recoup its notes or advances receivable and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total notes or advances receivable of  as of may  recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no

changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest will be accounted for as equity transactions and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value 
other than the reporting requirements described above which require retrospective application  the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively in the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company is currently in the process of determining the impact and disclosure of this standard and expects it will result in a reclassification of income from the noncontrolling interest minority interest in apio cooling  lp  in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position 
upon adoption  all noncontrolling interest will be included as a component of stockholders equity and not in the statement of operations 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements

 accounting for collaborative arrangements that discusses how parties to a collaborative arrangement which does not establish a legal entity within such arrangement should account for various activities 
the consensus indicates that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties ie parties outside of the collaborative arrangement should be reported by the collaborators on the respective line items in their income statements pursuant to eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
additionally  the consensus provides that income statement characterization of payments between the participants in a collaborative arrangement should be based upon existing authoritative pronouncements  analogy to such pronouncements if not within their scope  or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election

the company will adopt statement in the first quarter of fiscal year and does not believe it will result in significant changes to reporting of subsequent events either through recognition or disclosure 
fair value disclosures in interim reports in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this staff position amends fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments at interim reporting periods 
this staff position is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  provided fsp no 
fas and fas described above are also early adopted 
the company will adopt fsp no 
fas in the first quarter of fiscal and do not believe it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements the company adopted sfas no 
on may  for financial assets and liabilities 
the company also adopted sfas no 
in which entities are permitted to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the company did not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial assets or liabilities under sfas no 
sfas no 
established a three tier hierarchy for fair value measurements  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data 
level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which would require the company to develop its own assumptions 
as of may   the company held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these included the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities for which the fair value is determined based on observable inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets 
therefore  the company has categorized its cash equivalents and marketable securities as level the company has no other financial assets or liabilities for which fair value measurement has been adopted

therefore  it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually 
the company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these costs include the following raw materials including produce  seeds and packaging  direct labor  overhead including indirect labor  depreciation  and facility related costs and shipping and shipping related costs 
the following discussion surrounding gross profit includes management s best estimates of the reasons for the changes for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as outlined in the table above 
apio value added the decrease in gross profit for apio s value added specialty packaged vegetable business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to decreased revenues coupled with increased raw material costs  primarily the cost of produce during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the gross margin for apio s value added business for fiscal year was compared to a gross margin of for fiscal year apio packaging the decrease in gross profit for apio packaging for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the decrease in minimum payments received from chiquita as a result of the amended chiquita license agreement 
apio trading apio s trading business is a buy sell business that realizes a commission based margin in the range 
the increase in gross profit during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to product mix changes to higher margin vegetable products from lower margin fruit products in our export business which resulted in a higher gross margin during fiscal year of compared to a gross margin of in fiscal year technology licensing the increase in technology licensing gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period of the prior year was not significant to consolidated landec gross profit

research and development efforts at apio are focused on the company s proprietary breatheway membranes used for packaging produce  with recent focus on extending the shelf life of bananas and other shelf life sensitive vegetables and fruit 
in the technology licensing business  the research and development efforts are focused on uses for the proprietary intelimer polymers outside of food 
the increase in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to increased headcount and increased consulting fees surrounding development work in our technology licensing area 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in sales and marketing expenses at apio due to the decreases in value added revenues and from decreases in general and administrative expenses at apio primarily as a result of not accruing bonuses this fiscal year whereas for the same period last year bonuses were accrued 
the decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses at corporate were primarily due to a decrease in auditing and tax fees coupled with the fact that in fiscal year the company amended its agreement with air products resulting in a non recurring charge of  these decreases were partially offset by legal fees associated with the company s pursuit of merger and acquisition activities 
other in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change interest income interest expense minority interest expense income taxes interest income the decrease in interest income for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to lower yields on investments  driven by both declines in interest rates and a shift in our investment portfolio to lower yielding investment vehicles 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the prior year was not significant 
minority interest expense the minority interest expense consists of the minority interest associated with the limited partners equity interest in the net income of apio cooling  lp 
the increase in the minority interest expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was not significant 
income taxes the increase in the income tax expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to the company utilizing all of its net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits during fiscal year for book income tax expense purposes which resulted in the estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year for federal and state income taxes increasing to from last year  partially offset by a decrease in pre tax net income

the increase in apio s value added revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to increased product offerings  new customers and increased sales to existing customers 
overall value added sales volume increased during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year 
the increase in value added sales volumes was higher than the increase in revenues due primarily to the introduction of several new value added products during fiscal year that had average sales prices per unit that were lower than the average sales prices per unit for other value added products

landec is not a party to any agreements with  or commitments to  any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above 
landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the continued development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms if at all 
landec believes that its cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months
