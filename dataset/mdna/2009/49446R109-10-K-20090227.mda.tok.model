historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements  including trends which might appear  should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
executive summary kimco realty corporation is one of the nation s largest publicly traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers 
as of december   the company had interests in  properties  totaling approximately million square feet of gla located in states  puerto rico  canada  mexico  chile  brazil and peru 
the company is self administered and self managed through present management  which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over years 
the executive officers are engaged in the day to day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the company  with nearly all operating functions  including leasing  asset management  maintenance  construction  legal  finance and accounting  administered by the company 
in connection with the tax relief extension act of the rma  which became effective january   the company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust reit  so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code  subject to certain limitations 
as such  the company  through its taxable reit subsidiaries  is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including i merchant building  through its wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries  which are primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion  ii retail real estate advisory and disposition services  which primarily focus on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and dist ressed and or bankrupt retailers and iii acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions 
the company will consider other investments through taxable reit subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise 
in addition  the company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management  leasing and operational support for those properties 
the company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers 
the company has made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment was  in management s judgment  priced below the value of the underlying assets 
however  these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets 
the company s strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively  primarily focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers 
the company continually evaluates its debt maturities  and  based on management s current assessment  believes it has viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact its expected financial results 
although the credit environment has become much more constrained since the third quarter of  the company continues to pursue opportunities with large commercial us and global banks  select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks 
the company has noticed a trend that the approval process from lenders has slowed  while pricing and loan to value ratios remain dependent on specific deal terms  in general  spreads are higher and loan to values are lower  but the lenders are continuing to complete financing agreements 
moreover  the company continues to assess and beyond to ensure the company is prepared if the current credit market dislocation continues 
the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions 
these conditions have forced some weaker retailers  in some cases  to declare bankruptcy and or close stores 
certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company s overall performance 
the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets 
the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout which will curtail the company s growth in the near term 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest  including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost  equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting p rinciples generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on  but not limited to  historical results  industry standards and current economic conditions  giving due consideration to materiality 
the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable  depreciable lives  valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities  valuation of joint venture investments  marketable securities and other investments and realizability of deferred tax assets 
application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  act ual results could materially differ from these estimates 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties  investments in joint ventures  marketable securities and other investments 
the company s reported net income is directly affected by management s estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned 
rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements 
in addition  leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the company s reported net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 
real estate the company s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and replacements  which improve and extend the life of the asset  are capitalized 
upon acquisition of operating real estate properties  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets primarily consisting of land  building  building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities primarily consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships  assumed debt and redeemable units issued in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
based on these estimates  the company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities 
the company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows buildings and building improvements to years fixtures  leasehold and tenant improvements terms of leases or useful including certain identified intangible assets lives  whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
real estate under development on the company s consolidated balance sheets represents ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the company may hold as long term investments 
these assets are carried at cost 
the cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development 
the company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity 
if  in management s opinion  the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
a gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for real estate sales 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale  the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions 
earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and  where applicable  are based upon an allocation of the investment s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 
the company s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties  consistent with its core business 
these joint ventures typically obtain non recourse third party financing on their property investments  thus contractually limiting the company s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment  and  due to the lender s exposure to losses  a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk 
the company s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments 
the company  on a selective basis  obtains unsecured financing for certain joint ventures 
these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amount s of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 
the company s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period 
capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property 
marketable securities the company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method 
all debt securities are generally classified as held to maturity because the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
debt securities which contain conversion features are generally classified as available for sale 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s marketable securities may be impaired 
a marketable security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security

the properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in  with the lessee having certain renewal option rights 
the company s cash equity investment was approximately million 
this equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases as amended 
the net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals  estimated unguaranteed residual value  unearned and deferred income and deferred taxes relating to the investment 
as of december   of these leveraged lease properties were sold  whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately million 
as of december   the remaining properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease 
as an equity participant in the leveraged lease  the company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt  which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease 
accordingly  this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease 
effects of inflation many of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
global market and economic conditions  real estate and retail shopping sector in the us  recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth throughout for the year ended december   continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues and declining equity and real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy 
in the third quarter  added concerns fueled by the federal government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association  the declared bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc  the us government provided loans to american international group inc and other federal government interventions in the us credit markets led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels and has led to the unprecedented deterioration of the us and international equity markets during the fourth quarter of historically  real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times 
different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress 
adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants which generally offer day to day necessities  rather than high priced luxury items 
in addition  the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic and tenant base 
the company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants  and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures 
in addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable  the company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability  which may include straight line rents  deferred lease costs  tenant improvements  tenant inducements and intangible assets 
the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions 
these conditions may result in our tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration 
these conditions also have forced some weaker retailers  in some cases  to declare bankruptcy and or close stores 
certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company s overall performance 
the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets 
the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout which will curtail the company s growth in the near term
