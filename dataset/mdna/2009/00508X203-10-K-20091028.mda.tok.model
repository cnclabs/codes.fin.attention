item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background as discussed in item  business  we are a diversified global manufacturer of a broad range of industrial products and systems  organized into four reportable segments  industrial  energy  electrical and engineered solutions 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our financial reporting segments were modified to reflect changes in the portfolio of businesses  due to acquisitions  as well as changes in business reporting lines 
the industrial segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the maintenance  industrial  infrastructure and production automation markets 
the energy segment provides joint integrity products and services  as well as umbilical  rope and cable solutions to the global oil gas  power generation and energy markets 
the electrical segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of a broad range of electrical products to the retail diy  wholesale  oem  utility and harsh environment markets 
the engineered solutions segment provides highly engineered position and motion control systems to oems in various vehicle markets  as well as a variety of other industrial products 

table of contents business update during fiscal  most of the end markets that we serve saw sales declines as the overall economic environment continued to worsen 
as a result of global economic uncertainties  significant declines in oem production in vehicle and marine markets  decreased demand for electrical products  inventory destocking by industrial customers and delays in maintenance and capital projects in energy markets  we implemented various cost reduction programs across all four segments 
these restructuring actions were initiated to reduce the impact of lower customer demand on our profitability 
we incurred approximately million of restructuring charges in fiscal  closed or exited over twenty facilities and reduced headcount by approximately 
the significant deterioration of end market demand in the rv and harsh environment electrical markets also resulted in million of non cash goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges during fiscal a summary of fiscal results and trends by segment are as follows industrial after a relatively strong first quarter of fiscal core sales growth of  economic conditions deteriorated dramatically  adversely impacting operating results in the industrial segment during the remainder of fiscal core sales declines  especially in the last two quarters of fiscal  were broad based across the diverse end markets and geographic regions served 
these declines in sales volumes coupled with restructuring charges and under absorption of manufacturing overhead resulted in reduced year over year operating margins for the industrial segment 
energy our energy segment experienced sales growth in fiscal due to acquisitions primarily the cortland companies and core sales growth in the first three fiscal quarters 
however  fourth quarter fiscal core sales declined from the prior year  due to reduced demand in energy exploration markets and certain oil gas installations deferring maintenance and capital projects 
operating margins in this segment have declined during fiscal as a result of unfavorable acquisition mix  reduced sales volumes and restructuring charges 
electrical our electrical segment experienced significant year over year core sales declines in each quarter of fiscal reflecting weak demand in retail diy due to sharp declines in consumer confidence  harsh environment electrical  transformer and utility markets 
the significant sales declines necessitated considerable restructuring efforts to consolidate facilities  reduce headcount and exit low margin business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we saw slight improvement in sales trends for the diy channel and marine aftermarket core sales were in the fourth quarter compared to in the third quarter and an improvement in operating margins as benefits from restructuring programs were realized 
during fiscal  we will continue to focus on execution of restructuring programs in this segment to improve its operating performance 
engineered solutions our engineered solutions segment was hit hardest by the unfavorable economic conditions that existed throughout fiscal significant declines in vehicle markets including auto  truck  off highway and specialty vehicle have impacted this segment s financial performance 
the segment s reduced operating margins were primarily due to lower sales volume  under absorbed fixed overhead costs  non cash impairment charges and restructuring charges 
significant restructuring actions have occurred in this segment  which are expected to improve margins and operating performance prospectively 
despite these challenging economic conditions  we continued to generate substantial cash flow from operations  including million during fiscal this cash flow  coupled with million of net proceeds from the june follow on equity offering and million of net proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses more than offset the million of cash used to fund acquisitions 
our priorities in fiscal include the continued strong execution of restructuring activities  investments in growth initiatives and cash flow generation

the results of operations for acquired businesses are included in our results of operations only since their respective acquisition dates 
see note  acquisitions in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition to the impact of acquisitions on operating results  currency translation rates can influence our reported results given that approximately half of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the strengthening of the us dollar in fiscal has unfavorably impacted results of operations due to the translation of non us dollar denominated subsidiary results

excluding foreign currency rate changes and sales from the sanlo acquisition  core sales declined for fiscal the core sales decline reflects sharply lower demand from vehicle oems serving the truck  automotive  rv  off highway  construction and agricultural markets 
weak economic conditions globally and our customers inventory destocking resulted in a substantial reduction in customer production levels and adversely impacted our sales 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal industrial segment industrial segment net sales in fiscal increased approximately million  or  to million from million in fiscal excluding sales from the three acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal and the million favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes  core sales grew in the sales increase reflects a continuation of strong global demand for high force hydraulic and mechanical tools provided across all markets served  along with modest price increases 
energy segment energy segment net sales for increased approximately million  or  to million from million in fiscal  reflecting core sales growth and sales added from the two acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal excluding acquisitions and the million favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes  core sales increased  reflecting market share gains and continued strong demand for our joint integrity products  rental assets and manpower services across the global energy market 
electrical segment electrical segment net sales in fiscal decreased approximately million  to million from million in fiscal excluding the million favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes  core sales declined in  the result of lower demand in the retail diy  transformer and marine markets 
approximately of the electrical segment sales are generated in north america  where economic conditions started to weaken since august   partially reflecting a sharp decline in consumer confidence 
year over year comparisons were also negatively affected by the loss of business with a major north american diy customer and our strategic decision to exit low margin products in our european electrical business 
engineered solutions segment engineered solutions segment net sales in fiscal increased approximately million  or  to million from million in fiscal excluding the million favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes and sales added from the maxima technologies acquisition  core sales were flat 
this reflected the net impact of lower vehicle market sales volume  offset by strong demand in the container hardware and truck markets 
vehicle market sales volume declined as a result of lower sales to rv oem s due to weak consumer demand  which was partially offset by strong truck demand in europe

similarly  fiscal operating profit included million of european electrical restructuring charges 
excluding these charges  the decline in operating profit for fiscal resulted from lower sales volumes and profit margins 
engineered solutions segment engineered solutions segment operating profit decreased by million from million for fiscal to an operating loss of million for fiscal the operating results for fiscal was adversely impacted by million of restructuring costs and a million non cash rv goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 
fiscal operating results were also significantly impacted by lower sales and production levels resulting in decreased absorption of fixed costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rate changes 
general corporate general corporate expenses decreased by million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due to lower incentive compensation expense  headcount reductions and the benefit of other general corporate cost reduction efforts

operating profit grew as a result of increased sales volumes from existing businesses  higher production levels resulting in increased absorption of fixed costs  customer price increases  acquisitions  operating efficiencies resulting from continuous improvement initiatives and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
partially offsetting these improvements were unfavorable sales and acquisition mix  higher intangible asset amortization and incentive compensation expense  increased raw material costs and investments in sales and marketing initiatives

the lower profit resulted from lower sales  decreased production levels  european electrical restructuring costs and other downsizing costs and unfavorable sales mix 
engineered solutions segment engineered solutions operating profit increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million for fiscal the operating profit growth was due to higher sales volumes  the maxima acquisition  customer price increases  the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes and increased low cost country sourcing 
partially offsetting these items were facility consolidation costs  material cost increases and higher incentive compensation expense 
general corporate general corporate expenses increased by approximately million  to million in fiscal  the result of business expansion  higher incentive compensation and training expenses  tax consulting fees and start up costs related to our new facility in taicang  china 
restructuring charges during  we committed to various restructuring initiatives including workforce reductions  plant consolidations  the continued movement of production and product sourcing to low cost countries and the centralization of certain support functions 
the total restructuring charges for these activities were million for fiscal we estimate we will incur an additional million of restructuring charges in fiscal we believe these restructuring actions will better align our resources with strategic growth opportunities  optimize existing manufacturing capabilities  improve our overall cost structure and deliver increased free cash flow and profitability 
see note  restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on restructuring charges 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed a specific restructuring plan in our european electrical business electrical segment  at a cumulative pre tax cost of million 
impairment charges significant adverse developments in the rv market during the first quarter of fiscal  including sharply lower wholesale motorhome shipments by oems  decreased consumer confidence and the lack of financing available to rv dealers and retail customers negatively impacted the financial results of our rv business 
as a result  during the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million non cash impairment charge related to the goodwill and long lived assets of the rv business 
poor economic conditions  low consumer confidence  increased unemployment and tight credit markets have negatively impacted consumer discretionary spending  resulting in a substantial reduction in recreational boating industry sales 
oem boat builders responded to the 
table of contents sharp drop in demand and high levels of finished goods inventory by suspending operations as well as eliminating brands and permanently closing facilities 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million non cash asset impairment charge million included in continuing operations and million included in discontinued operations related to the goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and long lived assets of the harsh environment electrical businesses included in the electrical segment 
see note  impairment charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
financing costs  net all debt is considered to be for general corporate purposes and therefore financing costs have not been allocated to our segments 
the million year over year increase in financing costs in fiscal reflected higher debt levels resulting from acquisitions  higher borrowing spreads pursuant to the amended credit agreement  as well as the write off of million of deferred financing costs due to the early extinguishment of our credit agreement term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal income tax expense our income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the us federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  tax minimization planning and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal  relative to the prior years  reflects the tax benefit on the impairment charges note  impairment charges and restructuring charges note  restructuring being recognized at the domestic tax rate which is higher than our consolidated global effective tax rate 
in addition  the effective income tax rate for fiscal includes the benefit of income tax reserve adjustments resulting from settling tax audits for amounts less than previously accrued and the lapsing of various tax statutes of limitations 
discontinued operations discontinued operations reflect the results of the acme aerospace and bh electronics  inc businesses  which were divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal for net cash proceeds of million 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the divested businesses in millions year ended august  net sales net gain on disposal earnings loss from operations of divested businesses income tax expense benefit earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax the loss from operations of divested businesses for the year ended august  includes million of non cash asset impairment charges related to bh electronics 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the cash flow attributable to operating  investing and financing activities for the three years ended august  in millions year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents effective cash flow management during fiscal resulted in substantial cash flow from operating activities of million and an improved financial position at august  operating cash flows benefited from lower working capital requirements  especially accounts receivable  given the decline in sales levels 
during fiscal  cash flows from operations  along with the million proceeds from the follow on equity offering and million of proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses funded million of strategic acquisitions including the acquisition of the cortland companies  million of capital expenditures and a net reduction in debt of million 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities  driven by net earnings of million  which included non cash expenses principally depreciation and amortization of million 
the net earnings were somewhat offset by additional working capital requirements of million 
these operating cash flows funded our million of capital expenditures and million of capital deployment in two strategic acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  consisting primarily of proceeds and the related tax benefits from stock option exercises 
borrowings on the revolving credit facility during fiscal were repaid by august  in fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased million as a result of strong free cash flow conversion 
record cash flows from operating activities of million and the million of cash provided from financing activities funded the million of capital expenditures and the million we paid to consummate strategic acquisitions 
operating cash flows benefited from million of net earnings including million of non cash expenses and a million reduction in working capital 
the financing activities in fiscal primarily included proceeds from term loans and the million senior note offering  offset by repayments of term loans 
primary working capital management we use primary working capital pwc as a percentage of sales as a key indicator of working capital management 
we define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable  outstanding balances on the accounts receivable securitization facility  and net inventory less accounts payable  divided by the past three months sales annualized 
the following table shows the components of the metric amounts in millions august  august  pwc pwc accounts receivable  net accounts receivable securitization total accounts receivable inventory  net accounts payable net primary working capital 
table of contents our net primary working capital percentage increased slightly year over year from to primarily as a result of the significant decrease in sales during the three months ended august  relative to the comparable period in the prior year 
despite the minor increase in pwc percentage  significant progress was made during fiscal to reduce working capital including a reduction in both accounts receivable and inventory 
accounts receivable balances  including amounts outstanding on the accounts receivable securitization facility  decreased million during fiscal as a result of lower sales levels and increased collection efforts  while inventory levels declined million during the same period  as a result of lower production levels and our efforts to destock inventory as demand in end markets slowed 
the reduction in inventory levels also lead to a decrease in purchasing activity and trade accounts payable balances  which declined million in fiscal liquidity on june   we amended our existing senior credit facility to provide additional flexibility with respect to financial covenants 
the amendment modified certain terms and financial covenants  increased the borrowing spread through november  from libor plus to libor plus  with subsequent increases or decreases based on the actual leverage ratio  increased the non use fee to and is secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property assets 
the amended senior credit facility  which matures on november   maintained the original borrowing capacity with a million revolving credit facility and million term loan the term loan was repaid in the fourth quarter of with proceeds from the follow on equity offering 
the two financial covenants included in the amended senior credit facility agreement are a maximum leverage ratio which was increased from its then current limit of to through august  and to through february   declining quarterly to by november  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which was reduced from to 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of august   and based on our forecast  continued compliance is expected through the term of the agreement 
our ability to comply with the covenants in the future depends on the global economy  credit market conditions and other factors 
holder s of our convertible notes have the option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the convertible notes for cash on november   november  and november  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
if certain conditions are met  holders may also convert the convertible notes into shares of our common stock prior to the scheduled maturity date 
in addition  we may redeem all or part of the convertible notes on or after november  at a cash redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
any repurchases of convertible notes will be funded through existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the senior credit facility 
in august  we repurchased million of convertible notes  for cash 
at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available liquidity under our senior credit facility 
we believe that the availability under the senior credit facility  combined with our existing cash on hand and funds generated from operations  will be adequate to meet operating  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
senior credit facility borrowings increased subsequent to august  to fund the increased working capital requirements associated with the expiration of our accounts receivable securitization program on september  see note  accounts receivable securitization and the repurchase of an additional million of convertible notes see note  debt 
seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under our senior credit facility 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
we have no single customer which generated or greater of fiscal net sales 

table of contents capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing activities consist of the assembly of components which are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows and borrowings under the senior credit facility 
reduced capital expenditures in fiscal resulted from a focused strategy to manage cash flows 
fiscal capital expenditures were unusually high and related to the construction of a million manufacturing facility in taicang  china 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
commitments and contingencies we lease certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  we pay the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable us to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the contractual obligations table below for further information 
we are contingently liable for certain lease agreements held by businesses included in our former electronics segment  which was spun off to shareholders in fiscal some of these businesses were subsequently sold to third parties 
if any of these businesses do not fulfill their obligations under the leases  we could be liable for such leases 
the present value of future minimum lease payments for these leases was million at august  we had outstanding letters of credit of million and million at august  and  respectively  the majority of which secure self insured workers compensation liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements as more fully discussed in note  accounts receivable securitization in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we were party to an accounts receivable securitization arrangement at august  trade receivables sold and being serviced by us were million and million at august  and  respectively 
we did not renew the accounts receivable securitization program on its scheduled maturity date of september  and  as a result  we utilized the senior credit facility to finance the corresponding million growth in accounts receivable 
contractual obligations the timing of payments due under our contractual commitments is as follows in millions payments due thereafter total long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases the above table excludes potential payments for acquisition earn out payments  as the exact amount and timing of payments is not known 
we made earn out payments on past acquisitions totaling million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for further information see note  acquisitions in the notes of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we have long term obligations related to our deferred compensation  pension and postretirement plans at august  our expected future contributions to these plans are provided in note  employee benefit plans in the notes of the consolidated financial statements 
the contractual obligation schedule for long term debt assumes we will call the remaining convertible notes or will have the notes put back to us in for further information  see note  debt 
interest for floating rate debt instruments  as calculated above  assumes august  interest rates remain constant 
our purchase obligations generally relate to amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for real estate leases  information technology services  including software and hardware support services and leases and telecommunications services 
those purchase obligations  such as leases  that are not cancelable are included in the table 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor  and as such  they are excluded from the contractual obligations table 
as discussed in note income taxes in the notes of the consolidated financial statements  we have unrecognized tax benefits of million and million at august  and  respectively 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was not included in the table of contractual obligations above because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
raw material costs and inflation we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our results 
we strive to offset such cost inflation by price increases to customers and driving operational cost reductions and improvement 
we also selectively utilize commodity derivative contracts to hedge against changing raw material prices 
however we did not have any significant derivative contracts in place at august  or see our risk factors for additional information on the company s commodity risks 
no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the overall rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations  after factoring in price increases and other manufacturing cost reductions 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million and million at august  and  respectively 
we perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
we believe that such estimates are made based on consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fair value method based on our judgments and assumptions 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  we use a discounted cash flow model 
the estimated fair value is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the annual impairment testing performed at august  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and  as such  no impairment existed 
indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to annual impairment testing 
on an annual basis  the fair value of the indefinite lived assets  based on a relief of royalty model  are evaluated to determine if an impairment charge is required 
we also review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
refer to note impairment charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairment charges recognized in fiscal a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
employee benefit plans we provide a variety of benefits to employees and former employees  including in some cases  pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on an august measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is based on the interest rate of non callable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of local market factors  participant demographics and benefit payment terms 
at august  and  the weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
a change in the discount rate by basis points would impact domestic benefit plan expense in fiscal by less than million 
at august  and  the weighted average discount rate on foreign benefit plans was and  respectively 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider the historical returns on plan assets  forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in common stock  index funds and bond funds 
the expected return on domestic benefit plan assets was and at august  and  respectively 
a basis point change in this assumption would impact fiscal domestic benefit plan expense by less than million 
due to the low amount of foreign benefit plan assets  changes in the expected return on plan assets does not materially impact our results of operations 
we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note  employee benefit plans for further discussion 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense also reflects best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and the effect of various tax planning strategies 
future tax 
table of contents authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded 
use of estimates we record reserves or allowances for customer returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  inventory  incurred but not reported medical claims  environmental matters  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that such estimates are made on a consistent basis and with appropriate assumptions and methods 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas no 
also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
we adopted sfas no 
on september   see note  fair value measurement for disclosures required under sfas no

fsp requires that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends be considered participating securities in undistributed earnings with common shareholders 
this staff position is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   as well as interim periods within those years 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact that will result from adopting fsp on our results of operations and financial disclosures when the standard is adopted during the first quarter of fiscal effective september   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included within note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
currency risk we have exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
of those us dollar denominated amounts  approximately were denominated in euro  with the remainder denominated in british pounds and various asian and other currencies 
our identifiable foreign currency exchange exposure results primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and from the repayment of intercompany loans between subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
we periodically identify areas where we do not have naturally occurring offsetting positions and then may purchase hedging instruments to protect against anticipated exposures 
at august  and  there are no material hedging instruments related to the purchase of products from affiliates and third party suppliers 
our financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables and receivables 
interest rate risk we have earnings exposure related to interest rate changes on our outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are based on libor interest rates 
we have periodically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk 
a basis point increase or decrease in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt at august  would result in a change in financing costs  net of approximately million on an annual basis 
commodity risk we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our results 
we strive to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion and utilize lead initiatives to further mitigate the impact of commodity raw material price fluctuations as improved efficiencies across all locations are achieved 
we also selectively utilize commodity derivative contracts to hedge against changing raw material prices 
we did not have any significant derivative contracts in place at august  or to hedge exposure to commodity risk
