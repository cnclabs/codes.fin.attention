item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of this report 
overview we are a provider of mobile voice and data communication services via satellite 
our communications platform extends telecommunications beyond the boundaries of terrestrial wireline and wireless telecommunications networks to serve our customer s desire for connectivity 
using in orbit satellites and ground stations  which we call gateways  we offer voice and data communications services to government agencies  businesses and other customers in over countries 
in early  old globalstar and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
we were formed in delaware in november for the purpose of acquiring substantially all the assets of old globalstar and its subsidiaries 
with bankruptcy court approval  we acquired old globalstar s assets and assumed certain of its liabilities in a two step transaction  with the first step completed on december   and the second step on april  the reorganization 
on january   we elected to be taxed as a c corporation  and on march   we converted from a delaware limited liability company to a delaware corporation 
going concern 
we currently lack sufficient resources to fund the procurement and deployment of our second generation constellation and other related construction costs and our on going operations  which are currently generating negative cash flows 
due to the worldwide economic crisis and the tight credit market  obtaining suitable additional financing remains challenging 
our registered public accounting firm s audit report on our consolidated financial statements as of december   and for the year then ended includes a going concern explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the going concern explanatory paragraph reflects substantial doubt about our ability to obtain this financing in a timely manner 
we have initiated plans to improve our liquidity by seeking a combination of debt and equity funding to procure and deploy our second generation constellation and related ground infrastructure as well as to fund our current operations 
our plans also include restructuring our operations by seeking to reduce costs in underperforming markets and consolidate resources around the world to operate our network more efficiently 
we have also undertaken a plan to market aggressively our simplex based products  including the spot personal satellite messenger  to generate incremental cash flow from operations 
if our plans are successful  we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to finance the anticipated costs to procure and deploy the second generation constellation and related ground infrastructure costs and to fund our current operations for at least the next months 
however  the successful execution of our plans is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that any portion of our plans will be achieved 
if we fail to obtain the necessary additional financing in a timely manner  the procurement and deployment of our second generation satellite constellation  related construction costs and our ongoing operations will be materially adversely impacted 
on march   we announced that coface  the export credit agency acting on behalf of the french government  has agreed to provide long term credit insurance in support of a proposed million credit facility to be extended to us by a syndicate of banks 
banks who have received initial credit committee approvals in relation to the credit facility  which will bear interest at approximately  include pnb paribas  natixis and societe generale 
the credit facility and our receipt of funding are subject to final documentation and closing conditions  and there can be no assurance that any closing will occur 

table of contents the principal closing conditions include the conversion into equity at closing of the senior secured term and revolving credit facility loans to us from thermo funding and our receipt of additional equity and contingent equity in an amount of approximately million  most of which is expected to be provided by thermo funding 
material trends and uncertainties 
our satellite communications business  by providing critical mobile communications to our subscribers  serves principally the following markets government  public safety and disaster relief  recreation and personal  oil and gas  maritime and fishing  natural resources  mining and forestry  construction  utilities  and transportation 
our industry has been growing as a result of favorable market reaction to new pricing plans with lower service charges  awareness of the need for remote communication services  increased demand for communication services by disaster and relief agencies and emergency first responders  improved voice and data transmission quality  a general reduction in prices of user equipment  and innovative data products and services 
nonetheless  as further described under risk factors  we face a number of challenges and uncertainties  including financial resources and liquidity 
we currently lack sufficient funds to fulfill our commitments for capital expenditures and support our current operations 
see going concern above 
the economy 
the current recession and its effects on credit markets and consumer spending is adversely affecting both sales of our products and services and our ability to obtain the additional financing necessary to fund our capital expenditures and current operations 
constellation life and health 
our current satellite constellation is aging 
we successfully launched our eight spare satellites in all of our satellites launched prior to have experienced various anomalies over time  one of which is a degradation in the performance of the solid state power amplifiers of the s band communications antenna subsystem our two way communication issues 
the s band antenna provides the downlink from the satellite to a subscriber s phone or data terminal 
degraded performance of the s band antenna amplifiers reduces the availability of two way voice and data communication between the affected satellites and the subscriber and may reduce the duration of a call 
when the s band antenna on a satellite ceases to be functional  two way communication is impossible over that satellite  but not necessarily over the constellation as a whole 
we continue to provide two way subscriber service because some of our satellites are fully functional but at certain times in any given location it may take longer to establish calls and the average duration of calls may be reduced 
there are periods of time each day during which no two way voice and data service is available at any particular location 
the root cause of our two way communication issues is unknown  although we believe it may result from irradiation of the satellites in orbit caused by the space environment at the altitude that our satellites operate 
the decline in the quality of two way communication does not affect adversely our one way simplex data transmission services  including our spot satellite messenger products and services  which utilize only the l band uplink from a subscriber s simplex terminal to the satellites 
the signal is transmitted back down from the satellites on our c band feeder links  which are functioning normally  not on our s band service downlinks 
we continue to work on plans  including new products and services and pricing programs to mitigate the effects of reduced service availability upon our customers and operations 
among 
table of contents other things  we requested thales alenia space to present a four part sequential plan for accelerating delivery of the initial satellites of our second generation constellation by up to four months 
to date  we have accepted the first two portions of this plan 
see part i  item a 
risk factors our satellites have a limited life and some have failed  which causes our network to be compromised and which materially and adversely affects our business  prospects and profitability 
competition and pricing pressures 
we face increased competition from both the expansion of terrestrial based cellular phone systems and from other mobile satellite service providers 
for example  inmarsat plans to commence offering satellite services to handheld devices in the united states in  and several competitors  such as ico global  are constructing or have launched geostationary satellites that provide mobile satellite service 
increased numbers of competitors  and the introduction of new services and products by competitors  increases competition for subscribers and pressures all providers  including us  to reduce prices 
increased competition may result in loss of subscribers  decreased revenue  decreased gross margins  higher churn rates  and  ultimately  decreased profitability and cash 
technological changes 
it is difficult for us to respond promptly to major technological innovations by our competitors because substantially modifying or replacing our basic technology  satellites or gateways is time consuming and very expensive 
approximately of our total assets at december  represented fixed assets 
although we plan to procure and deploy our second generation satellite constellation and upgrade our gateways and other ground facilities  we may nevertheless become vulnerable to the successful introduction of superior technology by our competitors 
capital expenditures 
we have incurred significant capital expenditures during and and we expect to incur additional significant expenditures through under the following commitments we estimate that procuring and deploying our second generation satellite constellation and upgrading our gateways and other ground facilities will cost approximately billion at a weighted average conversion rate of and excluding launch costs for the second satellites  internal costs and capitalized interest  which we expect will be reflected in capital expenditures through the following obligations are included in this amount in november   we entered into a contract with thales alenia space for the construction of our second generation constellation 
the total contract price  including subsequent additions  will be approximately million approximately million at a weighted average conversion rate of at december   including approximately million which was paid by us in us dollars at a fixed conversion rate of 
we have made payments in the amount of approximately million approximately million through december  under this contract 
at our request  thales alenia space has presented to us a four part sequential plan for accelerating delivery of the initial satellites by up to four months 
the expected cost of this acceleration will range from approximately million to million million to million at at december  
in  we accepted the first two portions of the thales four part sequential acceleration plan with an additional cost of million million at 
in march  we entered into a million approximately million at a weighted average conversion rate of agreement with thales alenia space for the construction of the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment collectively  the control network facility for our second 
table of contents generation satellite constellation 
we have made aggregate payments under this contract of approximately million approximately million through december  in september   we entered into a contract with our launch provider for the launch of our second generation satellites and certain pre and post launch services 
pursuant to the contract  our launch provider will make four launches of six satellites each  and we have the option to require our launch provider to make four additional launches of six satellites each 
the total contract price for the first four launches is million 
on july   we amended our agreement with our launch provider for the launch of our second generation satellites and certain pre and post launch services 
under the amended terms  we can defer payment on up to of certain amounts due to the launch provider 
the deferred payments will incur annual interest at to and become payable one month before the corresponding launch date 
we have made aggregate payments under this contract of approximately million through december  on may   we entered into a contract with hughes under which hughes will design  supply and implement the radio access network ran ground network equipment and software upgrades for installation at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations and satellite interface chips to be a part of the user terminal subsystem uts in our various next generation devices 
the total contract purchase price of approximately million is payable in various increments over a period of months 
we have the option to purchase additional rans and other software and hardware improvements at pre negotiated prices 
we have made aggregate payments under this contract of approximately million through december  we expensed million of these payments and capitalized million as second generation ground component 
on october   we signed an agreement with ericsson federal inc  a leading global provider of technology and services to telecom operators 
according to the million contract  ericsson will work with us to develop  implement and maintain a ground interface  or core network  system that will be installed at our satellite gateway ground stations 
the all internet protocol ip based core network system is wireless g g compatible and will link our radio access network to the public switched telephone network pstn and or internet 
design of the new core network system is now underway 
we have completed construction of a gateway in singapore at a total cost of approximately million 
this gateway was fully operational for simplex service in october we expect to introduce duplex service when our second generation satellite constellation becomes operational 
see going concern and liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our requirements and resources for funding these capital expenditures 
introduction of new products 
we work continuously with the manufacturers of the products we sell to offer our customers innovative and improved products 
virtually all engineering  research and development costs of these new products are paid by the manufacturers 
however  to the extent the costs are reflected in increased inventory costs to us  and we are unable to raise our prices to our subscribers correspondingly  our margins and profitability would be reduced 
simplex products personal tracking services and emergency messaging 
in early november  we introduced the spot satellite messenger  aimed at attracting both the recreational and commercial markets that require personal tracking  emergency location and messaging solutions for users that require these services beyond the range of traditional terrestrial and wireless communications 
using the globalstar simplex network and web based mapping software  this device provides consumers with the capability to trace or map the location of the user on google maps 
the product enables users to transmit messages to specific preprogrammed 
table of contents email addresses  phone or data devices  and to request assistance in the event of an emergency 
we are continuing to work on second generation spot like applications 
spot satellite messenger addressable market we believe the addressable market for our spot satellite messenger products and services in north america alone is approximately million units primarily made up of outdoor enthusiasts 
our objective is to capture of that market in the next few years 
the reach of our simplex system  on which our spot satellite messenger products and services rely  covers approximately of the world population 
we intend to market our spot satellite messenger products and services aggressively in our overseas markets including south and central america  western europe  and through independent gateway operators in their respective territories 
spot satellite messenger pricing we intend the pricing for spot satellite messenger products and services and equipment to be very attractive in the consumer marketplace 
annual service fees  depending whether they are for domestic or international service  currently range from to approximately for our basic level plan  and to approximately with additional tracking capability 
the equipment is sold to end users at to approximately per unit subject to foreign currency rates 
our distributors set their own retail prices for spot satellite messenger equipment and service 
spot satellite messenger distribution we are distributing and selling our spot satellite messenger through a variety of existing and new distribution channels 
we have signed distribution agreements with a number of big box retailers and other similar distribution channels including amazon 
com  bass pro shops  best buy canada  big sporting goods  big rock sports  cabela s  campmor  costco  joe s sport  london drug  outdoor and more  gander mountain  rei  sportsman s warehouse  the source by circuit city dealers  wal mart 
com  west marine  dbl distribution  dh distributions  and cwr electronics 
we currently sell spot satellite messenger products through approximately  distribution points and expect to reach  in we also sell directly using our existing sales force into key vertical markets and through our direct e commerce website www 
findmespot 
com 
spot satellite messenger products and services have been introduced only recently and their commercial introduction and their commercial success cannot be assured 
fluctuations in interest and currency rates 
debt under our credit agreement bears interest at a floating rate 
therefore  increases in interest rates will increase our interest costs if debt is outstanding 
a substantial portion of our revenue for the year ended december  is denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  a substantial majority of our obligations under the contracts for our second generation constellation and related control network facility are denominated in euros 
any decline in the relative value of the us dollar may adversely affect our revenues and increase our capital expenditures

ancillary terrestrial component atc 
atc is the integration of a satellite based service with a terrestrial wireless service resulting in a hybrid mobile satellite service 
the atc network would extend our services to urban areas and inside buildings in both urban and rural areas where satellite services currently are impractical 
we believe we are at the forefront of atc development and expect to be the first market entrant through our contract with open range described below 
in addition  we are considering a range of options for rollout of our atc services 
we are exploring selective opportunities with a variety of media and communication companies to capture the full potential of our spectrum and us atc license 

table of contents on october   we entered into an agreement with open range communications  inc that permits open range to deploy service in certain rural geographic markets in the united states under our atc authority 
open range will use our spectrum to offer dual mode mobile satellite based and terrestrial wireless wimax services to over rural american communities 
on december   we amended our agreement with open range 
the amended agreement reduced our preferred equity commitment to open range from million to million which investment was made in the form of bridge loans that converted into preferred equity at the closing of open range s equity financing 
under the agreement as amended  open range will have the right to use a portion of our spectrum within the united states and  if open range so elects  it can use the balance of our spectrum authorized for atc services  to provide these services 
open range has options to expand this relationship over the next six years  some of which are conditional upon open range electing to use all of the licensed spectrum covered by the agreement 
commercial availability is expected to begin in selected markets in the initial term of the agreement of up to years is co extensive with our atc authority and is subject to renewal options exercisable by open range 
either party may terminate the agreement before the end of the term upon the occurrence of certain events  and open range may terminate it at any time upon payment of a termination fee that is based upon a percentage of the remaining lease payments 
based on open range s business plan used in support of its million loan under a federally authorized loan program  the fixed and variable payments to be made by open range over the initial term of years indicate a value for this agreement between mhz pop 
open range satisfied the conditions to implementation of the agreement on january  when it completed its equity and debt financing  consisting of a million broadband loan from the department of agriculture rural utilities program and equity financing of million 
open range has remitted to us its initial down payment of million 
open range s annual payments in the first six years of the agreement will range from approximately million to up to million  assuming it elects to use all of the licensed spectrum covered by the agreement 
the amount of the payments that we will receive from open range will depend on a number of factors  including the eventual geographic coverage of and the number of customers on the open range system 
in addition to our agreement with open range communications  inc see item ancillary terrestrial component atc opportunities  we hope to exploit additional atc monetization strategies and opportunities in urban markets or in suburban areas that are not the subject of our agreement with open range 
our system is flexible enough to allow us to use different technologies and network architectures in different geographic areas

the table below sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service and equipment sales for the years ended december   and year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue of total revenue revenue of total revenue revenue of total revenue service revenue mobile voice and data fixed voice and data data simplex independent gateway operators other total service revenue subscriber equipment sales mobile equipment fixed equipment data and simplex accessories misc 
total subscriber equipment sales total revenue includes activation fees and engineering service revenue 
operating income loss 
we realized an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million in we attribute the increase in operating loss to lower service revenue  higher depreciation and operating costs from our acquisition of gateways in brazil 

table of contents subscribers and arpu for  and the following table set forth our average number of subscribers and arpu for retail  igo and simplex customers for  and the following numbers are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages 
year ended december  net change average number of subscribers for the period retail igo simplex arpu monthly retail igo simplex year ended december  net change average number of subscribers for the period retail igo simplex arpu monthly retail igo simplex december  december  net change ending number of subscribers retail igo simplex total december  december  net change ending number of subscribers retail igo simplex total the total number of net subscribers increased from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  although we experienced a net increase in our total customer base of from december  to december   our total service revenue decreased for the same period 
this is due primarily to lower contributions from subscribers in addition to the change in our subscriber mix 

table of contents independent gateway acquisition strategy currently  of the gateways in our network are owned and operated by unaffiliated companies  which we call independent gateway operators  some of whom operate more than one gateway 
we have no financial interest in these independent gateway operators other than arms length contracts for wholesale minutes of service 
some of these independent gateway operators have been unable to grow their businesses adequately due in part to limited resources 
old globalstar initially developed the independent gateway operator acquisition strategy to establish operations in multiple territories with reduced demands on its capital 
in addition  there are territories in which for political or other reasons  it is impractical for us to operate directly 
we sell services to the independent gateway operators on a wholesale basis and they resell them to their customers on a retail basis 
we have acquired  and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of  independent gateway operators when we believe we can do so on favorable terms and the current independent operator has expressed a desire to sell its assets to us  subject to capital availability 
we believe that these acquisitions can enhance our results of operations in three respects 
first  we believe that  with our greater financial and technical resources  we can grow our subscriber base and revenue faster than some of the independent gateway operators 
second  we realize greater margin on retail sales to individual subscribers than we do on wholesale sales to independent gateway operators 
third  we believe expanding the territory we serve directly will better position us to market our services directly to multinational customers who require a global communications provider 
however  acquisitions of independent gateway operators do require us to commit capital for acquisition of their assets  as well as management resources and working capital to support the gateway operations  and therefore increase our risk in operating in these territories directly rather than through the independent gateway operators 
in addition  operating the acquired gateways increases our marketing  general and administrative expenses 
our credit agreement limits to million the aggregate amount of cash we may invest in foreign acquisitions without the consent of our lenders 
in february  we purchased the venezuela gateway for million in cash to be paid over four years 
effective january   we acquired the central american gateway and other real property assets for million  paid principally in shares of our common stock 
in march  we acquired an independent gateway operator that owns three satellite gateway ground stations in brazil for million  paid principally in the shares of our common stock 
we also incurred transaction costs of million related to this acquisition 
we are unable to predict the timing or cost of further acquisitions because independent gateway operations vary in size and value 
performance indicators our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our earnings and cash flows 
these key performance indicators include total revenue  which is an indicator of our overall business growth  subscriber growth and churn rate  which are both indicators of the satisfaction of our customers  average monthly revenue per unit  or arpu  which is an indicator of our pricing and ability to obtain effectively long term  high value customers 
we calculate arpu separately for each of our retail  igo and simplex businesses  operating income  which is an indication of our performance  ebitda  which is an indicator of our financial performance  and 
table of contents capital expenditures  which are an indicator of future revenue growth potential and cash requirements 
seasonality our results of operations are subject to seasonal usage changes 
april through october are typically our peak months for service revenues and equipment sales 
government customers in north america tend to use our services during summer months  often in support of relief activities after events such as hurricanes  forest fires and other natural disasters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our revenues and expenses for the periods reported and the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  including contingent assets and liabilities  as of the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  long lived assets  income taxes  pension obligations  derivative instruments and stock based compensation  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are most important to understanding our financial results and condition and require complex or subjective judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we defer customer activation fees and recognize them over four to five year periods  which approximates the estimated average life of the customer relationship 
we periodically evaluate the estimated customer relationship life 
historically  changes in the estimated life have not been material to our financial statements 
we bill monthly access fees to retail customers and resellers  representing the minimum monthly charge for each line of service based on its associated rate plan  on the first day of each monthly bill cycle 
we bill airtime minute fees in excess of the monthly access fees in arrears on the first day of each monthly billing cycle 
to the extent that billing cycles fall during the course of a given month and a portion of the monthly services has not been delivered at month end  we prorate fees and defer fees associated with the undelivered portion of a given month 
under certain annual plans  where customers prepay for minutes  we defer revenue until the minutes are used or the prepaid time period expires 
unused minutes accumulate until they expire  usually one year after activation 
in addition  we offer other annual plans under which the customer is charged an annual fee to access our system 
we recognize these fees on a straight line basis over the term of the plan 
in some cases  we charge a per minute rate whereby we recognize the revenue when each minute is used 
occasionally we have granted to customers credits which are expensed or charged against deferred revenue when granted 
subscriber acquisition costs include items such as dealer commissions  internal sales commissions and equipment subsidies and are expensed at the time of the related sale 
we also provide certain engineering services to assist customers in developing new technologies related to our system 
we record the revenues associated with these services when the services are rendered  and we record the expenses when incurred 
we record revenues and costs associated with long term engineering contracts on the percentage of completion basis of accounting 
we own and operate our satellite constellation and earn a portion of our revenues through the sale of airtime minutes on a wholesale basis to independent gateway operators 
we recognize revenue 
table of contents from services provided to independent gateway operators based upon airtime minutes used by their customers and contractual fee arrangements 
if collection is uncertain  we recognize revenue when cash payment is received 
our annual plans sometimes called liberty plans require users to pre pay usage charges for the entire plan period  generally months  which results in the deferral of certain of our revenues 
under our revenue recognition policy for these annual plans  we defer revenue until the earlier of when the minutes are used or when these minutes expire 
we recognize any unused minutes as revenue at the expiration of a plan 
most of our customers have not used all the minutes that are available to them or have not used them at the pace anticipated  which has caused us to defer a portion of our service revenue 
during the second quarter of  we introduced an unlimited airtime usage service plan called the unlimited loyalty plan which allows existing and new customers to use unlimited satellite voice minutes for anytime calls for a fixed monthly or annual fee 
the unlimited loyalty plan incorporates a declining price schedule that reduces the fixed monthly fee at the completion of each calendar year through the duration of the customer agreement  which ends on june  customers have an option to extend their customer agreement by one year at the fixed price 
we record revenue for this plan on a monthly basis based on a straight line average derived by computing the total fees charged over the term of the customer agreement and dividing it by the number of the months 
if a customer cancels prior to the ending date of the customer agreement  we recognize the balance in deferred revenue 
we sell spot satellite messenger services as annual plans and bill them to the customer at the time the customer activates the service 
we defer revenue on such annual service plans upon activation and recognize it ratably over the service term 
at december  and december   our deferred revenue aggregated approximately million with million included in non current liabilities and million with million included in non current liabilities  respectively 
subscriber equipment revenue represents the sale of fixed and mobile user terminals  accessories and spot satellite messenger product 
we recognize revenue upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliveries are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to account separately for some or all of the deliveries that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliveries are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
inventory inventory consists of purchased products  including fixed and mobile user terminals  accessories and gateway spare parts 
we state inventory transactions at the lower of cost or market 
at the end of each quarter  we review product sales and returns from the previous twelve months and write off any excess and obsolete inventory 
cost is computed using the first in  first out fifo method 
we record 
table of contents inventory allowances for inventories with a lower market value or that are slow moving in the period of determination 
globalstar system  property and equipment our globalstar system assets include costs for the design  manufacture  test and launch of a constellation of low earth orbit satellites  including eight satellites previously held as ground spares which we launched in may and october  which we refer to as the space segment  and primary and backup terrestrial control centers and gateways  which we refer to as the ground segment 
we recognize loss from an in orbit failure of a satellite as an expense in the period it is determined that the satellite is not recoverable 
we regard these recently launched satellites as part of the second generation constellation which will be supplemented by the second generation satellites currently being constructed 
we estimate these second generation satellites will have an in orbit life of years 
we review the carrying value of the globalstar system for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value of the space segment and ground segment may not be recoverable 
we look to current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
if we determine an impairment exists  we calculate any related impairment loss based on fair value 
we believe our two way telecommunications services  or duplex services  after the launch of our second generation constellation  and simplex services will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow after our second generation system becomes fully operational  which is expected to be sometime in  to justify our carrying value for our second generation costs 
we began depreciating the satellites previously recorded as spare satellites and subsequently incorporated into the globalstar system on the date each satellite was placed into service the in service date over an estimated life of eight years 
income taxes until january   we were taxed as a partnership for us tax purposes notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
generally  our taxable income or loss  deductions and credits were passed through to our members 
effective january   we elected to be taxed as a corporation  and thus subject to the provisions as prescribed under subchapter c of the internal revenue code 
we also began accounting for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes february 
sfas no 
also requires that when an enterprise changes its tax status from non taxable to taxable  the effect of recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities is included in income from continuing operations in the period of change 
as a result of our election to be taxed as a corporation effective january   we recognized gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively at december  and  we recognized gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also established a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december  and  we had established valuation allowances of approximately million and million  respectively 
accordingly  at december  and  net deferred tax assets were approximately and million  respectively 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no

table of contents second generation satellites and launch costs and ground component in november   we entered into a contract with thales alenia space to construct low earth orbit satellites 
we entered into an additional agreement with thales alenia space in march for the construction of the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment collectively  the control network facility for our second generation satellite constellation 
in september  we and our launch provider entered into an agreement for the launch of our second generation satellites and certain pre and post launch services 
pursuant to the agreement  our launch provider will make four launches of six satellites each  and we have the option to require our launch provider to make four additional launches of six satellites each 
on may   we entered into a contract with hughes under which hughes will design  supply and implement the radio access network ran ground network equipment and software upgrades for installation at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations and satellite interface chips to be a part of the user terminal subsystem uts in our various next generation globalstar devices 
the total contract purchase price of approximately million is payable in various increments over a period of months 
we have the option to purchase additional rans and other software and hardware improvements at pre negotiated prices 
a portion of the payments made under this contract is recognized as an expense 
on october   we signed an agreement with ericsson  a leading global provider of technology and services to telecom operators 
according to the million contract  ericsson will work with us to develop  implement and maintain a ground interface  or core network  system that will be installed at our satellite gateway ground stations 
the all internet protocol ip based core network system is wireless g g compatible and will link our radio access network to the public switched telephone network pstn and or internet 
design of the new core network system is now underway 
we will begin to depreciate these assets once they are completed and placed into service 
pension obligations we have a company sponsored retirement plan covering certain current and past us based employees 
until june   substantially all of old globalstar s and our employees and retirees who participated and or met the vesting criteria for the plan were participants in the retirement plan of space systems loral  inc the loral plan  a defined benefit pension plan 
the accrual of benefits in the old globalstar segment of the loral plan was curtailed  or frozen  by the administrator of the loral plan as of october  prior to october   benefits for the loral plan were generally based upon compensation  length of service with the company and age of the participant 
on june   the assets and frozen pension obligations of the segment attributable to our employees were transferred into a new globalstar retirement plan the globalstar plan 
the globalstar plan remains frozen and participants are not currently accruing benefits beyond those accrued as of october  our funding policy is to fund the globalstar plan in accordance with the internal revenue code and regulations

pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or 
table of contents termination 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and liability measurement 
we determine the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december measurement date for the us pension plan 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
using these methodologies  we determined a discount rate of to be appropriate as of december   which is a decrease of percentage points from the rate used as of december  an increase of in the discount rate would have decreased our plan liabilities as of december  by million and a decrease of could have increased our plan liabilities by million 
a significant element in determining our pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
for the us pension plan  our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was for we defer the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets and  under certain circumstances  amortize it over future years of service 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net unrecognized pension actuarial losses of million 
these amounts represent potential future pension and postretirement expenses that would be amortized over average future service periods 
derivative instrument prior to december   we utilized a derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate swap agreement and a forward contract for purchasing foreign currency to minimize our risk from interest rate fluctuations related to our variable rate credit agreement and minimize our risk from fluctuations related to the foreign currency exchange rates  respectively 
we used the interest rate swap agreement and the forward contract for purchasing foreign currency to manage risk and not for trading or other speculative purposes 
at the end of each accounting period  we recorded the derivative instrument on our balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value 
the interest rate swap agreement and the forward contract for purchasing foreign currency did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and the forward contract for purchasing foreign currency were recognized as interest rate derivative gain loss and other income over the life of the agreements  respectively 
we terminated the interest swap agreement on december  by making a payment of approximately million 
stock based compensation effective january   as a result of our initial public offering  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment sfas r  and related interpretations  or sfas r  to account for stock based compensation using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated our prior period results 
among other things  sfas r requires that compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements for both employee and non employee share based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
additionally  stock based compensation expense includes an estimate for pre vesting forfeitures and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards on a straight line basis  which is generally commensurate with the vesting term

table of contents currently  our principal sources of liquidity are our credit agreement with thermo funding  our existing cash and internally generated cash flow from operations  if positive 
at january   our principal short term liquidity needs were to make payments to procure our second generation satellite constellation  construct the control network facility and launch related costs  in a total amount not yet determined  but which will include approximately million payable to thales alenia space by december  under the purchase contract for our second generation satellites and million payable to thales alenia space by december under the contract for construction of the control network facility  respectively  to make payments related to our launch for the second generation satellite constellation in the amount of million payable to our launch provider by december   to make payments related to the construction of our second generation ground component in the amount of million by december   and to fund our working capital which was a deficit of million at december   we expect this deficit to increase further in our liquidity sources at december  are insufficient to fund our short term or long term needs 
we must obtain additional financing to fund the procurement and deployment of our second generation constellation and other related construction costs and our on going operations  which are currently generating negative cash flows 
due to the worldwide economic crisis and the tight credit market  obtaining suitable financing remains challenging 
our registered public accounting firm s audit report on our consolidated financial statements as of december   and for the year then ended includes a going concern explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the going concern explanatory paragraph reflects substantial doubt about our ability to obtain this financing in a timely manner 
we are pursuing a number of options involving issuance of additional debt  equity or both to obtain the required funding as well as seeking to reduce our internal costs and aggressively grow our revenues 
we cannot assure you that sufficient additional financing will be obtainedon acceptable terms  if at all 
if we fail to obtain necessary additional financing  the procurement and deployment of our second generation satellite constellation  related construction costs and our ongoing operations will be materially adversely impacted 
we could default on our commitments to our satellite  launch  ground component and other third party vendors  possibly leading to termination of our second generation construction contracts or other contracts some of which have substantial termination fees 
we may also be required to reduce substantially our ongoing operations or discontinue operations all together 
if we do not acquire and deploy our second generation constellation and or discontinue operations  we may lose our fcc license  international spectrum rights and or atc authority in the united states 
if we lose our fcc license  rights to international spectrum or atc authority  we will lose the right to operate our business in those parts of the world and may not be able to continue as a going concern and would be required to sell our satellite business or assets in those areas of the world or cease operations all together 
in addition  we may have difficulty maintaining existing relationships  or developing new relationships  with suppliers or vendors as a result of our financial condition 
our suppliers or vendors could choose to provide supplies or services to us on more stringent payment terms than those currently in place  such as by requiring advance payment or payment upon delivery of such supplies or services  which would have an adverse impact on our short term cash flows 
as a result  our ability to retain current customers  attract new customers and maintain contracts that are critical to our operations may be adversely affected 
finally  these events may result in defaults under our current financing arrangements which would permit acceleration of our indebtedness and exercise of remedies by our lenders

table of contents agreement  and an additional million shares of common stock that  from time to time  may be borrowed from us by the borrower pursuant to the share lending agreement and the underwriting agreement and subsequently offered and sold at prevailing market prices at the time of sale or negotiated prices 
the sale of the borrowed shares was registered under the s 
we used two prospectus supplements for the transaction  one for the sale of the convertible notes and the underlying common stock and the other for the sale of the borrowed shares 
we filed the prospectus supplement for the sale of the borrowed shares pursuant to rule b on april  and pursuant to rule b on april  at december   approximately million borrowed shares remained outstanding 
the borrower returned to us an additional million borrowed shares in january we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares pursuant to the share lending agreement but will receive a nominal lending fee of per share for each share of common stock that we loan to the borrower pursuant to the share lending agreement 
the borrower will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of borrowed shares pursuant to the share lending agreement 
at our election  the borrower may remit to us cash equal to the market value of the corresponding borrowed shares instead of returning the borrowed shares to us as a result of conversions by note holders 
the shares that we loaned to the borrower will be issued and outstanding for corporate law purposes  and accordingly  the holders of the borrowed shares will have all of the rights of a holder of our outstanding shares  including the right to vote the shares on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions that we may pay or makes on its outstanding shares of common stock 
however  under the share lending agreement  the borrower has agreed to pay  within one business day after the relevant payment date  to us an amount equal to any cash dividends that we pay on the borrowed shares  and to pay or deliver to us  upon termination of the loan of borrowed shares  any other distribution  in liquidation or otherwise  that we make on the borrowed shares 
to the extent the borrowed shares we initially lent under the share lending agreement and offered in the common stock offering have not been sold or returned to it  the borrower has agreed that it will not vote any such borrowed shares 
the borrower has also agreed under the share lending agreement that it will not transfer or dispose of any borrowed shares  other than to its affiliates  unless the transfer or disposition is pursuant to a registration statement that is effective under the securities act 
however  investors that purchase the shares from the borrower and any subsequent transferees of such purchasers will be entitled to the same voting rights with respect to those shares as any other holder of our common stock 
on december   we entered into amendment no 
to share lending agreement with the borrower and the borrowing agent 
pursuant to amendment no  we have the option to request the borrower to deliver cash instead of returning borrowed shares of company common stock upon any termination of loans at the borrower s option  at the termination date of the share lending agreement or when the outstanding loaned shares exceed the maximum number of shares permitted under the share lending agreement 
the consent of the borrower is required for any cash settlement  which consent may not be unreasonably withheld  subject to the borrower s determination of applicable legal  regulatory or self regulatory requirements or other internal policies 
any loans settled in shares of company common stock will be subject to a return fee based on the stock price as agreed by us and the borrower 
the return fee will not be less than per share or exceed per share 
as a result of this amendment  we believe that  under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as currently in effect  the approximately million borrowed shares currently outstanding under the share lending agreement will be considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting our earnings per share 
prior to this amendment  the borrowed shares were 
table of contents not considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting our earnings per share due to the substantial elimination of the economic dilution due to contractual provisions  that otherwise would have resulted from the issuance of the borrowed shares

however  the new award agreements extend the vesting period by up to two years and provide for payment in shares of common stock instead of cash  thereby enabling us to conserve our cash for capital expenditures for the procurement and launch of our second generation satellite constellation and related ground station upgrades 
one of the original five participants left our employ in january and agreed to provide consulting services through december  if he fulfills all the terms of the consulting agreement  he will receive all but  of the original compensation in accordance with a modified vesting schedule

in some cases insufficient supplies of us currency may require us to accept payment in other foreign currencies 
we reduce our currency exchange risk from revenues in currencies other than the us dollar by requiring payment in us dollars whenever possible and purchasing foreign currencies on the spot market when rates are favorable 
we currently do not purchase hedging instruments to hedge foreign currencies 
however  our credit agreement requires us to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent not later than days after the end of any quarter in which more than of our revenue is originally denominated in a single currency other than us or canadian dollars 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments  we have entered into two separate contracts with thales alenia space to construct low earth orbit satellites for our second generation satellite constellation and to provide launch related and operations support services  and to construct the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units 
table of contents and in orbit test equipment for our second generation satellite constellation 
a substantial majority of the payments under the thales alenia space agreements  are denominated in euros 
our interest rate risk arises from our variable rate debt under our credit agreement  under which loans bear interest at a floating rate based on the us prime rate or libor 
assuming that we borrowed the entire million in revolving and term debt available under our credit agreement  a change in interest rates would result in a change to interest expense of approximately million annually 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased significantly as a result of contracts for the construction of our second generation constellation satellite and the related control network facility  which are primarily payable in euros 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar  on the remaining balance related to these contracts of approximately million on december   would result in million of additional payments
