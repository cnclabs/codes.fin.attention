item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
statements that are not historical in nature are forward looking statements 
onebeacon cannot promise that our expectations in such forward looking statements will turn out to be correct 
onebeacon s actual results could be materially different from and worse than our expectations 
see forward looking statements on page for specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
the following discussion also includes three non gaap financial measures  adjusted book value per common share  adjusted common shareholders equity and loss and loss adjustment expenses ratio prior to reserve reallocation and total combined ratio prior to reserve reallocation that have been reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures see below and pages and 
onebeacon believes these measures to be useful supplements to the comparable gaap measures in evaluating onebeacon s financial performance 
book value and adjusted book value per common share for the year ended december  we ended the full year with a book value per share of reflecting a decrease for the year ended december   adjusted for the defeasance of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and including dividends 
the reduction was mainly due to a total return on invested assets for the year ended december  we reported comprehensive net loss of million in the year ended december   compared to comprehensive net income of million in the year ended december  our underwriting results although solid also contributed to the decline in book value per share and adjusted book value per share with a gaap combined ratio of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the combined ratio was primarily due to million of catastrophe losses in the year ended december   primarily related to hurricanes ike and gustav and catastrophe losses from tornados in the southeastern united states experienced in the first quarter of total net written premiums increased in the year ended december  to  million  compared to  million in the year ended december   driven primarily by premiums from our new specialty collector car and boat business 
the following table presents our adjusted book value per common share and reconciles this non gaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap measure 
as of december  in millions except per share amounts numerator common shareholders equity    remaining adjustment of subsidiary preferred stock to face value adjusted common shareholders equity   denominator common shares outstanding book value per common share adjusted book value per common share represents a non gaap financial measure 
includes the impact of repurchases of class a common shares made through the company s share repurchase program which commenced in the third quarter of overview we are a property and casualty insurance writer that provides a range of specialty insurance products as well as a variety of segmented commercial and personal insurance products 
with roots dating back to  we have been operating for more than years and have many long standing relationships with independent agencies  which constitute our primary distribution channel 
we consist of a group of operating companies which are us based property and casualty insurance writers  most of which operate in a multi company pool 
pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool s capital and surplus rather than just on its own capital and surplus 
under such arrangements  the members share substantially all insurance business that is written  and allocate the combined premiums  losses and expenses 
in the year ended december   our net written premiums totaled billion and we had total assets of billion and total common shareholders equity of billion at december  our historical consolidated financial information prior to our initial public offering  we consolidated certain other businesses for gaap financial reporting and us tax purposes that are no longer held by us the internal reorganization 
these other businesses are therefore reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements in this report as discontinued operations 
furthermore  on august   we exchanged our investment in the common shares of montpelier re holdings  ltd 
montpelier  for an agreed upon portfolio of common equity and fixed maturity securities of equal value owned by white mountains 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations montpelier investment 
in the fourth quarter of  we commuted our two quota share reinsurance arrangements with other subsidiaries of white mountains 
our segments our reportable segments are primary insurance operations  affiliate quota shares and other operations 
primary insurance operations 
our primary insurance operations segment includes the results of substantially all of our insurance operations  with the exception of certain quota share arrangements with affiliates of white mountains as described below 
our primary insurance operations segment also includes run off business which primarily consists of national accounts  certain specialty programs and regional agency business transferred to liberty mutual effective november  see business run off 
in the first quarter of  we began to include community banks within commercial lines 
community banks was formerly reported in specialty lines 
the reporting change was undertaken to better align the reported results of our underwriting units with their product and management structure 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
affiliate quota shares 
during and  we entered into two quota share reinsurance arrangements with other subsidiaries of white mountains  primarily for white mountains capital management purposes 
these agreements were commuted in the fourth quarter of in connection with our initial public offering 
under the sirius quota share  we ceded between and of business written  effective april   to sirius 
under the esurance quota share  effective january   we assumed approximately of business written by esurance  which includes business written by its wholly owned subsidiary 
other operations 
our other operations segment consists of the activities of onebeacon insurance group  ltd 
and our intermediate subsidiary holding companies which include onebeacon us enterprises holdings  inc and onebeacon us holdings  inc  both us domiciled companies  as well as various intermediate holding companies domiciled in the united states  gibraltar  luxembourg and bermuda 
revenues we account for insurance policies that we write in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas 
premiums written are recognized as revenues and are earned ratably over the term of the related policy 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to future insurance coverage provided by policies 
autoone  one of our subsidiaries  which acts as a lad servicing carrier  enters into contractual arrangements with insurance companies to assume private passenger and commercial automobile assigned risk exposures in states and the district of columbia 
autoone receives lad and clad servicing fees from these other companies for assuming these risks 
in addition  autoone chooses to write certain policies voluntarily by taking risks out of the nyaip 
these policies generate takeout credits which can be sold for fees  which we refer to as take out fees  to other carriers 
these other carriers in turn can use such credits to reduce their obligations to write assigned risk business 
autoone s lad and clad servicing and take out fees are recorded as written premium when billed and are earned ratably over the term of the related policy to which the fee relates 
deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs represent commissions  premium taxes  brokerage expenses and other costs that are directly attributable to and vary with the production of new business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the applicable premium recognition period 
deferred acquisition costs are limited to the amount expected to be recovered from future earned premiums and anticipated investment income 
loss and loss adjustment expenses loss and lae are charged against income as incurred 
unpaid loss and lae reserves are based on estimates generally determined by claims adjusters  legal counsel and actuarial staff of the ultimate costs of settling claims  including the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
unpaid loss and lae reserves represent management s best estimate of ultimate loss and lae  net of estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries  if applicable 
such estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current operations 
the process of estimating loss and lae involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amount of expense to be incurred could be considerably greater than or less than the amounts currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries enter into ceded reinsurance contracts from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to concentration of risk and to limit losses arising from catastrophic events 
the majority of such reinsurance contracts are executed through excess of loss treaties and catastrophe contracts under which a third party reinsurer indemnifies our insurance subsidiaries for a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
we also have entered into quota share treaties with reinsurers under which all risks meeting prescribed criteria are ceded to third party reinsurers on a pro rata basis 
the amount of each risk ceded by us is subject to maximum limits that vary by line of business and type of coverage 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts sfas  and emerging issues task force topic no 
d eitf topic d  as applicable 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
our ability to collect our reinsurance recoverables is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers with whom we have entered into reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  principally placing reinsurance with those reinsurers with strong financial condition  industry ratings and underwriting ability 
management monitors the financial condition and ratings of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
reinsurance premiums  commissions  expense reimbursements and reserves related to reinsured business are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premiums written 
expense allowances received in connection with reinsurance ceded have been accounted for as a reduction of the related policy acquisition costs 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock we had two classes of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries which were redeemed in the years ended december  and these instruments were classified as liabilities and were carried at their historical carrying values 
all dividends and accretion on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock have been recorded as interest expense 
see note mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation compensation philosophy our executive compensation policies are designed with one goal in mind  namely  the maximization of shareholder value over long periods of time 
we believe that this goal is best pursued by utilizing a pay for performance program that serves to attract and retain superior executive talent and provide management with performance based incentives to maximize shareholder value 
through this compensation program  we seek to maximize shareholder value by aligning closely the financial interests of management with those of our shareholders 
the cost of all incentive compensation is fully accrued and expensed 
compensation of our senior management team  including our named executive officers  consists primarily of three components base salary  annual bonus and long term incentive awards 
base salaries have been capped at  annual bonus targets for all senior executives are  with the exception of the chief executive officer at  of base salary 
long term incentives for senior executives have in the past been comprised of performance shares and or performance units 
under these instruments  payouts are explicitly tied to white mountains or onebeacon s performance over a three year period and are highly variable the actual number of shares units paid out at the end of the cycle will range from to of target depending on performance against established goals 
see note employee share based incentive compensation plans of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation primary insurance operations through performance cycles for these cycles  onebeacon revised the design of its long term incentive plans from prior plan designs principally to use onebeacon performance units instead of white mountains performance shares  with performance targets primarily tied to onebeacon s adjusted combined ratio 
each unit is initially valued at and compounds in value over the performance period by the underwriting return on capital achieved by onebeacon 
in the case of certain senior officers of our primary insurance operations segment  a portion of their long term incentive compensation in these periods had been denominated in white mountains performance shares 
as a result of the shift from white mountains performance shares to onebeacon performance units  onebeacon s incentive compensation expense associated with these performance cycles is no longer significantly impacted by changes in the market price of white mountains common shares 
prior to february  the value of onebeacon s performance shares was based upon the market price of an underlying white mountains common share wtm performance shares 
in february  the onebeacon compensation committee of the board the compensation committee canceled all of onebeacon s wtm performance shares outstanding for the and performance cycles and replaced the awards with two performance share grants  a one year performance cycle and a two year performance cycle  whose value is based upon the market price of an underlying onebeacon common share ob performance shares 
in the performance cycle  a total of  performance shares were earned based upon a performance factor of 
as of december    performance shares were outstanding with respect to the performance cycle 
performance cycle in february  the compensation committee approved the principal performance share goal of the onebeacon long term incentive plan the incentive plan to be growth in its intrinsic business value per share gibvps 
gibvps is defined by the compensation committee with respect to each award cycle 
for the performance cycle  the compensation committee defined gibvps to be a weighted measure comprised of growth in adjusted book value per share  underwriting return on equity and growth in our price per common share 
as of december    performance shares were outstanding with respect to the performance cycle 
performance cycle in february  the compensation committee defined gibvps for the performance cycle to be a weighted measure comprised of growth in adjusted book value per share and underwriting return on equity 
as of december    performance shares were outstanding with respect to the performance cycle 
restricted stock units in connection with onebeacon s initial public offering  options were issued to certain key employees as a one time incentive 
the options did not include a mechanism to reflect the contribution to total return from the regular quarterly dividend 
as a result  in february  the compensation committee approved a grant of restricted stock units as a supplement to the initial public offering stock grant 
the performance goal for the restricted stock units is growth in adjusted book value per share 
as of december    restricted stock units were outstanding 
compensation other operations in connection with the internal reorganization  on august   all employees of our other operations segment became employees of white mountains 
therefore  we will no longer incur significant compensation expense in our other operations segment 
share based compensation recognition our share based compensation plans consist of performance shares which are typically settled in cash  stock options which were granted in connection with our initial public offering and restricted stock units 
effective january   we account for these share based compensation plans in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment or sfas r 
compensation cost is measured and recognized based on the current market price of the underlying common shares and on the number of shares that are expected to vest 
prior to adoption of sfas r  we accounted for these plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  whereby we recognized compensation cost based on the current market price of the underlying common shares and on the assumption that all shares awarded would vest 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  compensation cost gave effect only to actual rather than assumed forfeitures 
purchase accounting in connection with purchase accounting for the onebeacon acquisition  we were required to adjust to fair value our loss and lae reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables by million and million  respectively  on our balance sheet as of june  this net change to loss and lae reserves of million is being accreted through an income statement charge ratably with and over the period the claims are settled

in addition  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the us statutory rate of due to the settlement of the federal income tax audits related to tax years prior to and tax benefits recognized on the exchange of our investment in msa

the reallocation had no impact on total primary insurance operations 
for further discussion  see consolidated results year ended december  versus year ended december  the tables above for the year ended december  reflect our loss and lae ratios and total combined ratios prior to the reserve reallocation and reconciles these non gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap measures 
primary insurance operations year ended december  versus year ended december  specialty lines 
net written premiums for specialty lines increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million in net written premiums from our specialty collector car and boat business that we began writing in the second quarter of the increase compared to prior year was also due to writings from ebi which we acquired in the third quarter of  as well as growth in a h and obgr 
in addition  net written premiums at obpp increased million

the decrease in the loss and lae ratio was mainly due to points of favorable loss reserve development in the year ended december  primarily related to lower than expected severity in professional liability  compared with points in the year ended december  primarily related to professional liability 
partially offsetting this decrease was higher current accident year catastrophe losses in the year ended december  which included points primarily related to hurricane ike  compared to points of current accident year catastrophe losses in the year ended december  the increase in the expense ratio was mainly due to changes in mix of business within the specialty lines businesses and the mix of products offered within those businesses 
our specialty collector car and boat business and some of our other new specialty lines businesses pay higher agent commissions than the previous mix of business 
also  at obpp  our increased writings of our long term care product and decreased writings of our provider excess insurance product carry a higher and lower commission ratio  respectively  and shifted the expense ratio upward 
in addition  during the year ended december   we incurred additional transition costs associated with the new management team at obpp 
the expense ratio for the year ended december  included a point favorable impact from the partial settlement of our qualified pension plan liabilities  partially offset by points of office consolidation costs 
commercial lines 
net written premiums for commercial lines decreased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the middle market division  reflecting the more competitive marketplace  partially offset by an increase of million in the small business division  principally driven by our small business package products 
the commercial lines combined ratio for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio increased points to  while the expense ratio decreased points to 
the increase in the loss and lae ratio was due in part to a point increase in non catastrophe losses in the year ended december  mainly due to higher large losses including losses in our middle market division related to winter weather in the northeastern united states experienced in the first quarter and large property losses in the third quarter  compared with an unusually low level of large losses experienced in the year ended december  additionally  the loss and lae ratio increased due to points of current accident year catastrophe losses in the year ended december  primarily related to hurricane ike in our middle market and small business divisions and losses from tornados in the southeastern united states in our middle market division in the first quarter  compared to points of catastrophe losses in the year ended december  expenses for the year ended december  were essentially flat compared to the prior year 
the year ended december  included a point benefit from the partial settlement of our qualified pension plan liabilities  which was offset by points of office consolidation costs 
personal lines 
net written premiums for personal lines decreased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in traditional personal lines  net written premiums decreased million due to the decision to cease writing business in houston general insurance exchange houston general in late  lower new business associated with coastal restrictions implemented at adirondack insurance and higher reinsurance costs at adirondack insurance  lower premium volume from the involuntary market in massachusetts  and the discontinuation of surplus lines business 
in january  houston general entered into a reinsurance agreement with universal holdings of north america universal under which houston general ceded million of unearned premiums to universal 
further  net written premiums at autoone decreased million due to significant declines in new york s assigned risk pool 
with respect to the new york assigned risk pool  market trends indicate that assigned risk volumes are expected to decline to approximately million in  which was consistent with and down from million in and million in assigned risk volumes in new jersey are also expected to decline in market trends indicate that the assigned risk pool in new jersey is expected to decline to approximately million in  down from million in  million in and million in we expect a reduction in autoone s premium volume reflective of these trends 
the personal lines combined ratio for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio increased points to  while the expense ratio decreased by points to 
the increase in the loss and lae ratio was primarily due to points of adverse loss reserve development in the year ended december   mainly on personal automobile liability at autoone compared with points of favorable loss reserve development in the year ended december   primarily related to automobile liability losses in traditional personal lines and at autoone 
the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to decreased other underwriting expenses as a result of the decision to cease writing business in houston general and actions taken in to better align personal lines staffing with our business needs 
the expense ratio for the year ended december  also included a point benefit from a state premium tax refund  a point benefit related to the partial settlement of our qualified pension plan liabilities and points of office consolidation costs 
effective january   in an effort to further reduce our property catastrophe exposure in the northeast  we entered into a quota share agreement with a select group of reinsurers  under which we will cede of our northeast homeowners business written through obic and its subsidiary companies  along with adirondack insurance and new jersey skylands insurance association in new york and new jersey  respectively 
the program provides supplemental protection to previously established reinsurance 
the reinsurers are all rated a excellent  the third highest of fifteen ratings or better by am best 
the program is expected to result in ceded premiums of approximately million in run off 
run off business generated an underwriting loss of million in the year ended december   compared to an underwriting loss of million million excluding a million increase to loss and lae reserves resulting from the reserve reallocation in the year ended december  the year ended december  includes incurred loss and lae of million million of incurred unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae related to the liberty mutual settlement described in part i  item legal proceedings  compared with million excluding the reserve reallocation in the year ended december  the year ended december  also includes a million benefit from the partial settlement of our qualified pension plan liabilities 
asbestos and environmental exposures as described in critical accounting estimates  we have a reinsurance contract with nico for up to billion in old a e claims and certain other exposures 
under the terms of the nico cover  nico receives the economic benefit of reinsurance recoverables from certain of our third party reinsurers in existence at the time the nico cover was executed third party recoverables 
as a result  the third party recoverables serve to protect the billion limit of nico coverage for our benefit 
in september  we completed a study of our a e exposures 
this study considered  among other items  i facts  such as policy limits  deductibles and available third party reinsurance  related to reported claims  ii current law  iii past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  iv industry studies and events  such as recent settlements and asbestos related bankruptcies  and v collectibility of third party reinsurance 
based on the study  we increased our best estimate of our incurred losses ceded to nico  net of underlying reinsurance  by million to billion  which is within the billion coverage provided by the nico cover 
the increase in the estimate of incurred a e losses was principally driven by raised projections for claims related to asbestos 
based on the results of the study  we believe that  under all reasonable scenarios  ultimate incurred losses will not exceed the nico cover 
approximately billion of the estimated billion of incurred losses have been paid by nico through december  due to the nico cover  there was no impact to income or equity from the change in estimate 
the ratio of reserves net of third party recoverables for a e losses at december  to trailing three year average paid loss and allocated lae known in the industry as the survival ratio is years including the remaining available protection under the nico cover 
our reserves for a e losses at december  represent management s best estimate of our ultimate liability based on information currently available 
however  significant uncertainties  including but not limited to case law developments  medical and clean up cost increases and industry settlement practices  limit our ability to accurately estimate ultimate liability and we may be subject to a e losses beyond currently estimated amounts 
in addition  we remain liable for risks reinsured in the event that a reinsurer does not honor its obligations under reinsurance contracts 
to the extent that actual experience differs from our estimate of incurred a e losses and third party recoverables  future losses could exceed the million of protection remaining under the nico cover

net written premiums for specialty lines increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  excluding the agri business  to which the renewal rights were sold in the third quarter of  net written premiums increased by in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in net written premiums of million in specialty liability products at obpp  an increase of million at imu and million in a h which commenced operations in the specialty lines combined ratio for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio increased points to while the expense ratio decreased points to 
the increase in the loss and lae ratio was primarily due to large losses in the agri run off business 
the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to a point reduction of commission expense from fees received from fronting services in the year ended december  from qbe on renewals of agri business  as well as a point favorable impact from the partial settlement of our qualified pension plan liabilities  partially offset by points of office consolidation costs 
commercial lines 
net written premiums for commercial lines increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in the small business division  principally driven by our small business package products 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in the middle market division primarily due to lower premiums at obsp as a result of our strategy to manage our exposure to potential catastrophe losses 
the commercial lines combined ratio for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio decreased by points to  while the expense ratio decreased points to 
the decrease in the loss and lae ratio was primarily due to points of favorable loss reserve development for the year ended december  primarily related to property and general liability claims  partially offset by point increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven in part by the pricing environment in the year ended december  the loss and lae for the year ended december  included points of adverse loss reserve development mainly due to points of adverse loss reserve development on catastrophes primarily at obsp  related to hurricanes katrina and wilma and two catastrophes 
the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to lower policy acquisition expenses as a result of an increase to the deferral rate of commercial lines policy acquisition costs related to the expansion into new states  as well as a point favorable impact from the partial settlement of our qualified pension plan liabilities 
partially offsetting the impact of these favorable items was points of office consolidation costs in the year ended december   compared to points in the year ended december  personal lines 
net written premiums for personal lines decreased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in traditional personal lines  net written premiums decreased due to an increasingly competitive auto market  massachusetts state mandated rate decreases and the decision to cease writing business in houston general in late net written premiums for houston general were million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  further  net written premiums at autoone decreased due to significant declines in new york s and new jersey s assigned risk pools  as described above 
the reduction in autoone s premium volume is reflective of these trends 
the personal lines combined ratio for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio decreased points to while the expense ratio increased by points to 
the increase in the loss and lae ratio was primarily due to points of favorable loss reserve development in automobile liability in traditional personal lines and at autoone  compared to points of adverse development for the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease was higher than average large loss activity experienced in the first half of the increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to the adverse effect of a lower earned premium base compared to the year ended december  the expense ratio for the year ended december  included a point benefit from a state premium tax refund  point benefit related to the partial settlement of our qualified pension plan liabilities and points of office consolidation costs 
in addition  the expense ratio for the year ended december  included points of expenses related to the decision to cease writing business in houston general and actions taken to better align personal lines staffing with our business needs

the purchase accounting adjustments relating to the onebeacon acquisition were made to reflect the estimated fair value of our assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition 
the purchase accounting adjustments were primarily comprised of an adjustment to our loss and lae reserves and related reinsurance recoverables to record them at fair value  an adjustment to record the cost of our investments at fair value and an allocation of the excess of acquired net assets over the purchase price to our non current  non financial assets  primarily our property  plant and equipment

this practice is often referred to as sub prime mortgage lending 
the slowing us housing market has caused many sub prime mortgage customers to be unable to refinance their mortgage loans  particularly those customers who had adjustable rate mortgages that reset at a higher rate than the rate at the origination of their mortgage 
as a result  there have been significantly higher delinquency and foreclosure rates in the united states 
we purchase commercial and residential mortgage backed securities to maximize our fixed income portfolio s risk adjusted returns and diversify the portfolio risk from primarily corporate credit risk to a mix of credit and cash flow risk 
we are not an originator of residential mortgage loans and did not hold any mortgage backed securities categorized as sub prime as of december  in addition  our investments in limited partnerships  hedge funds and private equity interests contain negligible amounts of sub prime mortgage backed securities as of december  we consider sub prime mortgage backed securities to be those that are issued from dedicated sub prime shelves  dedicated second lien shelves ie  we consider investments backed primarily by second liens to be a sub prime risk regardless of credit score or other metrics or otherwise have underlying loan pools that exhibit weak credit characteristics 
there are also mortgage backed securities that we categorize as non prime also called alt a or a that are backed by collateral that has overall credit quality between prime and sub prime  as determined based on a review of the characteristics of their underlying mortgage loan pools  such as credit scores and financial ratios 
as of december   million of our mortgage backed securities were classified as non prime 
all of these non prime securities have the highest rating ascribed by moody s aaa or standard poor s aaa 
we did not own any collateralized debt obligations  including residential mortgage backed collateralized debt obligations 
our investments in asset backed securities are generally valued using matrix and other pricing models 
key inputs in a typical valuation are benchmark yields  benchmark securities  reported trades  issuer spreads  bids  offers  credit ratings and prepayment speeds 
at december   the market for our investments in asset backed securities remained active and  accordingly  we did not adjust the fair value estimates for the effect of illiquidity

montpelier investment in order to reduce our exposure to certain insurance risks outside of our own underwriting competencies  on august   we exchanged our investment in the common shares of montpelier  a global property catastrophe reinsurer  for an agreed upon portfolio of common equity and fixed maturity securities of equal value that was owned by white mountains

subsequent to the exchange  white mountains sold million common shares of montpelier triggering the recognition of million in realized investment losses in during the second quarter of  we recognized the remaining deferred loss on the exchange of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded an aggregate of million in pre tax investment income from montpelier s regular quarterly dividends 
non gaap financial measures this report includes three non gaap financial measures that have been reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures 
onebeacon believes these measures to be useful supplements to the comparable gaap measures in evaluating onebeacon s financial performance 
in addition  certain of these non gaap financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the impacts of economically defeasing the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
in connection with its initial public offering  the company created two irrevocable grantor trusts and funded them with assets sufficient to make the remaining dividend and redemption payments for million of preferred stock that was redeemed in june and million of preferred stock that was redeemed in may the company created and funded these trusts to appropriately capitalize and leverage the company in preparation for and in connection with its initial public offering 
having completed these actions  onebeacon believes that presentation of certain of the non gaap financial measures as described below  adjusted to exclude the impact of the economic defeasance of the preferred stock as of and for the respective periods  is a useful supplement to understanding the company s earnings and profitability 
adjusted book value per common share is a non gaap financial measure which is derived by excluding the impact of economically defeasing the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock from book value per common share  the most closely comparable gaap measure 
for the reason stated above  onebeacon believes that adjusted book value per common share is a useful supplement to understanding the company s earnings and profitability 
the reconciliation of book value per common share to adjusted book value per common share is included on page adjusted common shareholders equity  which is used in calculating adjusted book value per common share a non gaap financial measure described above  is derived by excluding the impact of economically defeasing the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock from common shareholders equity  the most closely comparable gaap measure 
the reconciliation of common shareholders equity to adjusted common shareholders equity is included on page loss and loss adjustment expense ratio prior to reserve reallocation and total combined ratio prior to reserve reallocation are non gaap financial measures which are derived by excluding the impact of the reallocation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves from the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the gaap combined ratio 
during  onebeacon reallocated loss and loss adjustment expense reserves from ongoing lines of business to run off which reduced the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios and the gaap combined ratios for onebeacon s specialty  commercial and personal lines of business but had no impact on the ratios for onebeacon s total primary insurance operations 
onebeacon believes that a presentation excluding the effect of the reserve reallocation on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios and combined ratios for specialty  commercial and personal lines is a meaningful supplement for investors to understand the performance of its underwriting units 
the reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and gaap combined ratio  the most closely comparable gaap measures  is included on page liquidity and capital resources operating cash and short term investments our sources and uses of cash are as follows holding company level 
the primary sources of cash for onebeacon insurance group  ltd 
and certain of our intermediate holding companies are expected to be dividends and tax sharing payments received from our insurance operating subsidiaries  capital raising activities and net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of holding company investments 
the primary uses of cash are expected to be share repurchases  interest payments on our debt obligations  repurchases of debt  dividend payments on our common shares  purchases of investments  payments made to tax authorities and holding company operating expenses 
operating subsidiary level 
the primary sources of cash for our operating subsidiaries are expected to be premium collections  net investment income  capital raising activities and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
the primary uses of cash are expected to be claim payments  policy acquisition costs  debt obligations  operating expenses  the purchase of investments and dividends and tax sharing payments made to parent holding companies 
insurance companies typically collect premiums on policies that they write prior to paying claims made under those policies 
during periods of premium growth  insurance companies typically experience positive cash flow from operations  as premium receipts typically exceed claim payments 
when this happens  positive cash flow from operations is usually offset by negative cash flow from investing activities  as the positive operating cash flow is used to purchase investments 
conversely  during periods of premium decline  insurance companies typically experience negative cash flow from operations  even during periods in which they report gaap net income  as the claims that they pay exceed the premiums that they collect 
when this happens  negative cash flow from operations is typically offset by positive cash flow from investing activities  as invested assets are sold to fund current claim payments 
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
the exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty 
our operating subsidiaries maintain portfolios of invested assets with varying maturities and a substantial amount of short term investments to provide adequate liquidity for the payment of claims 
management believes that our cash balances  cash flows from operations and cash flows from investments are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future on both a holding company and operating subsidiary level 
credit facility in november  one of our subsidiaries  obh  established a million revolving credit facility that would have matured in november the bank facility 
as of december   the bank facility was undrawn 
the bank facility was terminated in december dividend capacity under the insurance laws of the states and jurisdictions under which our operating subsidiaries are domiciled  an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance regarding the amount of such dividends that may be paid by such subsidiaries in the future 
generally  our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries have the ability to pay dividends during any month period in an amount equal to the greater of prior year statutory net income or of prior year end statutory surplus  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
based on statutory surplus of billion  our top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries have the ability to pay approximately million of dividends during  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
as of december   onebeacon s top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries had billion of unassigned funds 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrestricted net cash and fixed maturity investments outside of our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries 
during  onebeacon s regulated operating subsidiaries paid million of dividends to onebeacon llc 
also  during  onebeacon s unregulated operating subsidiaries declared and paid million of dividends to their immediate parent 
obh s ability to declare or pay dividends was limited by the terms of the series a preferred stock issued to berkshire 
obh could not  in certain circumstances  declare or pay any dividend or distribution to any other class or series of stock without the consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of the berkshire preferred stock 
under the terms of a keep well agreement dated november  between white mountains and obh the keep well  white mountains had agreed to return to obh up to approximately billion if some or all of that amount was required by obh to meet its obligations under the terms of the berkshire preferred stock 
as described below  the keep well has expired 
under the keep well  white mountains had to make any required contributions to obh prior to making any distributions to its shareholders 
the aggregate amount of distributions that white mountains could make to its shareholders was limited  the limit increased or decreased by an amount equal to white mountains consolidated net income or loss over the remaining life of the keep well 
the keep well expired when all obligations of the berkshire preferred stock were satisfied upon its redemption in may see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic defeasance for a discussion of the creation and funding of an irrevocable grantor trust to economically defease the berkshire preferred stock 
economic defeasance in connection with our initial public offering  two of our subsidiaries  obh and obeh  each established an irrevocable grantor trust 
the assets of each trust were solely dedicated to the satisfaction of the payment of dividends and redemption amounts on  respectively  million liquidation preference of obh s berkshire preferred stock  and million liquidation preference of obeh s zenith preferred stock 
obh and obeh funded their respective trusts with cash and purchased a portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by the us government and government sponsored enterprises 
the scheduled interest and principal payments were sufficient to pay when due all amounts required under the terms of the berkshire preferred stock and the zenith preferred stock 
the creation and funding of the trusts did not legally defease the preferred stock nor create any additional rights for the holders of the preferred stock either in the trusts or otherwise  although the assets in the trust were segregated from obh s and obeh s other general assets and were not available to obh or obeh for any use other than the payment of the berkshire preferred stock and the zenith preferred stock  respectively 
assets held in one of the trusts were used to redeem the zenith preferred stock in june  while assets held in the remaining trust were used to redeem the berkshire preferred stock in may white mountains capital  inc  a subsidiary of white mountains  served as the trustee for the irrevocable grantor trusts 
the assets held in the trust as of december  and included and million  respectively  of fixed maturity investments and and million  respectively  of short term investments 
pre tax net investment income earned on these investments totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and insurance float insurance float is an important aspect of our insurance operations 
insurance float represents funds that an insurance company holds for a limited time 
in an insurance operation  float arises because premiums are collected before losses are paid 
this interval can extend over many years 
during that time  the insurer invests the funds 
when the premiums that an insurer collects do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay  the result is an underwriting loss  which is considered to be the cost of insurance float 
the amount and cost of insurance float for us is affected by underlying market conditions  as well as acquisitions or dispositions of insurance business 
although insurance float can be calculated using numbers determined under gaap  insurance float is not a gaap concept and  therefore  there is no comparable gaap measure 
we calculate our insurance float by taking our net invested assets and subtracting our total tangible capital 
the following table illustrates our consolidated insurance float position as of the years ended december  and december  in millions total investments   less total held to maturity investments cash accounts receivable on unsettled investment sales accounts payable on unsettled investment purchases net invested assets   total common shareholders equity   debt preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption total tangible capital   insurance float   insurance float as a multiple of total tangible capital x x net invested assets as a multiple of total tangible capital x x insurance float as a multiple of common shareholders equity x x net invested assets as a multiple of common shareholders equity x x excludes preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption  having an aggregate accredited liquidation preference at december  of million and million of investments held in an irrevocable grantor trust for the purpose of economically defeasing the preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption 
the creation and funding of this trust did not legally defease the preferred stock and therefore the preferred stock appeared on our balance sheet until it was redeemed in may financing the following table summarizes our capital structure as of december  and as of december  in millions senior notes  carrying value other debt total debt preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption total common shareholders equity   total capital   ratio of debt and preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption to total capital ratio of debt to total capital excluding preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption see note debt of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of total capital excludes the preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption because it was economically defeased in connection with our initial public offering 
we believe that we have the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally as needed through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis 
however  given the recent disruptions in the capital markets  we can provide no assurance that  if needed  we would be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms or at all

during the third quarter of  we repurchased million of the outstanding senior notes for million  which resulted in a million gain on extinguishment of debt 
white mountains currently provides an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee as to the payment of principal and interest the guarantee on the senior notes 
in consideration of this guarantee  we have agreed to pay a specified fee to white mountains in the amount of basis points per annum on the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes 
we have further agreed that if white mountains voting interest in us ceases to represent more than of all our voting securities  we will redeem  exchange or otherwise modify the senior notes in order to fully and permanently eliminate white mountains obligations under the guarantee the guarantee elimination 
white mountains has agreed to provide written notice to us when its voting interest in us has been reduced below 
we will have days from the receipt of such notification to complete the guarantee elimination 
if the guarantee elimination is not completed within the initial day period  the guarantee fee shall increase by basis points 
the guarantee fee shall further increase by basis points for each subsequent day period thereafter  up to a maximum guarantee fee of basis points  until the guarantee elimination has been completed 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture which contains restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of white mountains  obh and their respective subsidiaries  which includes us  as a subsidiary of white mountains  to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and substantially limits the ability of obh and its respective subsidiaries to consolidate  merge or transfer their properties and assets 
the indenture does not contain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity to which white mountains or obh must adhere 
at december   obh was in compliance with all of the covenants under the senior notes 
the indenture also contains a cross default provision which provides that if white mountains as guarantor has a payment default in excess of million under a credit agreement  mortgage or similar debt agreement  the default provisions under the indenture to the senior notes will be triggered 
white mountains has a revolving credit facility which provides for borrowing up to a maximum of million and which contains restrictive financial covenants 
as of december   white mountains had drawn million under the facility 
see note related party disclosures of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our december purchase of land and an office building in canton  massachusetts  which is now our us headquarters  we entered into a million  year mortgage note to fund renovations 
as of december   we had fully drawn on the facility 
repayment on the mortgage note commenced in january in november  obh established a million revolving credit facility that would have matured in november as of december   the bank facility was undrawn 
the bank facility was terminated in december off balance sheet arrangement galileo guarantees beginning in february  one of our subsidiaries  obic  agreed to provide guarantees of the obligations of galileo weather risk management ltd 
galileo to galileo s counterparty in certain weather related product transactions 
galileo is a subsidiary of white mountains 
the guarantees required obic to pay the full amount of galileo s obligations to the counterparty in the event that galileo failed to pay these obligations 
in the event of a payment  obic would be eligible to exercise all of the rights of the counterparty against galileo 
in the event that the total guaranteed principal amount exceeded the lesser of of obic s admitted assets of billion at december  or of obic s statutory surplus of billion at december   obic would have required the approval of the pennsylvania department of insurance in order to make any further guarantees 
obic had agreed  at white mountains option  to continue to make these guarantees available through october and received from galileo an annual fee of basis points of the value at risk for providing the guarantees 
pursuant to a separation agreement we entered into with white mountains in connection with the initial public offering  white mountains agreed to take appropriate steps to ensure that obic would not be called on to make payment on these guarantees 
obic assigned its guarantees to white mountains re bermuda  ltd  a subsidiary of white mountains  as of october  therefore  as of december   there were no outstanding guarantees

our loss and lae reserves do not have contractual maturity dates 
however  based on historical payment patterns  the preceding table includes an estimate of when management expects our loss and lae reserves to be paid 
the timing of claim payments is subject to significant uncertainty 
we maintain a portfolio of marketable investments with varying maturities and a substantial amount of short term investments to provide adequate cash flows for the payment of claims 
the balances included in the table above regarding our long term incentive compensation plans include amounts payable for performance shares and units  as well as deferred compensation balances 
exact amounts to be paid cannot be predicted with certainty as the ultimate amounts of these liabilities are based on future performance 
the estimated payments reflected in the table are based on current accrual factors common share price and pay out percentage and assume that all outstanding balances were vested as of december  there are no provisions within our lease agreements that would trigger acceleration of future lease payments 
we do not finance our operations through the securitization of trade receivables  special purpose entities or synthetic leases 
further  we have not entered into any material arrangement requiring us to guarantee payment of third party debt  lease payments or to fund losses of an unconsolidated special purpose entity 
we also have future binding commitments to fund certain limited partnership and hedge fund investments 
these commitments  which total million as of december   do not have fixed funding dates and are therefore excluded from the table above

the consolidated financial statements presented herein include all adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly present our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the historical consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in the current year presentation of financial information  certain amounts in the prior period historical consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
we have completed numerous significant transactions during the periods presented that have affected the comparability of the historical consolidated financial statement information presented herein 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to loss and lae reserves  reinsurance transactions and purchase accounting 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that its critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates used in the preparation of its historical consolidated financial statements 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
fair value considerations on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides a revised definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosure requirements for fair value information 
under sfas  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants an exit price 
the statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources observable inputs and a reporting entity s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy in sfas prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities have the highest priority level  followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices  including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities level and unobservable inputs  including the reporting entity s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use  having the lowest priority level 
effective january   we adopted sfas for our available for sale securities and our investments in limited partnerships  hedge funds and private equity interests 
consistent with the guidance in sfas  in conjunction with the adoption  these securities are now reported as trading securities 
upon adoption  we recorded an adjustment of million to reclassify net unrealized gains  after tax  and net unrealized foreign currency translation gains  after tax  related to investments from accumulated other comprehensive income to opening retained earnings 
subsequent to adoption  we report changes in fair value in revenues before the effect of tax 
we use brokers and outside pricing services to assist in determining fair values 
for investments in active markets  we use the quoted market prices provided by the outside pricing services to determine fair value 
the outside pricing services used by us have indicated that they will only provide prices where observable inputs are available 
in circumstances where quoted market prices are unavailable  we utilize fair value estimates based upon other observable inputs including matrix pricing  benchmark interest rates  market comparables and other relevant inputs 
in circumstances where observable inputs are adjusted to reflect management s best estimate of fair value  such fair value measurements are considered a lower level measurement in the sfas fair value hierarchy 
our process to validate the market prices obtained from the outside pricing sources include  but are not limited to  periodic evaluation of model pricing methodologies and analytical reviews of certain prices 
we also periodically perform back testing of selected sales activity to determine whether there are any significant differences between the market price used to value the security prior to sale and the actual sale price 
for investments in limited partnerships  hedge funds and private equity interests which are included in other investments  net asset value is deemed to approximate fair value 
these investments are not publicly traded and accordingly  quoted market prices are not available 
in circumstances where the secondary market for such investments is not active  our policy is to adjust net asset value to reflect the effect of illiquidity 
where appropriate  the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value would be adjusted for the effect of counterparty credit risk 
as of december   approximately of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon observable inputs 
as of december   other investments represented approximately of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value 
at december   we did not adjust the net asset values used to determine the fair value 
the fair value measurements at december  for assets for which we adopted sfas and any related level inputs are as follows fair value at december  level inputs level percentage in millions fixed maturity investments  common equity securities convertible bonds short term investments other investments total sfas assets  the changes in level fair value measurements for the year ended december  are as follows fixed maturity investments common equity securities convertible bonds other investments total in millions balance at january  total net realized and unrealized gains losses purchases and sales  net transfers in out of level  net balance at december  the majority of the transfers out of level within fixed maturity investments for the year ended december  represent securities for which observable inputs were unavailable as of december  mainly because the securities were relatively new issuances and or limited market data was available 
such securities were manually priced using a combination of market inputs such as benchmark interest rates  market comparables and or broker quotes 
with respect to common equity securities  as a result of efforts to adopt sfas and  we were able to obtain additional information on the underlying common equity securities for a limited partnership that we consolidate in our financial statements 
these common equity securities which are priced based on quoted prices were transferred out of level into level during the year ended december  in addition to the investment portfolio described above  we have million of liabilities recorded at fair value in accordance with sfas and included in other liabilities 
these liabilities relate to securities that have been sold short by a limited partnership that we invest in and we are required to consolidate under generally accepted accounting principles 
all of the liabilities included in the million have been deemed to have a level designation 
loss and lae reserves other than asbestos and environmental reserves and construction defect claim reserves we establish loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
loss and lae reserves are typically comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as ibnr reserves  which include a provision for expected future development on case reserves 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim and are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid loss and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate loss and lae 
actuaries estimate ultimate loss and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ultimate loss and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate loss and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
our own experience  particularly claims development experience  such as trends in case reserves  payments on and closings of claims  as well as changes in business mix and coverage limits  is the most important information for estimating our reserves 
external data  available from organizations such as statistical bureaus  consulting firms and reinsurance companies  is sometimes used to supplement or corroborate our own experience  and can be especially useful for estimating costs of new business 
for some lines of business  such as long tail coverages discussed below  claims data reported in the most recent accident year is often too limited to provide a meaningful basis for analysis due to the typical delay in reporting of claims 
for this type of business  we use a selected loss ratio method for the initial accident year or years 
this is a standard and accepted actuarial reserve estimation method in these circumstances in which the loss ratio is selected based upon information used in pricing policies for that line of business  as well as any publicly available industry data  such as industry pricing  experience and trends  for that line of business 
uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually a few days up to a few months 
the claim tail for liability casualty coverages  such as automobile liability  general liability  products liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  we may adjust our reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is booked in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  should reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
in determining ultimate loss and lae  the cost to indemnify claimants  provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered 
these claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time  such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits  as well as by the particular  unique facts that pertain to each claim 
as a result  the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future 
the factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations 
changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and or development patterns to vary from the past 
a key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate loss and lae  and resulting ibnr reserves  is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected reliably 
because of the factors previously discussed  this process requires the use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
our actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate our loss and lae reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
we place more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made 
these methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories historical paid loss development methods these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical paid loss development methods assume that the ratio of losses paid in one period to losses paid in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use case reserves to estimate ultimate losses  they can be more reliable than the other methods discussed below that look to case reserves such as actuarial methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how case reserves are established by a company s claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged  meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses  than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
historical incurred loss development methods these methods  like historical paid loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
however  instead of using paid losses  these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods can be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses can be less reliable than other methods 
expected loss ratio methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss ratios are typically developed based upon the information used in pricing  and are multiplied by the total amount of premiums written to calculate ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation  the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change  provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes 
we perform an actuarial review of our recorded reserves each quarter 
our actuaries compare the previous quarter s estimates of paid loss and lae  case reserves and ibnr to amounts indicated by actual experience 
differences between previous estimates and actual experience are evaluated to determine whether a given actuarial method for estimating loss and lae should be relied upon to a greater or lesser extent than it had been in the past 
while some variance is expected each quarter due to the inherent uncertainty in loss and lae  persistent or large variances would indicate that prior assumptions and or reliance on certain reserving methods may need to be revised going forward 
in its selection of recorded reserves  our management historically gave greater weight to adjusted paid loss development methods  which are not dependent on the consistency of case reserving practices  over methods that rely on incurred losses 
in recent years  the amount of weight given to methods based on incurred losses has increased with management s confidence that our case reserving practices have been more consistently applied 
upon completion of each quarterly review  our actuaries select indicated reserve levels based on the results of the actuarial methods described previously  which are the primary consideration in determining management s best estimate of required reserves 
however  in making its best estimate  management also considers other qualitative factors that may lead to a difference between held reserves and actuarially recommended levels in the future 
typically  these factors exist when management and our actuaries conclude that there is insufficient historical incurred and paid loss information or that trends included in the historical incurred and paid loss information are unlikely to repeat in the future 
such factors include  among others  recent entry into new markets or new products  improvements in the claims department that are expected to lessen future ultimate loss costs and legal and regulatory developments 
at december  and  total carried reserves were and above the actuarial point estimate  respectively 
construction defect claims reserves construction defect claims are a non a e exposure that has proven to have a greater degree of uncertainty when estimating loss and lae using generally accepted actuarial methods 
our general liability and multiple peril lines of business have been significantly impacted by a large number of construction defect claims 
construction defect is a liability allegation relating to defective work performed in the construction of structures such as apartments  condominiums  single family dwellings or other housing  as well as the sale of defective building materials 
such claims seek recovery due to damage caused by alleged deficient construction techniques or workmanship 
much of the recent claims activity has been generated by plaintiffs lawyers who approach new homeowners  and in many cases homeowner associations with large numbers of homeowners in multi residential complexes  about defects or other flaws in their homes 
claims for construction defects began with claims relating to exposures in california 
then  as plaintiffs lawyers organized suits in other states with high levels of multi residential construction  construction defect claims were reported in nearby western states  such as colorado and nevada  and eventually throughout the country 
the reporting of such claims can be quite delayed as the statute of limitations can be up to ten years 
court decisions have expanded insurers exposure to construction defect claims as well 
for example  in california courts adopted a continuous trigger theory in which all companies that had ever insured a property that was alleged to have been damaged must respond to the claimant  even if evidence of the alleged damage did not appear until after the insurance period had expired 
as a result  construction defect claims may be reported more than ten years after a project has been completed as litigation can proceed for several years before an insurance company is identified as a potential contributor 
claims have also emerged from parties claiming additional insured status on policies issued to other parties eg  such as contractors seeking coverage on a sub contractor s policy 
further  in reserving for these claims  there is additional uncertainty due to the potential for further unfavorable judicial rulings and regulatory actions 
the primary actuarial methods that are used to estimate loss and lae reserves for construction defect claims are frequency and severity methods 
these methods separately project the frequency of future reported claims and the average cost or severity of individual claims 
the reserve is the product of the projected number of reported claims and the severity 
a large number of construction defect claims have been identified relating to coverages that we had written in the past through commercial union corporation and general accident corporation of america  which we refer to as our legacy companies  and their subsidiaries in california  colorado  nevada  washington and oregon 
management has sought to mitigate future construction defect risks in all states by no longer providing insurance to certain residential general contractors and sub contractors involved in multi habitational projects 
mitigating actions also included initiating the withdrawal from problematic sub segments within our construction book of business  such as street and road construction  water  sewer and pipeline construction 
as a result of these actions  management believes that the number of reported construction defect claims relating to coverages written in the past peaked in and will continue to decline 
asbestos and environmental reserves our reserves include provisions made for claims that assert damages from asbestos and environmental  or a e  related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to injuries asserted by those who allegedly came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up cost obligations  particularly as mandated by federal and state environmental protection agencies 
in addition to the factors described above under non asbestos and environmental reserves regarding the reserving process  we estimate our a e reserves based upon  among other factors  facts surrounding reported cases and exposures to claims  such as policy limits and deductibles  current law  past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  as well as analysis of industry studies and events  such as recent settlements and asbestos related bankruptcies 
the cost of administering a e claims  which is an important factor in estimating loss and lae reserves  tends to be higher than in the case of non a e claims due to the higher legal costs typically associated with a e claims 
a large portion of our a e losses resulted from the operations of the employers group  an entity acquired by one of the legacy companies in these operations  including business of employers surplus lines insurance company and employers liability assurance corporation  provided primary and excess liability insurance for commercial insureds  including fortune sized accounts  some of whom subsequently experienced claims for a e losses 
we stopped writing such coverage in our liabilities for a e losses from business underwritten in the recent past are substantially limited by the application of exclusionary clauses in the policy language that eliminated coverage for such claims 
after for pollution and for asbestos  most liability policies contained industry standard absolute exclusions of such claims 
in earlier years  various exclusions were also applied  but the wording of those exclusions was less strict and subsequent court rulings have reduced their effectiveness 
we also incurred a e losses via our participation in industry pools and associations 
the most significant of these pools was excess casualty reinsurance association  or ecra  which provided excess liability reinsurance to us insurers from until the early s 
ecra incurred significant liabilities for a e  of which we bear approximately a share at december  and  or million and million at december  and  respectively  which is fully reflected in our loss and lae reserves 
more recently  since the s  we have experienced an influx of claims from commercial insureds  including many non fortune sized accounts written during the s and s  who are named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits 
as a number of large well known manufacturers of asbestos and asbestos containing products have gone into bankruptcy  plaintiffs have sought recoveries from peripheral defendants  such as installers  transporters or sellers of such products  or from owners of premises on which the plaintiffs exposure to asbestos allegedly occurred 
at december   policyholders had asbestos related claims against us 
in  new insureds with such peripheral involvement presented asbestos claims under prior policies we had written 
historically  most asbestos claims have been asserted as product liability claims 
recently  insureds who have exhausted the available products liability limits of their insurance policies have sought from insurers such as us payment for asbestos claims under the premises and operations coverage of their liability policies  which may not be subject to similar aggregate limits 
we expect this trend to continue 
however  to date there have been fewer of these premises and operations coverage claims than product liability coverage claims 
this may be due to a variety of factors  including that it may be more difficult for underlying plaintiffs to establish losses as stemming from premises and operations exposures  which requires proof of the defendant s negligence  rather than products liability under which strict legal liability applies 
premises and operations claims may vary significantly and policyholders may seek large amounts  although such claims frequently settle for a fraction of the initial alleged amount 
accordingly  there is a great deal of variation in damages awarded for the actual injuries 
as of december   there were approximately active claims by insureds against us without product liability coverage asserting operations or premises coverage  which may not be subject to aggregate limits under the policies 
immediately preceding the onebeacon acquisition  we purchased a reinsurance contract with nico under which we are entitled to recover from nico up to billion in the future for asbestos claims arising from business written by us in and prior  environmental claims arising from business written by us in and prior  and certain other exposures 
under the terms of the nico cover  nico receives the economic benefit of reinsurance recoverables from certain of our third party reinsurers in existence at the time the nico cover was executed  or third party recoverables 
as a result  the third party recoverables serve to protect the billion limit of nico coverage for the benefit of us 
any amounts uncollectible from third party reinsurers due to dispute or the reinsurers financial inability to pay are covered by nico under its agreement with us 
third party recoverables are typically for the amount of loss in excess of a stated level each year 
of claim payments from through  approximately of a e losses have been recovered under the historical third party reinsurance 
in september  we completed a study of our a e exposures 
this study considered  among other items  facts  such as policy limits  deductibles and available third party reinsurance  related to reported claims  current law  past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  industry studies and events  such as recent settlements and asbestos related bankruptcies  and collectibility of third party reinsurance 
based on the study  we increased our best estimate of our incurred losses ceded to nico  net of underlying reinsurance  by million to billion  which is within the billion coverage provided by the nico cover 
the increase in the estimate of incurred a e losses was principally driven by raised projections for claims related to asbestos 
based on the results of the study  we believe that  under all reasonable scenarios  ultimate incurred losses will not exceed the nico cover 
due to the nico cover  there was no impact to income or equity from the change in estimate 
as part of our previously described actuarial review process  we review a e activity each quarter and compare that activity to what was assumed in the most recently completed study 
as of december   we noted no change in the range of reasonable outcomes around our best estimate described above 
as noted above  we have ceded estimated incurred losses of approximately billion to the nico cover at december  since entering into the nico cover  million of the billion of utilized coverage relates to uncollected amounts from third party reinsurers through december  net losses paid totaled billion as of december   with million paid in asbestos payments during reflect payments resulting from intensified efforts by claimants to resolve asbestos claims prior to the potential enactment of us federal asbestos legislation 
to the extent that actual experience differs from our estimate of incurred a e losses and third party recoverables  future losses could exceed the million of protection remaining the nico cover 
our reserves for a e losses  net of third party recoverables but prior to nico recoveries  were billion at december  an industry benchmark of reserve adequacy is the survival ratio  computed as a company s reserves divided by its historical average yearly loss payments 
this ratio indicates approximately how many more years of payments the reserves can support  assuming future yearly payments are equal to historical levels 
our survival ratio was at december  this was computed as the ratio of a e reserves  net of third party recoverables prior to the nico cover of billion plus the remaining unused portion of the nico cover of million  to the average a e loss payments over the three year period ended december   net of third party recoverables 
our survival ratio was at december  we believe that as a result of the nico cover and our historical third party reinsurance programs  we should not experience material financial loss from a e exposures under current coverage interpretations and that our survival ratio compares favorably to industry survival ratios 
however  the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid using recent annual average payments 
many factors  such as aggressive settlement procedures  mix of business and coverage provided  have a significant effect on the amount of a e reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio 
thus  caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio 
our reserves for a e losses at december  represent management s best estimate of its ultimate liability based on information currently available 
however  significant uncertainties  including but not limited to case law developments  medical and clean up cost increases and industry settlement practices  limit our ability to accurately estimate ultimate liability and we may be subject to a e losses beyond currently estimated amounts 
in addition  we remain liable for risks reinsured in the event that a reinsurer does not honor its obligations under reinsurance contracts 
see note reserves for unpaid loss and lae asbestos and environmental loss and lae reserve activity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our a e reserves 
primary insurance operations a e claims activity our a e claims activity  which is all in our primary insurance operations segment  for the last two years is illustrated in the table below year ended december  asbestos accounts with asbestos claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting asbestos claims during the year accounts on which asbestos claims were closed during the year accounts with asbestos claims at the end of the year environmental accounts with environmental claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting environmental claims during the year accounts on which environmental claims were closed during the year accounts with environmental claims at the end of the year total total accounts with a e claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting a e claims during the year accounts on which a e claims were closed during the year total accounts with a e claims at the end of the year primary insurance operations reserve estimation by line of business the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must consider many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
we  like other insurance companies  categorize and track our insurance reserves by line of business  such as automobile liability  multiple peril package business  and workers compensation 
furthermore  we regularly review the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business level  considering the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business 
for loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves  excluding a e  the key assumption as of december  was that the impact of the various reserving factors  as described below  on future paid losses would be similar to the impact of those factors on the historical loss data with the following exceptions recent increases in paid loss trends were inflated due to changes in claim handling procedure that decreased the settlement time for claims 
this resulted in some increases in paid loss activity that we believe will not continue into the future 
increases in case reserve adequacy over the calendar periods have resulted in trends in case incurred activity that we believe will not continue into the future 
case incurred activity can be the result of underlying changes in expected claim costs or changes in the adequacy of the case reserves relative to the underlying expected claim cost 
if the activity is the result of underlying changes in expected costs  it is more likely to repeat in the future  and would likely result in prior year reserve development  as the change in ultimate claim costs would not have been considered when making the previous selection of ibnr reserves 
if the activity is the result of changes in case reserve adequacy  it would not indicate any change in the ultimate claim costs and would not be expected to repeat in the future 
in these cases  it is unlikely that prior year reserve development would occur  as the change in case reserves would be offset by a corresponding change in ibnr reserves ie  deficiency or redundancy in case reserves was implicitly captured when making the previous selection of ibnr reserves 
in  we established a separate claim group to manage run off claims 
due to the nature of this event  we do not believe that the impacts of this group on future losses have been reflected in historical losses 
therefore  we have given considerable weight to the most recent loss experience for this segment 
the major causes of material uncertainty reserving factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
the following section details reserving factors by product line 
there could be other reserving factors that may impact ultimate claim costs 
each reserving factor presented will have a different impact on estimated reserves 
also  reserving factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on estimated reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single reserving factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
workers compensation workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker s life  such as permanent disability benefits and ongoing medical care 
despite the possibility of long payment tails  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker s injury 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated workers compensation reserves include general workers compensation reserving factors mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment or dependents entitled to survivor benefits degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and health insurance changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards indemnity reserving factors time required to recover from the injury degree of available transitional jobs degree of legal involvement changes in the interpretations and processes of various workers compensation bureaus oversight of claims future wage inflation for states that index benefits changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds re marriage rate for spouse in instances of death medical reserving factors changes in the cost of medical treatments  including prescription drugs  and underlying fee schedules frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used type of medical treatments received use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices availability of new medical processes and equipment changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs degree of patient responsiveness to treatment workers compensation book of business reserving factors product mix injury type mix changes in underwriting standards personal automobile liability the personal automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in three components bodily injury liability  property damage liability  and collision comprehensive claims 
this last component has minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and  accordingly  separate factors are not presented 
reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products 
it is generally viewed as a high frequency  low to moderate severity product line 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated personal automobile liability reserves include personal automobile liability reserving factors trends in jury awards changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy changes in case law litigation trends frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits change in average severity of accidents  or proportion of severe accidents subrogation opportunities degree of patient responsiveness to treatment changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards personal automobile liability book of business reserving factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements changes in underwriting standards multiple peril commercial multiple peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the other coverages  generally for the liability coverages  it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses 
multiple peril liability reserves here are generally analyzed as two components bodily injury and property damage 
bodily injury payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder s legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence  subject to the insurance policy provisions 
in some cases the damages can include future wage loss which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation and future medical treatment costs 
property damage payments result from damages to the claimant s private property arising from the policyholder s legal obligation for non intentional acts 
in most cases  property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date  or soon thereafter 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims  though for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim 
multiple peril liability is generally considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided and the jurisdiction  among other factors 
there are numerous components underlying the multiple peril liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within to years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims eg  a reporting lag of a decade for construction defect claims 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated multiple peril liability reserves include multiple peril liability reserving factors changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards changes in policy provisions or court interpretations of such provisions new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue  in general with specificity to particular issues changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts changes in settlement patterns multiple peril liability book of business reserving factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  or jurisdiction mix commercial automobile liability the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in three components  bodily injury liability  property damage liability  and collision comprehensive claims 
this last component has minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and  accordingly  separate reserving factors are not presented 
in general  claim reporting lags are minor  claim complexity is not a major issue  and the line is viewed as high frequency  low to moderate severity 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated commercial automobile liability reserves include bodily injury and property damage liability reserving factors trends in jury awards changes in the underlying court system changes in case law litigation trends frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits change in average severity of accidents  or proportion of severe accidents subrogation opportunities changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used types of medical treatments received changes in cost of medical treatments degree of patient responsiveness to treatment commercial automobile liability book of business reserving factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements changes in mix of insured vehicles eg  long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles  or fleet risks versus non fleet risks changes in underwriting standards general liability see the above discussions under the liability product lines with regard to reserving factors for multiple peril 
homeowners farmowners homeowners farmowners is generally considered a short tail coverage 
most payments are related to the property portion of the policy  where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs  although delays of several months are not unusual 
the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term  although exceptions do exist 
the liability portion of the homeowners farmowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation  but with generally small reporting lags 
overall  the line is generally high frequency  low to moderate severity except for catastrophes  with simple to moderate claim complexity 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated homeowners farmowners reserves include non catastrophe reserving factors salvage opportunities amount of time to return property to residential use changes in weather patterns local building codes litigation trends trends in jury awards catastrophe reserving factors physical concentration of policyholders availability and cost of local contractors local building codes quality of construction of damaged homes amount of time to return property to residential use for the more severe catastrophic events  demand surge inflation  whereby the greatly increased demand for building materials such as plywood far surpasses the immediate supply  leading to short term material increases in building material costs homeowners farmowners book of business reserving factors policy provisions mix eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements degree of concentration of policyholders changes in underwriting standards primary insurance operations loss and lae development loss and lae development in  we experienced million of favorable loss and lae reserve development on prior accident year loss reserves 
the favorable loss reserve development was primarily related to lower than expected severity on non catastrophe losses 
the favorable non catastrophe loss reserve development was primarily related to professional liability in specialty lines and package business in commercial lines partially offset by adverse loss reserve development at autoone and in run off 
specifically  at december   management had revised its expectations downward with respect to future loss emergence in the professional liability business  which is included in the general liability line of business  which had initially been based on market analysis when this business was initiated in and however  during  losses continued to be significantly lower than these revised expectations 
as a result  management lowered its selected reserves on the earliest years which affected more recent years as total loss expectations for those years are based in part on prior years results 
the impact of this revised estimate was a decrease to professional liability reserves of million 
at december   management had estimated that future payments from personal injury protection pip litigation from our nyaip business would be approximately million 
during  the legal expenses related to this litigation were higher than expected as the accident year neared conclusion 
as a result  management increased estimates of all accident years for nyaip and other similar business in new york 
the total increase in estimate was million 
at december   based on actuarial techniques described above  management estimated that ibnr related to multiple peril liability was million  or approximately of case reserves of million for and subsequent accident years 
during  case incurred loss and allocated lae alae was million  which was less than expected for this line of business 
as a result of the lower than expected case incurred loss and alae during  the actuarial methods based on case incurred losses produced lower estimated ultimate losses for these accident years 
as a result  at december   the ibnr was determined to be million  or approximately of the remaining case reserves 
the impact of this revised estimate was a decrease to multiple peril liability reserves of million 
at december   based on actuarial techniques described above  management estimated that ibnr related to workers compensation was million  or approximately of case reserves of million for and subsequent accident years 
during  case incurred loss and alae was million  which was greater than expected for this line of business 
as a result of the higher than expected case incurred loss and alae during  the actuarial methods based on case incurred losses produced higher estimated ultimate losses for these accident years 
as a result  at december   the ibnr was determined to be million  or approximately of the remaining case reserves 
the impact of this revised estimate was an increase to workers compensation reserves of million 
in addition to the development described for the lines of business above  management also recorded a million net decrease in ibnr in other lines of business as a result of its review of loss reserves at december  the change in ibnr for each other line of business was not individually significant 
loss and lae development in  we experienced million of favorable loss reserve development on prior accident year loss reserves 
the favorable loss reserve development was primarily related to lower than expected frequency for professional liability in specialty lines and lower than expected severity for automobile liability in personal lines  partially offset by adverse loss reserve development for multiple peril and workers compensation  primarily for accident years and prior 
specifically  at december   management continued to expect losses to emerge in the professional liability business  which is included in our general liability line of business  in line with initial expectations based on market analysis when this business was initiated in and during  losses continued to be significantly lower than initial expectations 
as a result  management lowered its selected reserves on the earliest years which affected more recent years as total loss expectations for those years are based in part on prior years results 
the impact of this revised estimate was a decrease to professional liability reserves of million 
at december   based on actuarial techniques described above  management estimated that ibnr related to personal automobile liability was million  or approximately of case reserves of million for and subsequent accident years 
during  case incurred loss and alae was million  which was less than expected for this relatively short tail line of business 
at december   based on actuarial techniques described above  management estimated that ibnr was million  or approximately of the remaining case reserves 
the actuarial methods that management relied upon to estimate ibnr at december  were similar to those used at december  the impact of this revised estimate was a decrease to personal automobile liability reserves of million 
at december   based on actuarial techniques described above  management estimated that ibnr related to workers compensation and multiple peril liability was million  or approximately of case reserves of million for and prior accident years 
during  case incurred loss and alae was million  which was greater than expected for these long tail lines of business 
as a result of the higher than expected case incurred loss and alae during  management gave greater weight to actuarial techniques that are based on historical incurred loss development during its review of loss reserves at december  as a result  at december   the ibnr was determined to be million  or approximately relative to the remaining case reserves 
the impact of this revised estimate was an increase to workers compensation and multiple peril liability reserves of million 
in addition to the development described for the lines of business above  management also recorded a million net decrease in ibnr in other lines of business as a result of its review of loss reserves at december  the change in ibnr for each other line of business was not individually significant 
loss and lae development in  we experienced million of adverse loss reserve development on prior accident year loss reserves  primarily due to development on losses related to hurricane events impacting our excess property policies 
specifically at december   management had reviewed all known losses related to hurricane events impacting our excess property policies 
based on information at that time  management established reserves for those losses which were expected to reach our coverage layers 
during  several individual claims experienced adverse development resulting in more losses penetrating our coverage layers 
as a result  management increased held reserves as of december  to reflect the actual adverse claim development as well as a provision for future adverse development on these claims 
primary insurance operations case and ibnr reserves by line of business loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses  by line of business at december  and for our primary insurance operations were as follows december  december  case ibnr total case ibnr total in millions workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total   includes loss and lae reserves related to a e 
includes loss and lae reserves related to construction defect claims 
includes loss and lae reserves related to professional liability 
includes loss and lae reserves related to marine liability 
primary insurance operations range of reserves by line of business our range of reserve estimates at december  was evaluated to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the actuarial methods applied against our historical claims experience data 
the following table shows the recorded reserves and the high and low ends of our range of reasonable loss and lae reserve estimates at december  the high and low ends of our range of reserve estimates in the table below are based on the results of various actuarial methods described above 
december  low recorded high in millions workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total    the recorded reserves represent management s best estimate of unpaid loss and lae by line of business 
we use the results of several different actuarial methods to develop our estimate of ultimate reserves 
while we have not determined the statistical probability of actual ultimate paid losses falling within the range  management believes that it is reasonably likely that actual ultimate paid losses will fall within the ranges noted above because the ranges were developed by using several different generally accepted actuarial methods 
the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by line of business is higher for each line of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all lines taken together due to the effects of diversification 
the diversification effects result from the fact that losses across our different lines of business are not completely correlated 
although management believes our reserves are reasonably stated  ultimate losses may deviate  perhaps materially  from the recorded reserve amounts and could be above the high end of the range of actuarial projections 
this is because ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date  whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that may be unknown as of the valuation date 
the percentages shown in the following table represent the linear interpolation of where our recorded loss and lae reserves are within the range of reserves estimates by line of business at december  and  where the low end of the range equals zero  the middle of the range equals and the high end of the range equals december  expressed as a percentage of the range workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total during  management saw the actuarial methods which were used to develop the range of reserves for certain long tailed lines of business produce lower estimated losses 
however  due to the nature of these lines and the inherent risks in estimating the longer tailed lines of business  management chose to record losses higher in the range for commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and general liability 
additionally in  management began to see higher than anticipated paid loss and lae for personal automobile which has resulted in increases in the methods used to develop the ranges 
however  management believes that the ultimate losses will not increase as much as the models have suggested 
as a result  management has chosen to record reserves lower in the range for personal automobile 
in general  management continues to select somewhat higher in the range for newer and or growing segments and as those reserves have become an increasing proportion of our total reserves  our overall selected reserves have moved up in the range 
sensitivity analysis the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variations from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions 
each of the impacts described below is estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our reserves in total 
it is important to note that the variations discussed are not meant to be a worst case scenario  and therefore  it is possible that future variations may be more than amounts discussed below 
workers compensation recorded reserves for workers compensation were million at december  the two most important assumptions for workers compensation reserves are loss development factors and loss cost trends  particularly medical cost inflation 
loss development patterns are dependent on medical cost inflation 
approximately half of the workers compensation net reserves are related to future medical costs 
across the entire reserve base  a point change in calendar year medical inflation would have changed the estimated net reserve by approximately million at december   in either direction 
personal automobile liability recorded reserves for personal automobile liability were million across all lines at december  personal automobile liability reserves are shorter tailed than other lines of business such as workers compensation and  therefore  less volatile 
however  the size of the reserve base means that future changes in estimates could be material to our results of operations in any given period 
a key assumption for personal automobile liability is the implicit loss cost trend  particularly the severity trend component of loss costs 
a point change in assumed annual severity for the two most recent accident years would have changed the estimated net reserve by million at december   in either direction 
assumed annual severity for accident years prior to the two most recent accident years is likely to have minimal variability 
multiple peril liability and general liability recorded reserves for multiple peril and general liability combined were million at december  reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for these lines of business  particularly for more mature accident years 
historically  assumptions on reported loss development patterns have been impacted by  among other things  emergence of new types of claims eg construction defect claims or a shift in the mixture between smaller  more routine claims and larger  more complex claims 
if the severity trend for construction defect claims changed by points this would have changed the estimated net reserve by million at december   in either direction 
separately  if case reserve adequacy for non construction defect claims changed by points this would have changed the estimated net reserve by million at december   in either direction 
reinsurance transactions our insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to exposure aggregation  to manage their operating leverage ratios and to limit ultimate losses arising from catastrophic events 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in accordance with sfas in connection with the onebeacon acquisition  aviva caused us to purchase reinsurance contracts with two reinsurance companies rated aaa extremely strong  the highest of twenty one ratings by standard poor s and a superior  the highest of fifteen ratings by am best 
one is a reinsurance cover with nico which entitles us to recover up to billion in ultimate loss and lae incurred related to asbestos claims arising from business written by our predecessor prior to  environmental claims arising from business written by our predecessor prior to and certain other latent exposures 
as of december   we have ceded estimated incurred losses of approximately billion to nico under the nico cover 
the other contract is a reinsurance cover with grc for up to million of additional losses on all claims arising from accident years and prior 
as of december   we have ceded estimated incurred losses of million to grc under the grc cover 
the nico cover and grc cover  which were contingent on and occurred contemporaneously with the onebeacon acquisition  were put in place in lieu of a seller guarantee of loss and lae reserves and are therefore accounted for as a seller guarantee under gaap in accordance with eitf topic d nico and grc are wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway 
the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to the solvency and willingness to pay of the reinsurer 
we are selective in choosing our reinsurers  placing reinsurance principally with those reinsurers with a strong financial condition  industry ratings and underwriting ability 
management monitors the financial condition and ratings of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
see note reinsurance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs 
purchase accounting when we acquire another company  our management must estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  as prescribed by sfas no 
 business combinations 
we adopted sfas no 
revised  business combinations effective january  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain assets and liabilities require little judgment to estimate their fair values  particularly those that are quoted on a market exchange  such as publicly traded investment securities 
other assets and liabilities  however  require a substantial amount of judgment to estimate their fair values 
the most significant of these is the estimation required to fair value loss and lae reserves 
we estimate the fair value of loss and lae reserves obtained in an acquisition following the principles contained within fasb statement of financial accounting concepts no 
using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements  or con under con  the fair value of a particular asset or liability essentially contains five elements an estimate of the future cash flows  expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows  the time value of money  represented by the risk free rate of interest  the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset or liability  and other  sometimes unidentifiable  factors including illiquidity and market imperfections 
our actuaries estimate the fair value of loss and lae reserves obtained in an acquisition by taking the acquired company s recorded reserves and discounting them based on expected reserve payout patterns using the current risk free rate of interest 
then  our actuaries develop additional cash flow scenarios that use different payout and ultimate reserve assumptions deemed to be reasonably possible based upon the inherent uncertainties present in determining the amount and timing of payment of such reserves 
in each scenario  the risk free rate of interest is used to discount future cash flows 
these scenarios are put in a statistical model that assigns a probability to each cash flow scenario 
our actuaries then choose the scenario that best represents the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent within the acquired company s recorded reserves 
the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent within the acquired company s reserves is measured as the difference between the selected cash flow scenario and the expected cash flow scenario 
the scenario selected has typically been between and standard deviations from the expected cash flow outcome 
the fair value of the acquired company s loss and lae reserves is determined to be the sum of the expected cash flow scenario ie  the acquired company s discounted loss and lae reserves and the uncertainty price 
the difference between an acquired company s loss and lae reserves and our best estimate of the fair value of such reserves at the acquisition date is amortized ratably over the payout period of the acquired loss and lae reserves 
historically  the fair value of an acquired company s loss and lae reserves has been less than its nominal reserves at acquisition 
accordingly  the amortization has been and will continue to be recorded as an expense on our income statement until fully amortized 
in connection with purchase accounting for the onebeacon acquisition  we were required to adjust to fair value our loss and lae reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables by million and million  respectively  on onebeacon s acquired balance sheet as of june  this net reduction to loss and lae reserves of million is being accreted through an income statement charge ratably with and over the period the claims are settled

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market rates and prices 
due to our sizable balances of interest rate sensitive instruments  market risk can have a significant effect on onebeacon s consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk fixed maturity and convertible bond portfolios 
in connection with our consolidated insurance subsidiaries  we invest in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
our strategy is to purchase fixed maturity investments and convertible bonds that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
upon adoption of sfas on january   our portfolio of fixed maturity investments held for general investment purposes were reclassified as trading securities which are reported at fair value as of the balance sheet date as determined by quoted market prices when available 
realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on trading securities are reported pre tax in revenues 
prior to adoption of sfas  our fixed maturity investments were held as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or sfas  whereby these investments were carried at fair value on the balance sheet with net unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax as a separate component of common shareholders equity 
upon adoption of sfas  our convertible bonds are carried at fair value with changes therein recorded in revenues as unrealized investment gains or losses 
prior to adoption of sfas  our convertible bonds were held as available for sale and were carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through income as realized investment gains or losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments  or sfas we generally manage our interest rate risk associated with our portfolio of fixed maturity investments and convertible bonds by monitoring the average duration of the portfolio  which allows us to achieve an adequate yield without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
our fixed maturity and convertible bond portfolios are comprised of primarily investment grade corporate securities  us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities eg  those receiving an investment grade rating from standard poor s or moody s 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity and convertible bond investments  respectively 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in market interest rates on our fixed maturity and convertible bond investments and pension fixed maturity investments fair value at december  assumed change in relevant interest rate estimated fair value after change in interest rate after tax increase decrease in carrying value in millions fixed maturity and convertible bond investments  bp decrease  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  pension fixed maturity investments bp decrease bp decrease bp increase bp increase long term obligations 
as of december   our interest and dividend bearing long term obligations consisted primarily of the senior notes which have a fixed interest rate 
as a result  our exposure to interest rate risk resulting from variable interest rate obligations is insignificant 
the senior notes were issued in and mature on may  at december   the fair value of the senior notes was million  which compared to a carrying value of million 
the fair value of this obligation was estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market rates for similar obligations or using quoted market prices 
mortgage note on real estate owned 
in connection with our purchase of land and an office building in that became our us headquarters in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a million  year mortgage note which has a variable interest rate based upon the lender s day libor rate 
as of december   we had fully drawn on the mortgage note 
repayment commenced in january cash flow hedge 
concurrent with entering into the mortgage note in  we also entered into an interest rate swap to hedge our exposure to the variability in the interest rate on the mortgage note 
the notional amount of the swap is equal to the debt outstanding on the mortgage note and will be adjusted to match the drawdowns and repayments on the mortgage note so that the principal amount of the mortgage note and the notional amount of the swap are equal at all times 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed interest rate of approximately and receive a variable interest rate based on the same libor index used for the mortgage note 
interest paid or received on the swap is reported in interest expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  we have accounted for the swap as a cash flow hedge and have recorded the interest rate swap at fair value on the balance sheet in other assets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap  which was a million loss  after tax  for the year ended december   is reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
we monitor continued effectiveness of the hedge by monitoring the changes in the terms of the instruments as described above as compared to the actual changes in principal and notional amount in the mortgage note and interest rate swap  respectively 
credit spread risk fixed maturity and convertible bond portfolios 
our overall fixed maturity investment strategy is to purchase securities that are attractively priced in relation to credit risks 
widening and tightening of credit spreads generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments  respectively 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical widening and tightening of credit spreads on our fixed maturity and convertible bond investments and pension plan fixed maturity investments 
fair value at december  assumed change in credit spread estimated fair value after change in credit spread after tax increase decrease in carrying value in millions fixed maturity and convertible bond investments  bp decrease  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  pension fixed maturity investments bp decrease bp decrease bp increase bp increase equity price risk the carrying values of our common equity securities and our other investments are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value which is based  in part  on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices of common equity securities  in general  are subject to fluctuations which could cause the amount to be realized upon sale or exercise of the instruments to differ significantly from the current reported value 
the fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments  general market conditions and supply and demand imbalances for a particular security 
foreign currency exchange rates our investments denominated in foreign currencies are valued using period end exchange rates and our net investment income on foreign denominated securities are valued using average exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur losses on a us dollar basis due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we held million in bonds denominated in foreign currencies  mostly in british pounds and australian dollars 
assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in the rate of exchange from the british pound and australian dollar to the us dollar as of december   the carrying value of our foreign currency denominated bond portfolio would have respectively decreased or increased by million
