the corporation s products are sold under such well known brands as kleenex  scott  huggies  pull ups  kotex and depend 
the corporation has four reportable global business segments personal care  consumer tissue  k c professional other  and health care 
these global business segments are described in greater detail in item  note to the consolidated financial statements 
in managing its global business  the corporation s management believes that developing new and improved products  responding effectively to competitive challenges  obtaining and maintaining leading market shares  controlling costs  and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long term success of the corporation 
the discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors 
product innovation past results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation 
the corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and or maintain category leadership 
in order to introduce new or improved products  the technology to support those products must be acquired or developed 
research and development expenditures are directed towards new or improved personal care  tissue  industrial wipers  safety and health care products and nonwoven materials 
competitive environment past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets  both domestically and internationally 
our products compete with widely advertised  well known  branded products  as well as private label products  which are typically sold at lower prices 
we have several major competitors in most of our markets  some of which 
table of contents part ii continued are larger and more diversified 
the principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty  product innovation  quality and performance  price  and marketing and distribution capabilities 
the corporation increased promotional and strategic marketing spending in and to support new product introductions  further build brand equity and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the corporation s products in the market 
we expect competition to continue to be intense in market shares achieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance 
we hold number or share positions in more than countries 
achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands 
cost controls to maintain or improve our competitive position  we must control our manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
we have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in our business segments 
our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of pulp  oil and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes 
our strategic investments in information systems and partnering with third party providers of administrative services should also allow further cost savings through streamlining administrative activities 
foreign currency and commodity risks as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we are also exposed to changes in commodity prices 
our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations 
global economic environment the corporation s business and financial results continue to be adversely affected by recessions in the united states and throughout the world and volatility in the global financial markets 
although it has become more challenging to predict our results in the near term  we will continue to focus on executing our global business plan strategies for the long term health of our businesses

unfavorable currency effects in south korea were offset by favorable effects in other countries  primarily in brazil and israel 
consumer tissue net sales in north america were even with the prior year as increased net selling prices of more than percent and improved product mix of nearly percent were offset by a sales volume decline of about percent 
the higher net selling prices were primarily attributable to price increases for bathroom tissue and paper towels implemented during the first and third quarters in the us list prices for facial tissue were raised late in the third quarter 
sales volumes were down mid single digits in bathroom tissue and facial tissue and double digits in paper towels  primarily as a result of the corporation s focus on improving revenue realization 
a portion of the overall volume decline is also due to the corporation s decision in late to shed certain low margin private label business 
in europe  consumer tissue net sales increased almost percent on nearly percent higher net selling prices  a percent improvement in product mix and more than percent favorable currency effects  tempered by a decline in sales volumes of about percent 
the lower sales volumes were primarily due to reduced sales of andrex and scottex bathroom tissue and kleenex facial tissue in response to higher net selling prices and a slowdown in category sales  particularly in the uk consumer tissue net sales in the developing and emerging markets increased nearly percent 
during  the corporation raised prices in most markets to recover higher raw materials costs and drove improvements in mix with more differentiated  value added products  strategies that resulted in higher net selling prices of about percent and better product mix of more than percent 
sales volumes were even with last year 
for the year  currency effects were neutral as favorable effects earlier in the year were offset by the dramatic changes in currency rates in the fourth quarter of economic weakness and rising unemployment levels in north america and europe began to affect k c professional s categories in the fourth quarter of for the year  net sales in north america increased nearly percent as increased net selling prices of about percent and improved product mix of over percent were tempered by lower sales volumes 
in europe  net sales of kcp products advanced about percent as increased net selling prices and higher sales volumes contributed nearly percent and percent  respectively  to the improvement 
currency effects were about percent favorable versus the prior year 
the increased sales volumes for health care products were primarily due to mid single digit growth outside north america and a similar advance for medical devices in north america

table of contents part ii continued commentary versus percent change in net sales versus prior year total change changes due to volume net price currency mix other consolidated personal care consumer tissue k c professional other health care in north america  net sales of personal care products increased nearly percent primarily on the strength of increased sales volumes 
product innovations spurred volume growth  with a double digit gain for huggies baby wipes  high single digit growth for huggies diapers and mid single digit increases for the corporation s child care and incontinence care brands 
child care sales volumes benefited from the late third quarter introduction of goodnites sleep boxers and sleep shorts  a unique offering in the youth pants category 
meanwhile  sales volumes of kotex feminine care products were below year ago levels 
net selling prices increased about percent 
net sales of personal care products in europe increased about percent  principally due to favorable currency effects 
higher sales volumes of more than percent were offset by lower net selling prices 
the sales volume gains reflect higher sales of huggies diapers and baby wipes across the region  including a more than percent volume gain for huggies diapers in the four core markets united kingdom  france  italy and spain

improved product mix was negated by an overall sales volume decline of about percent that resulted from the corporation s decision to shed low margin business following the sale or closure of certain facilities in the region 
sales volume increases for andrex bathroom tissue and kleenex facial tissue were not sufficient to offset the withdrawal from the low margin business 
net selling prices remained about the same as in the prior year

the decrease in sales volumes of health care products was mainly attributable to a higher level of sales of face masks in primarily due to avian flu preparedness and the impact of the corporation s decision in the second half of to exit the latex exam glove business

sales of exam gloves improved sequentially in the fourth quarter of versus the third quarter levels 
nevertheless  the growth in sales of nitrile gloves did not compensate for the drop off in sales of latex gloves  due in part to supply constraints earlier in and competitive market conditions 
in other areas of the business  sales of medical devices  particularly ballard respiratory catheters  generated high single digit improvement
