today  five companies form the core of allied motion 
the companies  emoteq  computer optical products  motor products  stature electric and premotec offer a wide range of standard motors  encoders and drives for original equipment manufacturers oem and end user applications 
a particular strength of each company is its ability to design and manufacture custom motion control solutions to meet the needs of its customers 
the company has made considerable progress in implementing its corporate strategy  with the driving force of electro magnetic  mechanical and motion technology know how 
the company s commitment to allied s systematic tools  or ast for short  is driving continuous improvement in quality  delivery  cost and growth

outlook allied motion had a good year in despite the devastating fire that occurred at our chatsworth  ca plant in october and the fall off of our business in the fourth quarter caused by the global economic downturn 
in response to the economic downturn  we have and will continue to take 
table of contents actions to mitigate its adverse effects including reductions in costs and expenses 
while we cannot predict how long the current worldwide economic slowdown will last or how severely it will impact us and our customers  we will continue to monitor market conditions and allocate resources appropriately to meet our current needs and prepare for growth 
the company has a strong balance sheet  with a cash position that exceeds outstanding debt 
while we will continue to make necessary adjustments  we have not cut our resources in electro magnetic  mechanical and electronic design capabilities to provide solutions that raise the bar with our customers and provide important differentiating factors against our competition 
our broad market diversification provides an opportunity to grow some markets even while some are flat or experiencing decline 
as certain markets are more recession proof than others  we will continue to make investments in the markets we believe to be less affected in a recession than others 
one of the company s major challenges is to maintain and improve price competitiveness 
the company s customers are continually being challenged by their markets and competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible 
currently  the company is producing some of its motor sub assemblies and finished products at sub contract manufacturing facilities in china and slovakia 
the company will continue to identify opportunities where production in low cost regions can improve profitability while delivering the same high quality products 
the company s products contain certain metals  and the company experiences fluctuations in the costs of these metals  particularly copper  steel and zinc  which are all key materials in our products 
the company has reacted by aggressively sourcing material at lower costs from asian markets and by passing on surcharges and price increases to our customers 
the company continues to pursue aggressive motor and drive development plans for new products that leverage the combined technology base of the allied motion companies 
the company focuses on new product designs that design out cost  provide higher level  value added performance solutions and meet the needs of our served markets 
over the last few years  the company announced several new motor designs targeted at various markets 
it normally takes twelve months to get new products designed into new customer applications 
the company is moving forward with a one team sales force to more effectively leverage resources utilizing a company wide sales organization 
with the one team sales force selling all the company s products  our expectation is that this capability provides opportunities to increase sales from existing customers and secure new business opportunities 
management believes the strategy we have developed for the company will accomplish our long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability
