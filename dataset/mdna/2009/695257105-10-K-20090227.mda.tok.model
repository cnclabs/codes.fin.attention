we acquired of the stock of prairie packaging  inc prairie on june  the results of prairie s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of that date 
in january  we purchased an additional interest in a folding carton operation in dongguan  china 
this brought our interest to  requiring us to include the joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
on october   we sold substantially all of our protective and flexible packaging businesses 
the results of the sold businesses  as well as costs and charges associated with the transaction  are classified as discontinued operations 
we have three reporting segments consumer products manufactures disposable plastic  foam  molded fiber  pressed paperboard  and aluminum packaging products  and sells them to customers such as grocery stores  mass merchandisers  and discount chains

customers include foodservice distributors  restaurants  other institutional foodservice outlets  food processors  and grocery chains 
other includes corporate and administrative service operations and retiree benefit income and expense 
the accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those for pactiv as a whole 
where discrete financial information is not available by segment  reasonable allocations of income  expenses  assets  and liabilities are used

table of contents significant trends  opportunities  and challenges risks several opportunities and challenges may influence our continued growth 
near term risks include the impact of raw material cost volatility the ability to maintain or increase selling prices the continued effectiveness of our productivity and procurement initiatives economic and financial market conditions longer term risks include potential changes in consumer demand or governmental regulations possible supplier and customer consolidations potential increases in foreign based competition possible growth in market share of unbranded products we expect to continue to be successful by adjusting selling prices to offset resin price movements implementing aggressive cost management and productivity programs leveraging our existing products into new distribution channels introducing innovative new products making strategic acquisitions raw materials and energy related costs the primary raw materials used to manufacture our products are plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene 
average industry prices for polystyrene and polyethylene as published by chemical market associates  inc are depicted in the following graphs 
polystyrene cents lb 
polyethylene cents lb 
line graph line graph over time  we have been able to raise selling prices in many areas of our business to offset the dollar effect of resin cost increases  although there usually is a lag of several months 
we continue to closely monitor the resin marketplace 
as oil prices have fallen from their historic highs  we have seen a reduction in resin costs  which has had a favorable impact on spread the difference between selling prices and raw material costs 
however  the extent and duration of the resin cost reduction and resulting spread improvement is uncertain 
our business is sensitive to other energy related cost movements  particularly those that affect transportation and utility costs 
historically  we have been able to mitigate the effect of higher energy related costs with productivity improvements and other cost reductions 
as energy costs have declined  we have seen a favorable impact on our margins 
however  the extent and duration of energy related cost reductions is uncertain 
demand due to the current economic downturn and lower consumer confidence  the markets for our packaging products are experiencing weak demand 
this trend is expected to continue for most  if not all  of while 
table of contents our businesses have performed well in this difficult environment  demand will be difficult to predict 
we monitor and adjust our production and procurement levels accordingly 
productivity improvements in  we began to introduce lean principles and tools in many of our operating facilities 
we are expanding the use of lean principles to help us accelerate productivity improvements by reducing inventory and scrap levels  providing rapid stock replenishment  shortening scheduling cycles  improving our one stop shopping service  eliminating nonvalue added activities  and streamlining processes 
as this is a long term process  we expect our ability to use these tools throughout the organization will have a positive affect on our operating results in future years 
pension worldwide stock markets declined significantly in and  as a result  our us pension plan was substantially underfunded at december  see the liquidity and shareholders equity sections for further discussion of the impact on the company of this underfunding 
restructuring in  we implemented a cost reduction program that included the consolidation of two small facilities  asset rationalizations  and headcount reductions 
in  we recorded a charge of approximately million after tax or per share 
cash payments related to restructuring and other charges were million for the year ended december  the program is essentially complete with the exception of a small plant held for sale 
results of continuing operations the acquisition of prairie positively impacted our overall sales  volume  and operating income 
however  due to the integration of prairie into our other businesses  we are unable to quantify the precise dollar effect on our overall results 
year compared with sales increase decrease in millions amount percent consumer products foodservice food packaging total sales grew  reflecting volume growth primarily from the inclusion of acquisition sales  an increase in net pricing of million  and foreign currency exchange gains of million 
the increase in sales for consumer products reflected volume improvement of primarily from the inclusion of acquisition sales  and an increase in net pricing of million 
sales growth of for foodservice food packaging was attributable to a volume gain of principally a result of the inclusion of acquisition sales  favorable pricing of million and foreign currency exchange gains of million 

table of contents operating income increase decrease in millions amount percent consumer products foodservice food packaging other total operating income declined as favorable volume of million and lower advertising and promotional a p costs of million were more than offset by higher operating costs of million  restructuring charges of million  acquisition related depreciation and amortization of million  and unfavorable spread of million 
the higher operating costs were driven primarily by the impact of higher energy costs on utilities and freight costs 
the following table shows the impact of restructuring and other charges on operating income by segment 
operating income twelve months ended december  gaap restructuring and excluding restructuring in millions basis other and other consumer products foodservice food packaging other total we believe that focusing on operating income excluding the effect of restructuring and other charges is a meaningful alternative way of evaluating our operating results 
the restructuring and other charges relate to actions that will have an ongoing effect on our company 
considering such charges as being only applicable to the periods in which they are recognized could make our operating performance in those periods more difficult to evaluate relative to other periods in which there are no such charges 
we use operating income excluding restructuring and other charges to evaluate operating performance and  along with other factors  in determining management compensation 
the following table shows operating income excluding restructuring and other charges for and increase decrease in millions amount percent consumer products foodservice food packaging other total the decline in operating income for the consumer products business was driven principally by unfavorable spread of million and higher operating costs of million  offset partially by higher volume of million and lower a p costs of million 
operating income for the foodservice food packaging business was essentially flat  reflecting higher volume of million and favorable spread of million  offset by higher operating costs of million  acquisition related depreciation and amortization of million  higher selling  general  and administrative sg a expense of million  and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of million 
the increase in operating costs was driven primarily by higher utility and freight costs 
the increase in operating income for the other segment primarily reflects lower legal related expenses 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate for was  compared with for income from continuing operations we recorded income from continuing operations of million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in the decline was driven primarily by lower operating income of million including restructuring of million after tax as described previously  and higher interest costs of million after tax related to the financing of the prairie acquisition 
discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations in  we recorded expense from discontinued operations of million  which was attributed to taxes associated with business dispositions which occurred in prior years 
in  we recorded income from discontinued operations of million  which was related to final working capital adjustments and taxes associated with business dispositions 
liabilities related to discontinued operations  which included obligations related to income taxes and certain royalty payments were as follows at december in millions current liabilities noncurrent liabilities total liabilities related to discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources capitalization increase at december in millions decrease short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt long term debt total debt minority interest shareholders equity total capitalization ratio of total debt to total capitalization shareholders equity decreased million in as detailed below

measurement provision  net of tax of million stock repurchases net income stock based compensation and common stock issued in connection with stock option exercises shareholders equity at december  
table of contents we have completed our pension plan measurements at december   for accounting purposes 
as a result of the substantial decline in the fair market value of pension plan assets at december   the funded status of our us qualified plan has decreased 
during  we recorded noncash charges of million to accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity to reflect the change in funded status 
cash flows cash flows for continuing and discontinued operations were as follows increase in millions decrease cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally a result of changes in amounts drawn under our asset securitization facility 
borrowings under our asset securitization facility increased by million in compared with an increase of million in cash used by investing activities in was driven by amounts spent on capital expenditures to support growth in cups and cutlery 
cash used by investing activities in primarily reflected amounts spent on the acquisition of prairie of billion and plant and equipment of million 
cash used by financing activities in was driven by the repayment of debt of million 
cash provided by financing activities in was driven by the issuance of debt of million and common stock of million and the cash tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  offset partially by the repayment of debt of million  as well as the repurchase of company stock of million 
capital commitments commitments for authorized capital expenditures totaled approximately million at december  it is anticipated that the majority of these expenditures will be funded over the next months from existing cash and short term investments and internally generated cash 
contractual obligations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under long term contracts 
our long term contractual obligations at december   were as follows due in less than more than in millions total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total includes fixed rate notes  plus related interest payment obligations  based on rates in effect at december  includes open capital commitments  amounts related to the purchase of minimum quantities of raw materials at current market prices under supply agreements and other long term vendor agreements with specific payment provisions and early termination penalties 

table of contents includes undiscounted workers compensation obligations  and undiscounted and unfunded postretirement medical and supplemental pension funding requirements 
liquidity and off balance sheet financing we use various sources of funding to manage liquidity 
sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations and a year revolving credit facility of million  under which million was outstanding at december  we were in full compliance with the financial and other covenants of our revolving credit agreement at the end of the period 
the two financial covenant ratios contained in our debt agreements are an interest coverage ratio and the total debt to ebitda ratio 
the interest coverage ratio is defined as consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by interest expense 
the minimum required ratio is to the total debt to ebitda ratio is calculated by dividing the total debt by ebitda 
the maximum permitted total debt to ebitda ratio is to the interest coverage ratio and the debt to ebitda ratio are shown in the following table 
twelve months ended in millions december  net income adjustments noncash restructuring and other interest expense  net of interest capitalized income tax expense depreciation and amortization minority interest ebitda ebitda interest expense  net of interest capitalized interest coverage ratio total debt ebitda total debt to ebitda ratio amounts per the consolidated statement of income 
amounts per the consolidated statement of cash flows 
amounts per the consolidated statement of financial position 
there have been no stated events of default  which would permit the lenders to accelerate the debt if not cured within applicable grace periods  or any cross default provisions in our debt agreements 
we also use an asset securitization facility as a form of off balance sheet financing 
at december   million was securitized under this facility  and million was securitized at december  we do not participate in financial commercial paper markets 
on april   we repaid million of notes due on that date using proceeds from our asset securitization facility million and cash on hand 
we have a us qualified pension plan that covers approximately  of our employees  as well as approximately  others  mostly retirees and persons who worked for predecessor companies that were part of tenneco 
the requirement to make contributions to this plan is a function of several factors  the most important of which are the return on plan assets and applicable funding discount rate used in calculating plan liabilities 
we are not required to make a contribution to this plan in  however  under all likely scenarios  
table of contents we will be required to make a significant contribution to the plan in therefore  we have elected to make a contribution to the plan in to lessen the contribution required in the future 
we contributed million approximately million after tax in february  and expect to contribute an additional million approximately million after tax later in assuming that we make a total contribution of million million after tax  if the plan assets earn an actual rate of return in equal to our expected long term rate of return of and the pension funding discount rate as of january  is  unchanged from the rate as of january   we estimate a minimum required cash contribution in to the us pension plan on an after tax basis of approximately million 
holding the pension funding discount rate constant  each one percentage point increase decrease in the annual actual rate of return up to would reduce increase the minimum cash contribution on an after tax basis by approximately million 
on the same basis  each one percentage point increase in the actual rate of return above would reduce the minimum required after tax cash contribution by approximately million 
holding the actual rate of return constant  each one half percentage point increase decrease in the pension funding discount rate would reduce increase the minimum required after tax cash contribution by approximately million 
we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash reserves  and the ability to obtain cash under our credit facility and asset securitization program will be sufficient to meet current and future potential pension funding  liquidity  and capital requirements 
year compared with sales increase decrease in millions amount percent consumer products foodservice food packaging total sales grew 
excluding the impact of the prairie acquisition of million  sales grew  reflecting higher volume of million  higher selling prices of million  and foreign currency exchange gains of million 
sales for consumer products rose  reflecting volume growth from the inclusion of million of sales from the prairie acquisition  and a increase in both volume and price in the base business 
sales growth of for foodservice food packaging was attributable to a volume gain from the inclusion of million of sales from the prairie acquisition  as well as volume growth in the base business of million  and foreign currency exchange gains of million 
operating income increase decrease in millions amount percent consumer products foodservice food packaging other total the improvement in operating income was driven primarily by volume growth of million  principally from the prairie acquisition  and lower performance related compensation of million and a p expenses of million  offset partially by a million decline in spread  resulting from higher raw material costs 

table of contents the increase in operating income for consumer products was driven mainly by volume growth of million  primarily from the prairie acquisition  and lower a p expenses of million  offset partially by higher operating costs of million 
the increase in operating income for the foodservice food packaging business was due to volume growth of million  primarily related to the prairie acquisition  and lower sg a expenses of million  offset  in part  by unfavorable spread of million resulting from higher raw material costs 
the increase in operating income for the other segment was driven primarily by lower performance related compensation 
income taxes our effective tax rate for was  compared with for the lower tax rate was driven principally by a reduction in accrued income taxes due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for prior tax years  offset partially by other accruals for income tax liabilities 
income from continuing operations we recorded income from continuing operations of million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in the decline primarily reflects the nonrecurrence in of amounts booked in to recognize a realized foreign currency exchange gain upon the liquidation of our european treasury operation of million after tax  and to record favorable income tax liability adjustments of million after tax  and higher interest costs of million after tax in  partially offset by higher operating income of million after tax in discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations we recorded income from discontinued operations of million in and million in which was related to final working capital adjustments and taxes related to business dispositions

critical accounting policies following are our accounting policies that involve the exercise of considerable judgment and the use of estimates 
these have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to customers  which generally occurs as products are shipped 
in arriving at net sales  we estimate the amount of deductions from sales that are likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs 
these include volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon offerings 
estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
in addition  we pay slotting fees and participate in cooperative advertising programs 
our accounting policy for all these programs is to deduct the expenses from revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales may increase or decrease by a material amount 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of inventories at december   and at december  is valued using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
products which are made and sold in the us and use polystyrene  polyethylene  amorphous polypropylene terephthalate  or paper as their principal raw material utilize the lifo method of inventory accounting 
similar products which are produced and sold outside of the us use the first in  first out fifo or the average cost method of inventory accounting because the lifo valuation method is not permitted in those countries in which we operate 
worldwide  we use the fifo accounting method for production supplies and products made from aluminum and polypropylene 
we periodically review inventory balances to identify slow moving and or obsolete items 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including new product introductions  changes in consumer demand patterns  and historical usage trends 
pension plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
see changes in accounting principles in the notes to the financial statements for additional information 
total pretax pension plan income was million in  million in  and million in  and represented the net pension income  which is recorded as an offset to sg a expenses  and our production operations pension service costs  which are recorded in cost of sales 
we estimate that our noncash pretax pension income will decrease to million in projections of pension income are based on a number of factors  including estimates of future returns on pension plan assets  estimates of discount rates  assumptions pertaining to the amortization of actuarial gains losses  expectations regarding employee compensation  and assumptions related to participant turnover  retirement age  and life expectancy 

table of contents in developing our assumption regarding the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we estimate future returns on various classes of assets  risk free rates of return  and long term inflation rates 
since  our us qualified pension plan s annual rate of return on assets has averaged 
historically  the plan has invested approximately of its assets in equity securities and in fixed income investments 
after considering all of these factors  we concluded that the use of a rate of return was appropriate for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the rate of return assumption would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption for our us pension plan is based on the composite yield of a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds constructed with durations to match the plan s future benefit obligations 
in this connection  the discount rate assumption for our us plan at our december  measurement date was and at our september   measurement date 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the discount rate would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million

all statements other than statements of historical fact  including statements regarding prospects and future results  are forward looking 
these forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of terms and phrases such as will  believe  anticipate  may  might  could  expect  estimated  projects  intends  foreseeable future  and similar terms and phrases 
these forward looking statements are not based on historical facts  but rather on our current expectations or projections about future events

while we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable and make the statements in good faith  actual results almost always vary from expected results  and differences could be material 
in the risk factors section item a  we have attempted to list some of the factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these factors include the following changes in consumer demand and selling prices for our products  including new products that our competitors or we may introduce that could impact sales and margins 
material substitutions and changes in costs of raw materials  including plastic resins  labor  utilities  or transportation that could impact our expenses and margins

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
to manage these risks we may enter into various hedging contracts in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use hedging instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any transactions involving leveraged derivatives 
commodity derivatives during the fourth quarter of  we entered into natural gas purchase agreements with third parties  hedging a portion of the first half of purchases of natural gas used in the production processes at certain of our plants 
these purchase agreements are marked to market  with the resulting gains or losses recognized in earnings when hedged transactions are recorded 
the mark to market adjustments at december   were immaterial 
interest rates at december   we had public debt securities of billion outstanding  with fixed interest rates and maturities ranging from to years 
should we decide to redeem these securities prior to their stated maturity  we would incur costs based on the fair value of the securities at that time 
in addition  we have a revolving line of credit  against which we borrowed million at december  the fair value of the debt at that date was equal to the outstanding balance 
as a part of the acquisition of prairie packaging inc prairie  we assumed prairie s liability for million borrowed from the illinois development finance authority idfa  which were funded by industrial development revenue bonds issued by the idfa 
the debt matures on december   and bears interest at varying rates as of december  not to exceed per annum 
the following table provides information about pactiv s financial instruments that are sensitive to interest rate risks 
maturities in millions  except percentages thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate fair value floating rate debt average interest rate fair value prior to our spin off from tenneco  we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements 
we settled this swap in november  incurring a million loss  which is being recognized as additional interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
in april  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk related to million of the debt expected to be issued in connection with the acquisition of prairie 
we entered into these swap agreements to moderate the risk of interest rate changes during the period from the date the agreement to acquire prairie was signed to the date the notes used to finance the acquisition were issued 
the swap agreements were terminated on june   resulting in a gain of million 
this gain is being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the average life of the underlying debt 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the risk of interest rate volatility on million of amounts due under our revolving credit facility 
this agreement terminated on december
