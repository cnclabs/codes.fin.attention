item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general houston american energy was incorporated in april for the purposes of seeking oil and gas exploration and development prospects 
since inception  we have sought out prospects utilizing the expertise and business contacts of john f 
terwilliger  our founder and principal executive officer 
through the third quarter of  the acquisition targets were in the gulf coast region of texas and louisiana  where mr 
terwilliger has been involved in oil and gas exploration for over years 
in the fourth quarter  we initiated international efforts through a colombian joint venture more fully described below 
domestically and internationally  the strategy is to be a non operating partner with exploration and production companies that have much larger resources and operations 
overview of operations our operations are exclusively devoted to natural gas and oil exploration and production 
our focus  to date and for the foreseeable future  is the identification of oil and gas drilling prospects and participation in the drilling and production of prospects 
we typically identify prospects and assemble various drilling partners to participate in  and fund  drilling activities 
we may retain an interest in a prospect for our services in identifying and assembling prospects without any contribution on our part to drilling and completion costs or we may contribute to drilling and completion costs based on our proportionate interest in a prospect 
we derive our revenues from our interests in oil and gas production sold from prospects in which we own an interest  whether through royalty interests  working interest or other arrangements 
our revenues vary directly based on a combination of production volumes from wells in which we own an interest  market prices of oil and natural gas sold and our percentage interest in each prospect 
our well operating expenses vary depending upon the nature of our interest in each prospect 
we may bear no interest or a proportionate interest in the costs of drilling  completing and operating prospects on which we own an interest 
other than well drilling  completion and operating expenses  our principal operating expenses relate to our efforts to identify and secure prospects  comply with our various reporting obligations as a publicly held company and general overhead expenses 
business developments during and drilling activity during  we drilled international wells in colombia  as follows wells were drilled on concessions in which we hold a working interest  of which  at december   were in production and were dry holes 
one well was drilled on concessions in which we hold a working interest and was deemed a dry hole 
one well was drilled on a concession in which we hold a working interest  was sold as part of the caracara transaction and was in production at the time of that sale 
during  one domestic well  the n 
bayou henry prospect was drilled and was deemed a dry hole 
the caddo lake prospect was drilled during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  pipeline construction and connection to the well was completed and several completion attempts in the cotton valley formation were not successful 
currently a bossier shale test is planned subject to a unit and permit being granted

index to financial statements at december   two wells were being drilled in colombia and one well was being drilled in the us sale of caracara assets in june  we  through hupecol caracara llc as owner operator under the caracara association contract  sold all of our interest in the caracara association contract and related assets 
pursuant to our investment in hupecol caracara llc  we held a working interest in the caracara assets  covering approximately  acres  representing our principal  and initial  colombian prospect 
at december   the estimated proved reserves associated with these assets totaled  barrels of oil  which represented of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
as a result of the sale of the caracara assets  we received net proceeds  after deduction of fees and expenses of the transaction  of  realized a gain on the sale of  and eliminated from oil and gas properties costs subject to amortization associated with the caracara assets totaling  pursuant to the terms of the sale of the caracara assets  on the closing date of the sale  a portion of the purchase price was deposited in escrow to settle post closing adjustments under the purchase and sale agreement 
the funds deposited in escrow will be released to us  or to the purchaser  based on post closing adjustments months following closing 
our proportionate interest in the escrow deposit  totaling  has been recorded as other current assets 
the net proceeds and the gain realized from the sale of the caracara assets may be adjusted based on post closing adjustments 
colombian taxes attributable to the sale of the caracara assets  totaling  were recorded and paid at the time of closing 
production from the caracara prospect accounted for  and  of our revenues during and  respectively 
lease operating expense from the caracara prospect accounted for  and  of our lease operating expense during and  respectively 
leasehold activity during  we acquired  through our interest in hupecol caracara llc  an interest in the la cuerva contract covering approximately  acres in colombia 
during  we acquired interests in two additional prospects in south louisiana for which we advanced leasehold costs and delay rentals of approximately  we sold our interest in one of the prospects the north henry bayou prospect during  retaining a carried interest in the prospect  for which we received  and sold our interest in the second prospect the home run prospect during for which we received  seismic activity during  our operator in colombia acquired approximately miles of additional seismic and geological data 
the additional data relates primarily to prospects in which we hold a working interest 
our share of the costs of such data acquisition was  the operator also acquired additional seismic data on the la cuerva prospect 
our share of this cost was

index to financial statements during we shot an additional square miles combined of seismic on the las garzas and leona contracts 
executive compensation restricted stock  stock options and bonus payments during  we recognized compensation expense  in addition to salaries  to our two executive officers consisting of  attributable to grants of  shares of restricted stock  payment of cash bonuses totaling  which bonuses were contingent on the completion of the sale of the caracara assets and were paid in june  and  attributable to grants of stock options 
dividends during the third and fourth quarters of  we declared and paid cash dividends to our shareholders of per share  or an aggregate of macroeconomic impact on oil and natural gas prices late in the third quarter of and accelerating during the fourth quarter of  the united states and global economies suffered a severe disruption in credit and financial markets that have been accompanied by economic contraction and a sharp drop in the price of oil and natural gas due to a projected decline in demand for oil and natural gas 
we have not historically entered into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to commodity price risks 
as a result of such macroeconomic conditions and our unhedged position  the prices at which we sell oil and natural gas declined markedly during the fourth quarter of and are expected to remain at substantially lower levels for the foreseeable future 
our total revenues and profitability declined during the fourth quarter of as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas prices and a reduction in our production and are expected to continue to be adversely affected for the foreseeable future 
determination to temporarily shut in colombian production as a result of the continued depressed commodity price environment in the first quarter of  hupecol  the operator of our colombian properties  made the determination to temporarily shut in production from the majority of our wells in colombia 
during the first quarter of  most of our colombian wells remained profitable to operate  however  the hupecol managing partners chose not to continue to produce what they considered valuable oil reserves at these low levels of profitability 
on march th  the company was notified by hupecol that the majority of its productive wells will be immediately restored to production 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting 
such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  costs of drilling  completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  but does not include any cost related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved 
no corporate overhead has been capitalized as of december  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves are amortized on a units of production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation 
the capitalized oil and gas property costs  less accumulated amortization  are limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves  calculated at prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and a discount factor of  b the cost of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized  c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  and d related income tax effects 
excess costs are charged to proved properties impairment expense 
unevaluated oil and gas properties 
unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped leases  net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties 
when leases are developed  expire or are abandoned  the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to depletable oil and gas properties 
additionally  we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease expirations and abandonments  and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases 
we record an allowance for impairment based on a review of present value of future cash flows 
any resulting charge is made to operations and reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of the recorded asset 
unevaluated oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at december  and at december  at december  acquisition costs evaluation costs retention costs total the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects include  and  expended for properties in south america at december  and december   respectively 
we are maintaining our interest in these properties and development has or is anticipated to commence within the next twelve months 
subordinated convertible notes and warrants derivative financial instruments 
the subordinated convertible notes and warrants issued during have been accounted for in accordance with sfas and eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
we identified the following instruments and derivatives requiring evaluation and accounting under the relevant guidance applicable to financial derivatives subordinated convertible notes conversion feature conversion price reset feature 
table of contents 
index to financial statements company s optional redemption right warrants warrants exercise price reset feature we identified the conversion feature  the conversion price reset feature and our optional early redemption right within the convertible notes to represent embedded derivatives 
these embedded derivatives were bifurcated from their respective host debt contracts and accounted for as derivative liabilities in accordance with eitf the conversion feature  the conversion price reset feature and our optional early redemption right within the convertible notes were bundled together as a single hybrid compound instrument in accordance with sfas no 
derivatives implementation group implementation issue no 
b  embedded derivatives separate accounting for multiple derivative features embedded in a single hybrid instrument 
we identified the common stock warrant to be a detachable derivative 
the warrant exercise price reset provision was identified as an embedded derivative within the common stock warrant 
the common stock warrant and the embedded warrant exercise price reset provision were accounted for as a separate single hybrid compound instrument 
the single compound embedded derivatives within subordinated convertible notes and the derivative liability for warrants were recorded at fair value at the date of issuance may   and were marked to market each quarter with changes in fair value recorded to our income statement as net change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
we utilized a third party valuation firm to fair value the single compound embedded derivatives under the following methods a layered discounted probability weighted cash flow approach for the single compound embedded derivatives within subordinated convertible notes  and the black scholes model for the derivative liability for warrants based on a probability weighted exercise price 
the fair value of the derivative liabilities was subject to the changes in the trading value of our common stock 
as a result  our financial statements were subject to fluctuations from quarter to quarter based on factors  such as the price of our stock at the balance sheet date  the amount of shares converted by note holders and or exercised by warrant holders 
consequently  our financial position and results of operations varied from quarter to quarter based on conditions other than our operating revenues and expenses 
in may  each of the subordinated convertible notes and warrants accounted for as derivative financial instruments was converted or exercised 
accordingly  for subsequent periods  we have no derivative financial instruments requiring account under sfas stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the vesting term  dividend yield  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the statements of operations

our planned drilling activity is subject to change from time to time without notice 
in particular  the recent sharp decline in oil and gas prices may result in delays in  or abandonment of  planned drilling operations 
we also plan to selectively evaluate and acquire interests in additional drilling prospects 
at december   our acquisition and drilling budget for totaled approximately  consisting of  for drilling of eight wells in colombia   for drilling of three domestic wells  and  for infrastructure construction related cost in colombia 
our acquisition and drilling budget has historically been subject to substantial fluctuation over the course of a year based upon successes and failures in drilling and completion of prospects and the identification of additional prospects during the course of a year 
management anticipates that our current financial resources will meet our anticipated objectives and business operations  including our planned property acquisitions and drilling activities  for at least the next months without the need for additional capital 
management continues to evaluate producing property acquisitions as well as a number of drilling prospects 
it is possible  although not anticipated  that the company may require and seek additional financing if additional drilling prospects are pursued beyond those presently under consideration 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we have not historically entered into any hedges or other derivative commodity instruments or transactions designed to manage  or limit exposure to oil and gas price volatility
