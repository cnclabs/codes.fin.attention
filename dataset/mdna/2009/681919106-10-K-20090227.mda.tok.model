none of our acquisitions in  or were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
for information concerning our acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
geographic regions and segments our total consolidated revenue is almost evenly divided between us and us operations 
for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting  see our md a and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our clients consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy  our agencies serve similar clients  in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients  across a variety of geographic regions and locations 
our clients participate in virtually all industry sectors of the global economy 
furthermore  in many cases  our agencies or networks serve different product groups within the same clients served by other omnicom agencies or networks 
for example  our largest client was served by more than of our agencies in and represented of our consolidated revenue 
no other client accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue 
our top clients were each served  on average  by more than of our agencies in and collectively represented of our consolidated revenue 
our employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements 
the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar 
common to all is the ability to understand a client s brand or product  its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client s target audience 
recognizing the importance of this core competency  we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency

risk factors the global economic recession could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial condition 
contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit  a decrease in consumer and business spending  a significant rise in unemployment and other factors have all contributed to a global economic recession 
to some extent  every industry sector in most markets around the world has been adversely affected by the current economic conditions 
this has led to discretionary reductions in advertising  marketing and corporate communications services spending by both our us and international clients and was a contributing factor to the year over year decrease in our revenues in the fourth quarter of we expect that clients marketing spending will continue to contract for the near term 
if the global economic recession continues  our clients businesses could be adversely affected which would likely lead to reductions in client spending 
these reductions could adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 
the global credit crisis could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the bursting of the housing bubble and the related mortgage defaults that followed ultimately led to a crisis in the credit markets and a contraction in the availability of credit 
this crisis has made it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements 
a continuation of the credit crisis coupled with a prolonged economic recession could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors  including us 
if that were to occur  we could require additional capital to fund the changes in our day to day working capital requirements 
there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  in connection with the global credit crisis  several banks in the bank syndicate that supports our billion credit facility received capital infusions from their central governments 
in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity  the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment 
as a result  the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us and we could require additional capital 
there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
in a period of severe economic downturn  the risk of a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 
in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue 
these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
this risk could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn 
such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could materially adversely affect our working capital 
working capital is a source of cash as we have historically run a negative working capital cycle during the year 
this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients  including when we place media and incur production costs 
we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations 
the global economic recession could cause a reduction in the volume of client spending or a delay in the time our clients take to pay us which would negatively affect our working capital 
consequently  we could need to obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms  if at all 
such circumstances could therefore materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
companies periodically review and change their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships 
if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients  our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 
the businesses in which we participate are highly competitive 
key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs  the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer  and our ability to efficiently serve clients  particularly large international clients  on a broad geographic basis 
while many of our client relationships are long standing  clients put their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time 
we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews 
to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive  our revenue may be adversely affected  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we received approximately of our revenue from our largest clients in  and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects  business and results of operations and financial condition 
our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason 
it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns  or they could reduce future spending 
a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients  or the loss of several of our largest clients  if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients  would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel 
our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may  in some cases  be limited by clients perceptions of  or policies concerning  conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships 
if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests  our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel 
our employees are our most important assets 
our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected  which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services  which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope  content and manner of presentation of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services  through regulations or other governmental actions 
any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices 
such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future 
we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad  including political instability and exchange controls  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses 
the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions  competition for client assignments and talented staff  new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations 
there are risks of doing business abroad  including those of political instability and exchange controls  which do not affect domestic focused firms 
these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for financial information on our operations by geographic area  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 
we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world 
the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices  nationalization  social  political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions  among other risks 
in addition  commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague  inconsistently administered and retroactively applied 
if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business  our prospects  business  financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed  which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to billion  in whole or in part  at specified dates in the future 
in july  million of our notes can be put back to us for repurchase 
in june  our and notes aggregating million can be put to us for repurchase 
see next paragraph regarding our notes if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts 
we also believe that we will still have capacity under our existing credit commitments sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event 
however  in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were to decrease  we might need to seek additional funding alternatives 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms  if at all 
on february   holders of million aggregate principal amount of our notes had put their notes to us for purchase at par 
we borrowed million under our credit facility and received million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the notes 
we purchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes that had been put 
the partnership  formed for the purpose of buying the notes  used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the notes that were put 
the partnership purchased the notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next months if market conditions permit 
downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt a  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
our outstanding senior notes  convertible notes and existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade 
the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility  however  would increase if our long term debt credit rating is downgraded 
additionally  our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or long term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 
furthermore  the   and notes are convertible at specified ratios if  in the case of the notes and the notes  our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard poor s ratings service  or baa or lower by moody s investors service or in the case of the and notes to bbb or lower by s p  and ba or lower by moody s 
these events would not  however  result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 
we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses we believe may be complementary to our businesses and client needs 
as part of the review we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction 
despite our efforts  we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks 
as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition 
if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
goodwill may become impaired 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or gaap  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities  which principally represents the specialized know how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired 
we annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows 
while we have concluded  for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report  that our goodwill is not impaired  future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we maintain office space in many major cities around the world 
the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and we believe that our facilities are in suitable and well maintained condition for our current operations

our principal corporate offices are at madison avenue  new york  new york and one east weaver street  greenwich  connecticut 
we also maintain executive offices in london  england  shanghai  china  and tokyo  japan 
substantially all of our office space is leased from third parties with varying expiration dates ranging from one to years 
certain of our leases are subject to rent reviews or contain various escalation clauses and certain of our leases require us to pay various operating expenses  which may also be subject to escalation 
leases are generally denominated in the local currency of the operating entity

item legal proceedings beginning on june   several putative class actions were filed against us and certain senior executives in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the actions have since been consolidated under the caption in re omnicom group inc securities litigation  no 
cv rcc  on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of our common stock between february  and june  the consolidated complaint alleges  among other things  that our public filings and other public statements during that period contained false and misleading statements or omitted to state material information relating to our calculation of the organic growth component of period to period revenue growth  our valuation of and accounting for certain internet investments made by our communicade group communicade  which we contributed to seneca investments llc seneca in  and the existence and amount of certain contingent future obligations in respect of acquisitions 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages plus costs and attorneys fees 
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and on march   the court dismissed portions and of the complaint detailed above 
the court s decision denying the defendants motion to dismiss the remainder of the complaint did not address the ultimate merits of the case  but only the sufficiency of the pleading 
defendants have answered the complaint 
discovery concluded in the second quarter of on april   the court granted plaintiff s motion for class certification  certifying the class proposed by plaintiffs 
in the third quarter of defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiff s remaining claim 
on january   the court granted defendants motion in its entirety  dismissing all claims and directing the court to close the case 
on february   the plaintiffs filed a notice of intent to appeal that decision to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
the appeal has been fully briefed 
the parties await a date for oral argument before the court of appeals 
the defendants continue to believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose plaintiff s appeal 
in addition  on june   a derivative action was filed on behalf of omnicom in new york state court 
on february   a second shareholder derivative action  again purportedly brought on behalf of the company  was filed in new york state court 
the derivative actions have been consolidated before one new york state justice and the plaintiffs have filed an amended consolidated complaint 
the consolidated derivative complaint questions the business judgment of certain current and former directors of omnicom  by challenging  among other things  the valuation of and accounting for the internet investments made by communicade and the contribution of those investments to seneca 
the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of good faith 
the lawsuit seeks from the directors the amount of profits received from selling omnicom stock and other unspecified damages to be paid to the company  as well as costs and attorneys fees 
the defendants moved to dismiss the derivative complaint on the procedural ground that plaintiffs had failed to make a demand on the board 
on june   the trial court entered a decision denying the motion to dismiss 
the decision did not address the merits of the allegations  but rather accepted the allegations as true for the purposes of the motion as the court was required to do and excused plaintiffs from making a demand on the board 
in the first quarter of  defendants appealed the trial court s decision 
on september   the new york supreme court  appellate division  first department issued a decision reversing the trial court and dismissing the derivative claims 
plaintiffs served defendants with a motion seeking reargument of the appeal or  in the alternative  permission to appeal the decision to the court of appeals  new york s highest court 
on january   the court denied the plaintiff s motion 
we believe the matter is concluded 
the defendants in both cases believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose the lawsuits 
currently  we are unable to determine the outcome of these cases and the effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the outcome of any of these matters is inherently uncertain and may be affected by future events 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate effect of these matters 
we are also involved from time to time in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a strategic holding company 
we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world 
on a global  pan regional and local basis  our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients 
while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines  we organize our services around our clients 
the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources 
this client centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client s specific marketing requirements 
we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client centric approach  as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients 
in addition  we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong  entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 
in recent years  certain business trends have affected our business and our industry 
these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non traditional marketing channels  as well as utilizing interactive technologies and new media outlets 
additionally  in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets  clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers 
we believe these trends have benefitted our business in the past and  over the long term  will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 
contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit  a decrease in consumer spending  a significant rise in unemployment and other factors have all led to increasingly volatile capital markets over the course of during recent months  the financial services  automotive and other sectors of the global economy have come under increased pressure  resulting in  among other consequences  extraordinarily difficult conditions in the capital and credit markets and a global economic recession that has negatively impacted our clients spending on the services that our agencies provide 
as one of the world s leading advertising  marketing and corporate communications companies  we operate in all major markets of the global economy 
we have a large and diverse client base 
our largest client represented or our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  and no other client accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  our top clients accounted for of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than of revenue from our  largest clients for the year ended december  although our revenues are generally balanced between the us and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base  we are not immune to global economic conditions 
during the second half of  we experienced a decline in the rate of growth of our revenue compared to the second half of and  due to rapidly changing economic conditions  we have less visibility than we historically have had regarding client spending plans in the near term 
during previous periods of economic downturn  our industry experienced slower growth rates and industry wide margin contractions 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  in response to reductions in client spending  we took action to reduce our salary and service costs by reducing incentive compensation and through actions to limit our discretionary spending 
additionally  in anticipation of reductions in client spending in  we reduced our work force in the fourth quarter of and we incurred expenses related to severance benefits 
continued economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending may result in further reductions in client spending levels that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we intend to continue to closely monitor economic conditions  client spending and other factors  and in response  will take actions available to us to reduce costs  manage working capital and conserve cash 
in the current economic environment  there can be no assurance as to the effects of future economic circumstances  client spending patterns  client credit worthiness and other developments on us and whether and to what extent our efforts to respond to them will be effective 
given our size and breadth  we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators 
the key indicators that we review are revenue and operating expenses 
we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth  including growth by major geographic location  growth by major marketing discipline  growth from currency fluctuations  growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients 
in recent years  our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations 
in  our overall revenue growth was  of which was related to changes in foreign exchange rates and was related to the acquisition of entities  net of entities disposed 
the remainder   was organic growth 
in  traditional media advertising represented about of our total revenue and grew by over the prior year 
crm represented about of the total revenue and grew by over the previous year 
public relations represented about of the total revenue and decreased by from the prior year  and specialty communications represented about of total revenue and decreased by from the prior year 
we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs  and office and general expenses 
salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs 
office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs  technology related costs and depreciation and amortization 
each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines 
at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client s brand and its selling proposition  and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client s target audience 
the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines  and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
because we are a service business  we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs as a percentage of revenue 
salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue 
office and general expenses  which are not directly related to servicing clients  are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than salary and service costs 
these costs tend to increase as revenue increases  however  the rate of increase in these expenses could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 
during  salary and service costs increased slightly to of revenue versus of revenue in the increase in salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to recording severance benefits in the fourth quarter of that were million greater than the amount recorded in the comparable period in we recorded these severance benefits as a result of reducing our work force in anticipation of reductions in client spending in office and general expenses decreased slightly during to of revenue from in our net income for increased by to  million from million in and our diluted eps increased by to from in the prior year for the reasons described above  as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year 
this reduction was the result of our purchases through and the first eight months of of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 
critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting policies we have prepared the following summary of our critical accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related md a 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  including our discussion in note setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail  for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below 
estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets  accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results can differ from those estimates  and it is possible that the differences could be material 
a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and when evaluating cost method investments  which consist of ownership interests in non public companies  to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
we consider and use several comparable market participant measurements to determine fair value  including consideration of similar and recent transactions and  when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples 
we also use a discounted expected cash flow methodology 
numerous estimates and assumptions have to be made when completing a discounted expected cash flow valuation  including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates  appropriate discount rates and capital structure 
additionally  estimates must be made regarding revenue growth  operating margins  tax rates  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
judgment is required when determining fair value  including when we evaluate the applicability of similar and recent transactions  and when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used 
actual results of operations  cash flows and other factors used in a discounted expected cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material 
additional information about impairment testing under sfas and valuation of cost method investments appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
a fair value approach is used in determining the award value of share based employee compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards 
this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life  rate of risk free interest  volatility and dividend yield 
if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value  our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 
additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and goodwill we have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions 
in making acquisitions  the price we pay is determined by various factors  including specialized know how  reputation  competitive position  geographic coverage and service offerings  as well as our experience and judgment 
the amount we paid for acquisitions  including cash and assumption of net liabilities  totaled million in and million in approximately and  respectively  of these amounts related to contingent purchase price obligations  sometimes referred to as earn outs  paid during the respective year related to acquisitions previously completed 
a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
the amount of contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are based on future performance 
contingent purchase price obligations  for acquisitions completed prior to january  are accrued  in accordance with gaap  when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 
our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and or their service capabilities to better serve our clients 
additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know how of the acquisition targets 
accordingly  like most service businesses  a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the know how of the people  which is treated as part of goodwill and  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  is not valued separately 
for each of our acquisitions  we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such assets identified 
the majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships  including the related customer contracts 
when making the necessary valuation assumptions of these identified intangible assets  we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 
the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the second quarter of the year 
in accordance with paragraph of sfas  we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments  which are our five agency networks 
the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region 
they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions 
we then concluded that for each of our operating segments  their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level 
our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in paragraph of sfas no  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  and the guidance set forth in eitf d clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph of fasb statement no 
consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy  the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients 
in addition  the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics  as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services  the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy  and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
finally  the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
based on the results of our impairment testing  we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their book value and therefore  our goodwill was not impaired

changes in accounting for acquisitions in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited and sfas r will apply to business combinations entered into after january  we will adopt sfas r on january  sfas r will require  among other things that the acquirer record of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed even when less than of the target is acquired  all transaction costs be expensed as incurred  and  a liability for contingent purchase price obligations earn outs  if any  be recorded at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value and included in earnings in each subsequent reporting period 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour  or equivalent basis  and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement  upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured 
we record revenue net of sales tax  use tax and value added tax 
certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 
these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
more specifically  in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as updated by sab  revenue recognition sab  our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery  performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement  and collection is reasonably assured 
because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways  all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 
in the majority of our businesses  we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained  when the fee or commission is earned 
in certain cases  we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and third party production costs and are responsible for their payment  recharging our clients for all costs incurred 
although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities  the arrangements with our clients are such that  in effect  we act as an agent on their behalf 
in these cases  costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue 
a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals 
we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved  or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 
additional information about our revenue recognition appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
employee share based compensation on january   we adopted sfas r 
our outstanding share based compensation awards are principally stock options and restricted stock 
in accordance with sfas r  because our awards are share settled  we record employee share based compensation at fair value on the date of grant 
on january   we elected to adopt sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting  for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas and  as provided by sfas  we elected to apply it retroactively 
accordingly  our net income for all years presented includes a compensation charge for the grant date fair value of all share based compensation awards in the respective year the award was earned 
as a result of our election in to adopt sfas  as amended by sfas  the adoption of sfas r in did not have a significant effect on our financial statements 
sfas r requires  among other things  that we record share based compensation net of an estimate for awards that are expected to be forfeited 
on january   we recorded an increase to our operating income and net income of million and million  respectively  as a result of the cumulative effect of this change in accounting for forfeitures 
however  because this adjustment was not significant  we did not present it on an after tax basis as a cumulative effect of an accounting change on our income statement 
in estimating the grant date of fair value stock option awards  we use certain assumptions and estimates to derive fair value  such as expected term  rate of risk free interest  volatility and dividend yield 
if different assumptions and estimates were used  the amounts charged to compensation expense would be different 
however  due to limited stock option award activity in the past several years and given that most stock option awards that are outstanding have been fully expensed in our financial statement  the impact of using different assumptions and estimates would not be material on our current results of operations 
pre tax share based employee compensation expense for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively

revenue when comparing performance between years  we discuss non gaap financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes  acquisitions dispositions and organic growth have on reported revenue 
we derive significant revenue from international operations and year over year changes in foreign currency rates impact our reported results 
our reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth 
accordingly  we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue period to period 
our consolidated worldwide revenue increased to  million from  million in the effect of foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by million 
acquisitions  net of dispositions  increased worldwide revenue by million and organic growth increased worldwide revenue by million 
the components of total revenue growth in the us domestic and the remainder of the world international are summarized below dollars in millions total domestic international december     components of revenue changes foreign exchange impact acquisitions  net of dispositions organic december     our fourth quarter consolidated worldwide revenue decreased to  million from  million in the fourth quarter of the effect of foreign exchange impacts decreased worldwide revenue by million 
acquisitions  net of dispositions  increased fourth quarter worldwide revenue by million and organic growth decreased worldwide revenue by million 
the components of total fourth quarter revenue in the us domestic and the remainder of the world international are summarized below dollars in millions total domestic international december     components of revenue changes foreign exchange impact acquisitions  net of dispositions organic december    during the second half of  we experienced a decline in the rate of growth of our revenue compared to the second half of and  due to the rapidly changing economic conditions  we have less visibility than we historically have had regarding client spending plans in the near term 
client spending began to contract in the last half of and the contraction accelerated in the fourth quarter of the decline was broad based across all industry segments and geographic areas 
continued economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending may result in further reductions in client spending levels that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the components and percentages are calculated as follows the foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue in this case  million and  million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter  respectively 
the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency in this case  million less  million and  million less  million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter  respectively 
the acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses 
netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period 
the organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth 
the percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component in this case  million and  million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter  respectively 
the components of revenue and revenue growth for the full year and fourth quarter in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions compared to q compared to q revenue growth revenue growth united states   euro markets  united kingdom  other  total   for the full year  foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by million 
the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening  especially during the first half of the year  of the euro  japanese yen and brazilian real against the us dollar  which was offset primarily by the decline of the british pound and korean won against the us dollar 
beginning in the third quarter of and especially during the last four months of the year  the us dollar strengthened against most other major currencies 
however  the foreign exchange impact for the year was still positive 
for the fourth quarter of  foreign exchange impacts decreased our international revenue by million 
the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound  euro  brazilian real  australian dollar  and korean won  which was offset slightly by the weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
assuming exchange rates at january  remain unchanged  we expect foreign exchange impacts to decrease our full year consolidated revenue by between and 
additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
due to a variety of factors  in the normal course  our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year 
the net result in was an overall gain in new business 
under our client centric approach  we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients 
revenue from our single largest client represented of our worldwide revenue in both and no other client represented more than in or more than in our ten largest and largest clients represented and of our worldwide revenue  respectively  and and of our worldwide revenue  respectively 
driven by our clients continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities  we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services through various client centric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives 
these services include advertising  brand consultancy  crisis communications  custom publishing  database management  digital and interactive marketing  direct marketing  directory advertising  entertainment marketing  environmental design  experiential marketing  field marketing  financial corporate business to business advertising  graphic arts  healthcare communications  instore design  investor relations  marketing research  media planning and buying  mobile marketing services  multi cultural marketing  non profit marketing  organizational communications  package design  product placement  promotional marketing  public affairs  public relations  recruitment communications  reputation consulting  retail marketing  search engine marketing and sports and event marketing 
in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients  we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
year ended december  dollars in millions vs revenue of revenue revenue of revenue growth growth traditional media advertising   crm   public relations   specialty communications   operating expenses our worldwide operating expenses increased million  or  to  million from  million in  as shown below 
year ended december  dollars in millions vs of revenue of total operating expenses of revenue of total operating expenses growth growth revenue   operating expenses salary and service costs   office and general expenses  total operating expenses   operating profit   because we provide professional services  salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses 
as a percentage of total operating expenses  salary and service costs were in and in these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs 
salary and service costs accounted for million of the million increase in total operating expenses 
during the first nine months of  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly compared to the same period in however  given the reduction of revenue that occurred in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  we took actions to reduce incentive compensation and our discretionary spending 
as a result of taking these actions the ratio of salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue for the full year would have been similar to that of  however  we reduced our work force in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of reductions in client spending in and we incurred expenses related to severance benefits that were million greater than similar costs incurred in the fourth quarter of as a result of these incremental severance costs  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to for the full year of compared to in office and general expenses represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents  technology costs and depreciation  amortization of identifiable intangible assets  professional fees and other overhead expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  office and general expenses decreased marginally in from to 
these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs 
although they tend to increase as our revenues increase  the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 
net interest expense our net interest expense increased slightly by million in to million  as compared to million in our gross interest expense increased by million to million 
the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense on our euro and yen denominated swaps  which were terminated in the second half of  and additional interest expense due to an increase in our average debt outstanding  partially offset by interest expense savings in associated with a decrease in the amortization in accordance with eitf no 
 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments eitf of supplemental interest payments that were made on our zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due and notes and notes in prior periods 
the total increase in gross interest expense was almost entirely offset by increased interest income earned on our foreign cash balances 
in february  we borrowed million under our credit facility to fund the purchase of our notes by us and a partnership we control 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a floating base rate or the eurocurrency rate  plus an applicable margin 
as a result  we expect our gross interest expense to increase in additionally  assuming exchange rates and interest rates at january  remain unchanged  we expect interest income earned on our foreign cash balances to decrease in see liquidity and capital resources and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was  which is down slightly from our rate of  primarily due to lower rates in various foreign jurisdictions 
earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons  our net income in increased million  or  to  million from million in diluted earnings per share increased to in  as compared to in the prior year for the reasons described above  as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year

during  we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel 
as a percentage of total operating expenses  salary and service costs were in and in these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs 
most  or million and  of the  million increase in total operating expenses in  resulted from increases in salary and service costs 
this increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives  including direct salaries  salary related costs and direct service costs  including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs  such as travel  as well as increases in incentive based compensation costs 
this increase was partially offset by reductions in employee stock based compensation expense 
as a result  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue were relatively stable year to year at in compared to in office and general expenses represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents  technology costs and depreciation  amortization of identifiable intangible assets  professional fees and other overhead expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  office and general expenses increased marginally in from to  but remained flat year over year on a constant currency basis 
these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs 
although they tend to increase as our revenues increase  the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 
included in office and general expense for operating margin is a pre tax net loss of million arising from the sale in the third quarter of a us based healthcare business and several small businesses 
the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the non deductibility of goodwill 
this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a one time reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws 
the aggregate impact of these events was a decrease in profit before tax of million  a decrease in tax expense of million and an increase in net income of million 
net interest expense our net interest expense in decreased by million in to million  as compared to million in our gross interest expense decreased by million to million 
the decrease was primarily impacted by interest expense savings associated with the amortization  in accordance with eitf no 
 of supplemental interest payments made with respect to our and notes that were made in  but not in this reduction was offset by million of additional interest costs in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  related to the issuance in late march of our senior notes due april  senior notes 
during the third quarter of  volatility in the financial markets resulted in an increase in borrowing spreads in the commercial paper markets 
to mitigate the effect of these increased spreads  we arranged for million in unsecured uncommitted lines of credit and shifted funding a portion of our daily needs to these lines from our commercial paper program 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december   as these lines were terminated during the fourth quarter of income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was  which is up slightly from our rate of 
excluding the net reduction in income tax expense in  resulting from the resolution of uncertainties in the third quarter related to changes in certain tax laws that was somewhat offset by a high book tax rate related to dispositions in the third quarter of  the tax rate in would have been  which is more in line with the rate 
in connection with our adoption of fin  there was no significant change to our effective tax rate in earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons  our net income in increased million  or  to million from million in diluted earnings per share increased to in  as compared to in the prior year for the reasons described above  as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year 
the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases throughout and of treasury shares  net of shares issued upon option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
liquidity and capital resources cash sources and requirements  including contractual obligations historically  substantially all of our non discretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
our principal non discretionary funding requirement is our working capital 
in addition  as discussed below  we have contractual obligations related to our debt  senior notes and convertible notes  our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations  as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years 
our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders  repurchases of our common stock  payments for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow  cash on hand and short term investments 
in addition  in any given year  depending on the level of discretionary activity  we may use other sources of available funding  such as the liquidation of short term investments or the issuance of commercial paper to finance these activities 
we have a seasonal working capital cycle 
working capital requirements are lowest at year end 
the fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than billion 
this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients  including when we place media and incur production costs 
we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations 
during the year  we manage liquidity through our credit facilities  as discussed below under cash management 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from december  the components of the decrease in are summarized below dollars in millions sources cash flow from operations  add back decrease in net working capital subtotal  principal cash sources  uses capital expenditures dividends paid acquisition payments  net of cash acquired purchase of treasury shares net of proceeds from stock option exercises and stock sold in our employee stock purchase plan of million subtotal  principal discretionary cash uses  discretionary cash uses in excess of principal cash sources exchange rate changes other  principally financing activities deduct decrease in net working capital decrease in cash and cash equivalents the principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses amounts presented above are non gaap financial measures 
these amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities  including commercial paper issuances and redemptions  used to fund these working capital changes 
this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information presented in compliance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 
cash management we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our wholly owned finance subsidiaries that manage our treasury centers in north america  europe and asia 
each day  operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center 
likewise  operations that require funding will borrow funds from their regional treasury center 
the treasury centers then aggregate the net position of the operating companies 
the net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers 
to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity  they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit  our billion credit facility  or depending on market conditions at the time  issue up to billion of us dollar denominated commercial paper 
this enables us to more efficiently manage our debt balances and effectively utilize our cash  as well as better manage our exposure to foreign exchange 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million and our short term investments decreased by million from the prior year 
short term investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle  generally within one year 
the majority of our short term investments represent time deposits that mature in at december  and  our short term investments did not include any auction rate securities 
we manage our net debt position  which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and short term investments  centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above 
our net debt outstanding at december  increased by million as compared to the prior year end  as summarized below dollars in millions debt bank loans due less than one year commercial paper issued under billion revolver due june  year notes due april  convertible notes due february  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt total debt   cash and short term investments   net debt   on february   holders of million aggregate principal amount of our notes put their notes to us for purchase at par 
we borrowed million under our credit facility and received million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the notes 
we purchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes that had been put 
the partnership  formed for the purpose of buying the notes  used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the notes that were put 
the partnership purchased the notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next months if market conditions permit 
the partnership will be consolidated within our financial statements 
net debt is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this presentation  together with the comparable gaap measure  is meaningful for understanding our liquidity and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information presented in compliance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to billion as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our credit facility provides back up liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us  as well as support for our commercial paper borrowings 
depending on market conditions at the time  we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper  borrowing under our short term uncommitted lines of credit  or drawing down on our credit facility 
during  we issued and redeemed billion of commercial paper and we borrowed and repaid billion under the credit facility 
the average term of the commercial paper was days and the average borrowing under the credit facility was days 
as of december   we had no commercial paper or bank loans outstanding under our credit facility 
at december   we had short term borrowings of million outstanding  which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries 
these bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries bank agreements 
our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements 
these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement  ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to no more than times 
in addition  they require us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least times 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants  as our ratio of debt to ebitda was times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was times 
in addition  our credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt a  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt credit ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
our outstanding senior notes  convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded 
the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities  however  will increase if our long term debt credit rating is lowered 
our wholly owned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc oci and omnicom finance inc ofi provide funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries 
oci and ofi s assets consist of intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable 
oci and ofi are co issuers and co obligors of our senior notes and convertible notes 
there are no restrictions in the applicable indentures on the ability of oci  ofi or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends  loans or advances 
the senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of us  oci and ofi  and we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of oci and ofi with respect to the senior notes and convertible notes 
in march  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due april  the gross proceeds from the issuance were million 
the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a yield to maturity 
the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness 
on march   we entered into an agreement to purchase million shares of our outstanding common stock for million 
we repurchased the shares under an accelerated share repurchase asr program with a financial institution at per share with an initial settlement date of april  the purchase was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our senior notes offering 
during the second quarter of  the financial institution purchased the million shares of our common stock in the open market and we paid a settlement amount of million  referred to as the purchase price adjustment  based upon the difference between the actual cost of the shares purchased by the financial institution of per share and the initial purchase price of per share 
at december   we had a total of  million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding  including million notes that were issued in february  million notes that were issued in march  million zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due that were issued in june and million zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due notes that were originally issued in june as notes that were subsequently amended in june to become the notes 
the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in february of each year 
the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in august of each year 
the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june     and on each june annually thereafter through june  the   and notes are convertible  at specified ratios  only upon the occurrence of certain events  including if our common shares trade above certain levels  if we effect extraordinary transactions or  in the case of the notes and the notes  if our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard poor s ratings service  or baa or lower by moody s investors service or in the case of the and notes to bbb or lower by s p  and ba or lower by moody s 
these events would not  however  result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 
for additional information about the terms of these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  we paid a supplemental interest payment of million to qualified noteholders of our notes that did not put their notes back to us

we purchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes that had been put 
the partnership  formed for the purpose of buying the notes  used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the notes that were put 
the partnership purchased the notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next months if market conditions permit 
the partnership will be consolidated in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  as amended  and fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and as a result  all of the notes held by the partnership will be eliminated in consolidation 
the following table presents our outstanding debt at december   after giving effect to the purchase of the notes and does not reflect any other financing activities that occurred subsequent to december  dollars in millions bank loans due in less than one year billion revolver due june  senior notes due april  convertible notes due february  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt total  credit markets and availability of credit in light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions  we continue to seek to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to actively manage our discretionary expenditures 
we have not repurchased any of our common stock since august and we do not plan to resume our repurchases until we believe that the credit markets have begun to stabilize 
we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients 
we believe that these actions  in addition to the availability of our billion credit facility  are sufficient to fund our near term working capital needs and our discretionary spending 
for additional information about our credit facility  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the next date on which holders of the notes can put the notes back to us for cash is july the next date on which holders of the notes and notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june if our convertible notes are put back to us  based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put 
although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements  we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 
in funding our day to day liquidity  we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market 
recent disruptions in the credit markets have led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads 
to mitigate these conditions and to fund our day to day liquidity through the end of  we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit facility  while reducing the volume and the terms of our commercial paper borrowings 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any further disruptions in the credit markets 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business 
the following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations as of december  and should be read together with note debt  note income taxes  note commitments and contingent liabilities  note fair value of financial instruments and note derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements dollars in millions due in less than year due in to years due in to years due in more than years total contractual obligations at december  long term debt  convertible notes   lease obligations  uncertain tax positions total    other contractual obligations at december  lines of credit guarantees total our liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid 
we have assigned the liability to the period s presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 
as more fully described above under the heading debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants  the holders of the convertible notes at december  included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future 
if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date  as set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements   million of convertible notes could be due in less than one year and million could be due in less than two years 
the next dates on which holders of the notes and notes can put the notes back to us for cash are february and july  respectively 
the next date on which holders of the notes and notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june we have classified the convertible notes as long term in our balance sheet because our credit facility does not expire until june and it is our intention to fund any put with our credit facility 
on february   holders of million aggregate principal amount of our notes put their notes to us for purchase at par 
we borrowed million under our credit facility and received million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the notes 
we purchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes that had been put 
the partnership  formed for the purpose of buying the notes  used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the notes that were put 
the partnership purchased the notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next months if market conditions permit 
in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue 
these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations  then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients 
however  this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn 
pension plan funding we maintain two us and twenty nine non us noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the benefit obligation for our defined benefit plans was million at december  the fair value of assets for these plans at december  was million 
during  we contributed million to our defined benefit plans 
we do not expect our contributions to increase significantly from contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations  often referred to as earn outs 
we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the post acquisition transition period 
these payments are not contingent upon future employment 
the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for prior acquisitions  assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  is approximately million as of december  the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with us gaap  we have not recorded a liability for these items on our balance sheet since the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable 
actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates 
our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period  changes in the acquired entities performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these differences could be significant 
the contingent purchase price obligations as of december   calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  are as follows dollars in millions thereafter total contingently redeemable minority interests owners of interests in the common stock of certain of our subsidiaries or affiliates have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional ownership interests at fair values as defined in the applicable agreements 
the intent of the parties is to approximate fair value at the time of redemption by using a multiple of earnings which is consistent with generally accepted valuation practices by market participants in our industry 
the redemption features are embedded in the shares owned by the minority shareholders and are not freestanding 
as a result  sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  does not apply 
additionally  the embedded redemption features do not fall within the scope of eitf issue no 
 majority owners accounting for a transaction in the shares of a consolidated subsidiary and a derivative indexed to the minority interest in that subsidiary  because they do not represent a de facto financing 
consistent with accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  as amended  minority interests have been recorded on the balance sheet at historical cost plus an allocation of subsidiary earnings based on ownership interests  less dividends paid to the minority shareholders 
historically  we have provided a description and an estimate of the redemption features 
although eitf topic no 
d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities eitf d does not specifically address contingently redeemable minority interests  we considered applying it by analogy to the redeemable minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries 
had we applied eitf d  we would have reported our minority interests at the higher of their carrying value or their redemption fair value through a direct reduction to shareholders equity with no impact on earnings 
further  had we applied eitf d upon redemption  any prior adjustments to accrete minority interests to their redemption value  had we recorded them  would have been reversed as a direct adjustment to shareholders equity with no impact on earnings 
assuming that the subsidiaries and affiliates perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels  the aggregate amount we could be required to pay in future periods is approximately million  million of which relates to obligations that are currently exercisable 
if these rights are exercised  there would likely be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense 
the ultimate amount payable relating to these transactions will vary because it is primarily dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses  the timing of the exercise of these rights and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the actual amount that we pay is likely to be different from this estimate and the difference could be significant 
the redemption value of the obligations that exist for these agreements as of december   calculated using the assumptions above  are as follows dollars in millions currently exercisable not currently exercisable total subsidiary agencies affiliated agencies total as a result of an amendment made to eitf d in  we will be required  effective january   to record an estimate of the redemption fair value of our minority shareholders interests of million on our balance sheet through a direct reduction of shareholders equity 
there will be no impact on earnings upon adoption 
additionally  changes in the redemption value will be remeasured through shareholders equity in future reporting periods with no impact on earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations  which are generally denominated in the local currency 
the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
for the most part  our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency 
this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our net income 
while our agencies conduct business in more than different currencies  our major non us currency markets are the european monetary union emu  the united kingdom  japan  brazil and canada 
as an integral part of our treasury operations  we enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest 
in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency  amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments 
the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from two to days with an average duration under days 
in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement  we enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge us dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center  whose functional currency is the british pound 
at december   we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as there was no commercial paper outstanding 
additionally  during the second half of  we terminated our euro and yen denominated cross currency interest rate swaps 
the effect of terminating our euro and yen denominated swaps on our results of operations was not significant 
the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks 
these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program 
as a result of these financial instruments  we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 
in using these contracts  we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk 
to minimize counterparty risk  we only enter into these contracts with major well known banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating 
these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations 
we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks 
we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a value at risk computation 
value at risk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
the value at risk analysis we performed on our december  portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial 
this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action  if appropriate 
debt instruments in march  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april  the gross proceeds from the issuance were million 
the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a yield to maturity 
the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our wholly owned finance subsidiaries  omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc  as co obligors 
the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co obligors 
we maintain a billion credit facility that expires on june  we have the ability to classify outstanding borrowings  if any  under our credit facility as long term debt 
our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank  jpmorgan chase  hsbc  rbs  deutsche  bank of america  societe generale and bbva 
we also include large regional banks in the us such as us bancorp  northern trust  pnc and wells fargo 
we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as bnp paribas in france  sumitomo in japan  intesa san paolo in italy  scotia in canada and anz in australia 
recently  several banks that were in our bank syndicate merged with other global financial institutions 
wachovia  comprising a million commitment  merged with wells fargo 
wells fargo is a member of our bank syndicate 
in addition  abn amro  comprising a million commitment  merged with rbs 
rbs was not a member of our bank syndicate prior to the merger with abn amro 
additionally  in connection with the global credit crisis  several banks in our bank syndicate received capital infusions from their central governments 
in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity  the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment and the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us 
the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount 
at december   the next dates on which holders of the notes and notes can put the notes back to us for cash are february and july  respectively 
the next date on which holders of the notes and notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june as we have done on prior occasions  we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date 
if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment  the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date  including our stock price  short term interest rates and a factor for credit risk 
on february   holders of million aggregate principal amount of our notes put their notes to us for purchase at par 
we borrowed million under our credit facility and received million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the notes 
we purchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes that had been put 
the partnership  formed for the purpose of buying the notes  used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the notes that were put 
the partnership purchased the notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next months if market conditions permit 
if the remaining outstanding convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put 
although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements  we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 
additionally  if the convertible notes are put back to us  our interest expense will change 
the extent  if any  of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced  when we refinance  the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing 
even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar for dollar basis  it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio 
if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest bearing debt at prevailing rates  this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios  such as ebitda to interest expense 
however  the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds 
if either our ratio of debt to ebitda increased by  or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense decreased by  we would still be in compliance with these covenants 
therefore  based on our current coverage ratios  our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets  we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements 
concentration of credit risk we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and  in the normal course of business  we grant credit to qualified clients 
due to the diversified nature of our client base  we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for  and no other client accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  however  during periods of economic downturn  the credit profiles of our clients could change 
in many of our businesses  we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue 
these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients 
however  this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn
