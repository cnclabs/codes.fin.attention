overview of our business we are one of the world s leading providers of advanced digital television solutions dedicated to creating and delivering compelling viewing experiences to consumers of digital content worldwide 
our software enables cable  satellite  telecommunications and digital terrestrial operators  which we refer to as network operators  to offer enhanced television experiences to their viewers 
the majority of our revenue typically comes from one time royalty fees paid by network operators or manufacturers of set top boxes once a set top box  which incorporates our software  has been shipped to or activated by the network operator 
we also derive revenue from the licensing of related software and interactive content and applications associated with the delivery of digital and interactive television  as well as from licensing products that enable advanced advertising solutions 
in addition  we receive professional services fees from consulting  systems integration and training engagements  fees for the maintenance and support of our products and fees from revenue sharing arrangements related to the use of our interactive content and applications 
our revenue model may change over time 
for example  we have signed subscription based licensing agreements under which we receive monthly payments for each set top box that includes our software that our customers deploy  for so long as those set top boxes remain active 
in addition  our technology and services are provided indirectly through distribution arrangements with key partners other than network operators and set top box manufacturers  such as conditional access vendors  and we expect revenues generated from such distribution arrangements to increase over time 
kudelski sa  directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries  beneficially owns class a and class b ordinary shares of our company collectively representing approximately of the economic interest and approximately of the voting interest in our company  based on the number of our ordinary shares outstanding as of december  recent events on february   we received a non binding proposal from kudelski sa to acquire all of our class a ordinary shares that are not currently owned by kudelski or its affiliates 
on march   our board of directors appointed a special committee consisting of three independent directors to review the proposal 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we made our best estimates and judgments  which are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  restructuring costs  share based compensation and fair value measurement 
all of these accounting policies and estimates  together with their underlying assumptions  and their impact on our financial statements  have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap as has been prescribed for the software industry  the principal policies of which are reflected in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
the application of sop requires judgment about a number of matters  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements of the arrangement exists 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue to recognize currently and which portions to defer and recognize in later periods 
in some cases  we may be required to record the costs incurred in connection with our performance of a software licensing arrangement before we are able to recognize the revenue generated by such arrangement  even if we have invoiced the customer or received payment from the customer 
in other cases  we may be required to record costs incurred in connection with our performance of a software licensing arrangement in the same manner as we would for cost of inventory  in which case we would charge those costs to operations over time as the related revenue is recognized 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to products and services that constitute future deliverables and the appropriate valuation for those products and services 
our judgments and estimates regarding future deliverables could differ from actual events 
because the terms of our licensing arrangements may differ by customer  including subscription based or one time royalty payment arrangements  we may apply different revenue recognition policies to different customer contracts depending upon those particular terms 
for fixed bid contracts under the percentage of completion method  the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on actual costs incurred to total estimated costs 
the actual results could differ from the percentage estimates by the time a project is complete 
in addition  the recognition of revenues is impacted by our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable  which is based on  among other things  the commercial and financial condition of the relevant customer  payment history and general economic conditions 
as a result  depending upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the particular accounts receivable  the timing or amount of revenue recognized may differ depending upon our assessment of the probability of collection at the time the associated transaction is recorded in revenue 

table of contents valuation allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of our valuation allowance 
currently  we maintain a partial valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
adjustments may be required in the future if our estimate of the realizable amount of deferred tax assets changes 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill  property and equipment  other assets and other intangible assets  which are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the most significant assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is revenue 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments that can be significantly impacted by changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  competition and demographic trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
restructuring costs we continuously monitor our organizational structure and associated operating expenses 
depending upon events and circumstances  actions may be taken periodically to restructure the business 
restructuring activities may include terminating employees  abandoning excess office space and incurring other exit costs 
any resulting restructuring costs depend on numerous estimates made by us based on our knowledge of the activity being affected  the cost to exit existing commitments and fair value estimates 
these estimates could differ from actual results 
we monitor the initial estimates periodically and record an adjustment for any significant changes in estimates 
share based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our share price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected share price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable  actual experience may differ materially from our assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and binomial lattice models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the 
table of contents actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based awards in the future 
certain share based awards  such as employee stock options  may expire without any value having been realized by the employee  notwithstanding the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no widely accepted market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r and sab no 
 interaction between fasb statement no 
r  and certain sec rules and regulations regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangement for public companies  sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may materially affect the fair value estimates of future share based awards  which may result in a lack of consistency with prior periods 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report on form k for further information regarding the impact of sfas r on our financial statements 
fair value measurement the reported amounts of our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable debt securities  accounts receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  approximate fair value due to their short maturities 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

sfas provides the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the intent to mitigate volatility in financial reporting that can occur when related assets and liabilities are recorded on different bases 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option is elected would be reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years that began after november  we adopted sfas as of january  we currently do not have any additional financial instruments or other items that are eligible for election of the fair value option

we continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of eitf on our financial statements 
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we have prepared a report  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  which evaluates our internal control over financial reporting as of december  that complete report  as well as our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and our remediation efforts  if any  are included under item a of this annual report on form k  which investors should read in its entirety 
we are required to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
those controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 
while those controls may be expected to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of our financial reporting  we do not expect that such controls will prevent all errors and fraud 
we monitor our controls and maintain those controls as dynamic systems that change including improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 
as we assessed our internal control over financial reporting  we sought to identify various deficiencies or weaknesses that we may have and  if any were identified  to correct those deficiencies or weaknesses as promptly as practicable 
we are required to disclose any material weaknesses that we have identified 
the public company accounting oversight board  which was established under the sarbanes oxley act  defines a material weakness as a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
we also maintain a system of disclosure controls that have been designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the securities exchange act of  as amended  including this annual report on form k  is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec 
as more fully described in item a of this annual report on form k  based on our assessment  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our system of disclosure controls were effective as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues we have entered into commercial arrangements involving both product licenses and service elements that are bundled together 
under gaap  revenues from such bundled offerings have been allocated to the royalties and licenses and services and other revenue line items based on the relative fair values of the product and service elements in each of the contracts 
our determination of the relative fair values of these elements is based on the relative amounts of the fees we charge our customers for the product licenses and service elements  as set forth in each of the applicable contracts 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in revenues by line item were as follows in millions  except percentages year ended december  change versus versus royalties and licenses services and other total revenues royalties and licenses we generally derive royalties from the sale of set top boxes and other products that incorporate our software 
royalties are typically paid by either the network operator or the set top box manufacturer depending upon our payment arrangements with those customers  and we have historically recognized revenues through one time royalty payments or ongoing license fees 
we recognize royalties upon receipt of royalty reports reflecting unit shipments or activation of our software by network operators or manufacturers 
royalty reports are generally received one quarter in arrears 
for non refundable prepaid royalties  we recognize revenues upon initial delivery of the software to our customers 
we also license our technology and services indirectly through distribution arrangements with key partners other than network operators and set top box manufacturers  such as conditional access vendors  who pay the applicable license and royalty fees directly to us on behalf of the network operator or set top box manufacturer 
we have also entered into license agreements with network operators who pay us under a subscription based model pursuant to which we are paid a monthly fee for each set top box that is shipped or deployed commercially by the network operator for so long as that box remains in use by the network operator 
we expect to continue offering this licensing model in the future and expect to derive a greater percentage of our revenues from subscriber based fees 
the aggregate amount of royalties we receive from our customers during a quarterly period is influenced by a number of factors 
in the case of our set top box software  these include initial deployments by new customers  the activation of new subscribers by existing customers  the shipment of additional set top boxes as replacements for older or defective set top boxes or for purposes of simply upgrading existing set top boxes  and sales of new products or services by the network operators that require new or updated set top boxes 
we have historically provided various types of prospective volume discounts on optional future deployments of our licensed middleware products based on the volume of the customer s previous deployments of the particular licensed products  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
unless we are able to offset anticipated discounts through a change in product mix  upgrades to our software or other methods which enable us to charge higher fees  we may experience slower royalty growth as discounting is triggered 
a significant portion of our revenues is dependent upon our customers subscriber base  the growth in their subscriber base  and the related quantities of set top boxes deployed with our software 
specific royalty trends 
table of contents associated with set top box deployments by our customers are difficult to discern in many cases as we do not control or directly influence actual deployment schedules of our customers 
however  our general experience in the past suggests that set top box deployments by our customers tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year  though many factors  such as the general economic climate and the specific financial condition of our customers  can influence the actual level of set top box deployments at any given time 
because we receive most of our royalty reports one quarter in arrears  our royalty revenues in the past have generally been higher in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year  though our revenues in and beyond may be negatively impacted if our customers reduce deployments of our products due to the recent deterioration in worldwide economic conditions 
we also derive fees from the licensing of other software products  such as opentv streamer  our campaign management solution known as eclipseplus  and opentv participate 
these license fees can be in the form of one time  upfront payments by our customers  the total of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  or can be in the form of a recurring license fee  the total of which is less likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
royalties and licenses revenues by region were as follows in millions  except percentages year ended december  change versus versus europe  middle east and africa americas asia pacific total royalties and licenses revenues as percentage of total revenues versus royalties and licenses revenues in increased million  or  to million 
europe  middle east and africa accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenue in  a decrease of million  or  as compared to bskyb  directly and indirectly through our set top box manufacturer customers who sell set top boxes to bskyb  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenues for bskyb royalties and licenses revenues increased by million compared to  primarily as a result of increased deployments by bskyb of our pvr software 
we typically generate higher royalty rates from set top boxes that include our pvr software  and we generally expect the number of pvr shipments to increase over time as network operators around the world seek to deploy more pvr functionality 
royalties and licenses revenues from upc broadband holdings  or ugc  decreased million in as compared to during the fourth quarter of  we amended some of the commercial and other terms of our license agreement with ugc and  in addition  delivered the final remaining licensed products  which allowed us to recognize million of revenue from deferred revenue that has been deferred since in addition  during ugc maintained an inventory of set top boxes containing our software  which negatively impacted new shipments to this customer for which we would receive royalties 
we expect the impact of inventory levels at ugc on our royalties and licenses revenues to diminish beginning in royalties and licenses revenues from sky italia increased million as compared to  primarily due to an increase in set top box deployments by this customer 
royalties and licenses revenues from multichoice africa increased million as compared to  primarily due to a recent upgrade by this customer to our latest opentv core middleware product and increased deployments of set top boxes containing this product 
the remaining decrease in royalties and licenses revenues of million resulted from lower volumes of deployments of our products by other customers 

table of contents the americas region accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenue in  consistent with echostar  including dish network and echostar technologies llc  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenues for royalties and licenses revenues from echostar declined million as compared to  primarily due to reduced deployments by dish network of set top boxes containing our software  as well as the receipt of a late royalty report from echostar during the first quarter of for set top boxes that were shipped during royalties and licenses revenues from bell tv formerly bell expressvu in canada decreased million as compared to this decrease was primarily due to an amendment to our license agreement with bell tv entered into during the first quarter of that converted the pricing model from an upfront royalty to a recurring subscription fee per set top box  payable over the term of the customer s use of the set top box incorporating our middleware 
we expect the cumulative per set top box subscription fees paid by bell tv over the expected period of use of the set top box to more than compensate for the relative difference between the amount of the prior upfront royalty and the recurring subscription fee 
these reductions in royalties and licenses revenues were partially offset by increased royalties and licenses revenues from net in brazil of million  as compared to  reflecting increased deployments of middleware related products by this customer  and an increase of million in license fees resulting from increased deployments by our customers of our advertising campaign management product 
royalties and licenses revenues from other customers in the region accounted for a net increase of million compared to due to higher volumes of deployments of our products 
the asia pacific region accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenues in  an increase of million  or  as compared to royalties and licenses revenues from reliance in india  which we started to receive in through our license and distribution agreement with nagravision  totaled million in and was comprised of royalty payments and a one time license fee for our enterprise software 
royalties and licenses revenues from austar in australia increased million in as compared to  primarily due to the receipt of a late royalty report during the first quarter of for set top boxes that were shipped during but not previously reported to us

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in royalties and licenses revenues from other customers of million  resulting from lower volumes of deployments by such customers 

table of contents the americas region accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenues in  a decrease of million  or  compared to echostar  including dish network and echostar technologies corporation  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenues in echostar royalties and licenses revenues declined million as compared to due to reduced set top box shipments and a reduction in amortization of deferred royalties as compared to our revenues had included the amortization of historic royalty payments we had received from echostar  which were being amortized over the original seven year term of the middleware license agreement 
the middleware license agreement is currently renewable on an annual basis  and we now amortize revenues from echostar over the applicable one year renewal term 
royalties and licenses revenues from bell tv in canada declined million as compared to  primarily as a result of an amendment to our license agreement with bell tv entered into during the first quarter of that converted the pricing model from an upfront royalty to a recurring subscription fee per set top box 
these reductions in royalties and licenses revenues were partially offset by increased royalties and licenses revenues from net in brazil of million  as compared to  reflecting increased deployments of our middleware products as well as an increase of million from increased deployment of our advertising campaign management solution in the united states 
royalties and licenses revenues from other customers in the region accounted for a net decrease of million compared to due to lower volumes of deployments of our products 
the asia pacific region accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenues in  an increase of million  or  compared to royalties and licenses revenues from jcom increased million due to additional deployments of our video on demand products by jcom beginning in the second quarter of sales of our opentv integrated browser product increased million in  as compared to  reflecting increased device sales by our customers 
increased royalty revenues from foxtel  for whom we first started recognizing revenues from middleware shipments during the second quarter of  accounted for an increase of million in these increases were partially offset by the one time recognition of million in license revenues from partitv during pursuant to a contract that was terminated in the third quarter of royalties and licenses revenues from other customers accounted for a net decrease of million due to fewer deployments of our products 
services and other services and other revenues are primarily generated from professional services  maintenance and support  training  service usage fees  revenue sharing arrangements  and programming fees 
professional services revenues are generally derived from deployment and integration consulting engagements for network operators  set top box manufacturers  and systems integrators 
service usage fees and revenue sharing arrangements were historically derived from our playmontecarlo gaming channel  which was sold in the fourth quarter of  and from revenue sharing arrangements for our advertising and other interactive services 
we also derived programming fees in from our nascar service agreement  which was not renewed for the season  and from other programmers 
maintenance and support and training revenues are generally realized as services are provided to network operators and set top box manufacturers 
a set top box manufacturer s decision to purchase maintenance and support from us depends largely on whether such manufacturer is actively shipping set top boxes with our software or reasonably expects to do so in quantities large enough to justify payment of these amounts  which  in both cases  is dependent upon such manufacturer s supply contracts with network operators and set top box demand by the network operator

business segment results in march  nigel ben bennett was appointed as chief executive officer after having served as chief operating officer and acting chief executive officer since august accordingly  mr 
bennett is our chief operating decision maker  or codm 
as part of a management change in august  we reorganized our reporting units in an effort to provide management with better information for allocating the company s resources and assessing performance in accordance with the new management team s strategic focus 
our codm currently assesses our results and financial performance and reviews our internal budgeting reports on the basis of two segments middleware solutions and advertising solutions 
we have prepared this segment analysis in accordance with sfas  and accordingly  we have restated the segment information for the prior periods presented in our financial statements 
middleware solutions is composed of set top box middleware and embedded browser technologies  such as opentv spyglass and integrated browser  as well as software components that are deployed at the network operator s headend 
advertising solutions has included our opentv eclipseplus  eclipse and advision products  our playjam business  our nascar service and related technologies  our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel  and our opentv participate product 
beginning in  we ceased operating our nascar service and our playmontecarlo betting and gaming channel 
in december  we sold static  which operated our playjam games business 
in accordance with sfas  the financial results of our playjam games business have been reclassified as a discontinued operation in our financial statements for all periods presented 
our management reviews and assesses the contribution margin of each of these segments  which is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
we define contribution margin for these purposes as segment revenues less related direct or indirect allocable costs  including personnel and personnel related support costs  communications  facilities  maintenance and support  consulting and subcontractor costs  travel  marketing and network infrastructure and bandwidth costs 
there are significant judgments management makes with respect to the direct and indirect allocation of costs that may affect the calculation of contribution margins 
while management believes these and other related judgments are reasonable and appropriate  others could assess such matters differently 
contribution margin is a non gaap financial measure that excludes unallocated corporate support  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets  share based compensation  impairment of goodwill  impairment of intangibles  other income  minority interest  restructuring provisions  and unusual items 
table of contents such as contract amendments that mitigate potential loss positions 
these exclusions reflect costs not considered directly allocable to individual business segments and result in a definition of contribution margin that does not take into account some of the substantial costs of doing business 
management believes that segment contribution margin is a helpful measure in evaluating the performance of our business segments 
while our management may consider contribution margin to be an important measure of comparative operating performance  this measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  profit loss from operations  net income loss  cash flow and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap that are presented in our financial statements 
in addition  our calculation of contribution margin may be different from  and not comparable to  the calculation used by other companies 
because these segments reflect the manner in which management reviews our business  they necessarily involve judgments that management believes are reasonable in light of the circumstances under which they are made 
these judgments may change over time or may be modified to reflect new facts or circumstances 
segments may also be changed or modified to reflect technologies and applications that are newly created  or that change over time  or other business conditions that evolve  each of which may result in reassessing specific segments and the elements included within each of those segments 
recent events may affect the manner in which we present segments in the future

we expect the impact of inventory levels at ugc on our royalties and licenses revenues to diminish beginning in royalties and licenses revenues from echostar  including dish network and echostar technologies llc  decreased million as compared to the decrease was primarily due to reduced deployments by dish network of set top boxes containing our software  as well as the receipt of a late royalty report from echostar during the first quarter of for set top boxes that were shipped during royalties and licenses revenues from jcom in japan decreased million compared to as the prior year period included a royalty prepayment for deployments of our video on demand product

we expect the cumulative per set top box subscription fees paid by bell tv over the expected period of use of the set top box to more than compensate for the relative difference between the amount of the prior upfront royalty and the recurring subscription fee

table of contents deferred revenue when we apply our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred  principally in accordance with sop  sop and sab in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future product and services deliverables and the appropriate valuation for those deliverables 
some of our contractual arrangements with our customers involve multiple elements that impact the timing of recognition of revenues received from such customers  including  for example  our arrangements with essel group which operates the dishtv network in india  foxtel in australia and comcast and time warner in the united states 
at the time that a multiple element arrangement is entered into  we make a determination as to whether vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for each of the elements involved in the arrangement 
to the extent vsoe does not exist for any undelivered elements  then all or portions of the amounts that we invoice under the applicable arrangement are generally deferred and recognized as revenue over time 
for example  some of our arrangements provide for the delivery of future specified products and services  for which vsoe of fair value does not exist 
in addition  some of our contracts include maintenance and support offerings  for which vsoe of fair value does not exist 
in instances where vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support does not exist  we will generally recognize all revenues from the arrangement either over the remaining contractual period of support or over the remaining period during which maintenance and support is expected to be provided  once all other specified deliverables have been delivered 
in instances where vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support exists and there are future specified products and services for which vsoe of fair value does not exist  we will generally recognize all revenues upon the final delivery of the future specified products and services  except for the fair value of the revenues relating to the remaining undelivered maintenance and support  which will be recognized over the remaining period of support 
as of december   we recorded a balance of million in deferred revenue compared with million as of december  based on our current estimates  we expect the following recognition of this deferred revenue balance in millions year ending december  expected recognition of deferred revenue thereafter in order to determine the expected recognition of deferred revenue set forth in the foregoing table  we make judgments and estimates regarding  among other things  future product and services deliverables  the appropriate valuation of those products and services and expected changes in customer requirements 
these judgments and estimates could differ from actual events  particularly those that involve factors outside of our control 
as a result  the actual revenue recognized from these arrangements and the timing of that recognition may differ from the amounts identified in this table 
while management believes that this information is a helpful measure in evaluating the company s performance  investors should understand that unless and until the company is actually able to recognize these amounts as revenue in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that the conditions to recognizing that revenue will be satisfied 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to be able to fund our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using existing cash balances and short term and long term marketable debt securities if our assumptions about 
table of contents our revenues  expenses and cash commitments are generally accurate 
because we cannot be certain that our assumptions about our business or the interactive television and advertising solutions markets in general will prove to be accurate  our funding requirements may differ from our current expectations 
our primary source of cash from operations is royalty payments from customers 
the primary uses of cash are personnel and personnel related costs  subcontractor and consulting costs  facilities costs  and capital expenditures 
in february  we received million in cash from liberty media after the expiration of the indemnity period specified in the stock purchase agreement between liberty media and kudelski 
the mix of cash and short term and long term investments may change in the future as we make decisions regarding the composition of our investment portfolio 
we use professional investment management firms to manage a significant portion of our invested cash 
the portfolio consists of highly liquid  high quality investment grade securities of the united states government and agencies  corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit that predominantly have maturities of less than three years

commitments and contractual obligations information as of december  concerning the amount and timing of required payments under our contractual obligations is summarized below in millions total due in due in due in due in or after operating leases obligations noncancellable purchase obligations total contractual obligations we have the right to terminate  without penalty  one of our operating leases prior to its scheduled expiration 
if we exercised this early termination right in  our future minimum lease commitments would be reduced by an aggregate of million over the current remaining life of that lease 
we have not yet made any determination as to whether we intend to exercise such right 
if we did exercise such right  while our commitments under this specific lease would be reduced  we might also be required to lease additional space to conduct our business and we cannot be certain at this time whether any such actions would possibly result in a net increase in our future minimum lease commitments 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners for marketing and other services 
future minimum commitments under these arrangements as of december  were million for the year ending december   and insignificant for the years ending december  and in addition  we also have arrangements with certain parties that provide for revenue sharing payments 
as of december   we had three standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million  two of which were issued to landlords of our leased properties  and one of which was issued to a sublessee at our 
table of contents new york facility  which we vacated in the second quarter of we pledged two certificates of deposit aggregating approximately million  which were included under short term marketable debt securities  as collateral in respect of these standby letters of credit 
indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we provide indemnification to customers  subject to limitations  against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
costs related to these indemnification provisions are sometimes difficult to estimate 
while we have not historically experienced significant costs for these matters  there may be occasions in the ordinary course of our business where we assume litigation and other costs on behalf of our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial position 
we ordinarily seek to limit our liability in these indemnification arrangements in various respects  including monetarily  but the costs associated with any type of intellectual property indemnification arrangement can be significant  particularly in the technology sector 
as permitted under the laws of the british virgin islands  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks 
this exposure relates to our holdings of fixed income investment securities and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fixed income investment risk we own a fixed income investment portfolio with various holdings  types and maturities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of the balance sheet line item titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
most of these investments consist of a diversified portfolio of highly liquid united states dollar denominated debt securities classified by maturity as cash equivalents  short term investments or long term investments 
these debt securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
our investment policy limits the maximum maturity of securities in this portfolio to three years and weighted average maturity to months 
although we expect that market value fluctuations of our investments in short term debt obligations will not be significant  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
alternatively  a sharp decline in interest rates could have a material positive effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposures 
our investment policy limits investment concentration in any one issuer other than with respect to united states treasury and agency securities and also restricts this part of our portfolio to investment grade obligations based on the assessments of rating agencies 
there have been instances in the past where the assessments of rating agencies have failed to anticipate significant defaults by issuers 
it is possible that we could lose most or all of the value in an individual debt obligation as a result of a default 
a loss through a default may have a material impact on our earnings even though our policy limits investments in the obligations of a single issuer to no more than five percent of the value of our portfolio 

table of contents the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our portfolio of investment securities with original maturities greater than days as of december  using a model that assumes immediate sustained parallel changes in interest rates across the range of maturities in thousands fair value as of december  valuation of securities if interest rates decrease valuation of securities if interest rates increase valuation of securities if interest rates decrease valuation of securities if interest rates increase marketable debt securities the modeling technique used in the above table estimates fair values based on changes in interest rates assuming static maturities 
the fair value of individual securities in our investment portfolio is likely to be affected by other factors including changes in ratings  market perception of the financial strength of the issuers of such securities and the relative attractiveness of other investments 
accordingly  the fair value of our individual securities could also vary significantly in the future from the amounts indicated above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
we incur a substantial majority of our expenses  and earn most of our revenues  in united states dollars

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during the year ended december   we did not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  options in hedging foreign currency exposures  or other hedging procedures 
however  we regularly assess our foreign currency exchange rate risk that results from our global operations  and we may in the future elect to make use of appropriate hedging strategies
