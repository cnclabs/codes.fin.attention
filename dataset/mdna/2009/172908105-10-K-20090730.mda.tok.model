results of operation the economic environment in fiscal presented challenges not experienced in decades 
the financial crisis which began in september   caused many of our customers to immediately reduce spending 
as the economic turmoil continued  we saw our customers make dramatic reductions in spending 
significant job losses in the us and canada followed the financial crisis  as these economies lost millions of jobs from october   through may  the suddenness and severity of the economic downturn required us to react quickly to reduce our cost structure 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we closed two manufacturing plants in kentucky  initiated hiring and wage freezes in many parts of the organization  eliminated many overhead positions and reduced discretionary and capital spending 
these initiatives resulted in a reduction to selling and administrative expenses of approximately million when comparing the last six months of fiscal to the first six months of fiscal in addition to the actions described above  we initiated restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce excess capacity and further reduce our cost structure 
these activities included closing or converting to branches of our rental processing plants and reducing our workforce by  employees 
we 
table of contents expect these restructuring activities to be completed by may  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges of million in long lived asset impairment costs  million in employee termination costs and million in other exit costs for a total of million that will be incurred as a result of this restructuring

cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower revenue levels in all operating segments other than document management services 
the significant deterioration of the us and canadian economies  particularly in the last five months of the year ended may   which led to reduced revenue levels in our rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment  our uniform direct sales operating segment and our first aid  safety and fire protection services operating segment  created excess inventory levels in these operating segments
