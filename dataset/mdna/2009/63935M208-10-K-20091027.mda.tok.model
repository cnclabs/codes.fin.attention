all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements and may contain information about financial results  economic conditions  trends and known uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  which include those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report under item a risk factors and the risks discussed in our other filings with the sec 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof

overview we provide our services to customers typically pursuant to agreements with a term of one to five years and monthly payment installments 
as a result  these agreements provide us with a base of recurring revenue 
our revenue increases by adding new customers or selling additional services to existing customers 
our overall base of recurring revenue is affected by new customers  renewals or terminations of agreements with existing customers 
a large portion of the costs to operate our data centers such as rent  product development and general and administrative expenses does not depend strictly on the number of customers or the amount of services we provide 
as we add new customers or new services to existing customers  we generally incur limited incremental costs relating to telecommunications  utilities  hardware and software costs and payroll expenses 
we have substantial capacity to add customers to our data centers 
our relatively fixed cost base  sufficient capacity for expansion and limited incremental variable costs provide us with the opportunity to grow profitably 
however  these same fixed costs present us with the risk that we may incur losses if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue 
our fiscal year ends on july of each year 
during fiscal year  we completed four acquisitions 
in august we acquired the outstanding capital stock of jupiter a privately held company based in santa clara  california  that provides managed hosting services and acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of alabanza 
alabanza was a provider of dedicated and shared managed hosting services 
in september we acquired the outstanding capital stock of netaspx  an application management service provider  and in october we acquired the assets of icommerce  a reseller of dedicated hosting services 
all of the acquisitions during fiscal year were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  as such  the results of operations and cash flow related to these acquisitions were included in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows from their respective dates of acquisition

selling and marketing expense increased to approximately million  or of total revenue for the fiscal year ended july   from approximately million  or of total revenue for the fiscal year ended july  the increase of approximately million resulted primarily from increased commission and referral partner expenses of million and an increase of million related to advertising expense

the increased expenses were offset by lower transaction related costs of million  lower salary costs including stock based compensation of million and a net decrease in depreciation and amortization of million 

table of contents loss on settlement 
during fiscal year we entered into a settlement agreement with a former jupiter customer to settle all pending litigation matters between us 
we recorded a loss on settlement of million  comprised of a million cash settlement payment to this former customer and the write off of million of outstanding accounts receivable from this former customer  which accounts receivable were written off as part of this settlement 
impairment  restructuring and other 
during fiscal year we initiated the restructuring of our professional services organization in an effort to realign resources 
as a result of this initiative  we terminated several employees  resulting in a restructuring charge for severance and related costs of million  of which approximately million was included in operating expenses 
no impairment  restructuring or other charges were recorded in fiscal year we recorded a net impairment recovery of million in fiscal primarily due to an impairment recovery of approximately million related to revised assumptions due to securing a sublease of an impaired facility during the fiscal year ended july   offset by an approximate million impairment charge related to the abandonment of additional space in our syracuse  new york  facility 
interest income interest income decreased  to approximately  for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease is mainly due to lower levels of average cash balances during the year ended july   as compared to the fiscal year ended july  interest income decreased to approximately  or of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended july   from approximately  or of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease of  is mainly due to lower levels of average cash balances during the year ended july   as compared to the fiscal year ended july   as a result of our use of cash for acquisitions during fiscal year interest expense interest expense increased to approximately million  or of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended july   from approximately million  or of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended july  the increase of million is primarily related to an increased rate of interest and higher average outstanding debt balances during the fiscal year ended july  interest expense decreased to approximately million  or of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended july   from approximately million  or of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease of million is primarily related to a lower rate of interest on our outstanding long term debt during the fiscal year ended july  the average long term debt balance during the fiscal year ended july   compared to the fiscal year ended july   was higher due to an increase in the term loan balance as a result of the debt refinancing in june and the acquisitions completed in the first quarter of fiscal year loss on debt extinguishment no loss on debt extinguishment was recorded during the fiscal year ended july  during the fiscal year ended july   we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of million in connection with the september refinancing of our credit agreement 
the total amount of the loss on debt extinguishment consisted of the write off of unamortized transaction fees and expenses related to the prior refinancing of our long term debt in june 
table of contents other income expense  net other income was approximately million for the fiscal year ended july   as compared to other income of approximately million for the fiscal year ended july  other income consists of sublease rental income and other miscellaneous income 
other income was approximately million for the fiscal year ended july   as compared to other income of approximately million for the fiscal year ended july  other income consists of a million gain attributed to the settlement of the appliedtheory litigation coupled with million for sublease rental income and other miscellaneous income 
income tax expense we recorded million of deferred income tax expense for the fiscal year ended july  deferred income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended july   was consistent with that recorded in the fiscal year ended july   and million more than the amounts recorded for the fiscal year ended july  no income tax benefit was recorded for the losses incurred due to a valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax expense resulted from tax goodwill amortization related to the surebridge asset acquisition in june  the acquisition of certain appliedtheory corporation assets by cbtm prior to the pooling of interests in december  the asset acquisition of alabanza in september and the asset acquisition of icommerce in october accordingly  the acquired goodwill and intangible assets for these acquisitions are amortizable for tax purposes over years 
for financial statement purposes goodwill is not amortized for any of these acquisitions but is tested for impairment annually 
tax amortization of goodwill results in a taxable temporary difference  which will not reverse until the goodwill is impaired or written off 
the resulting taxable temporary difference may not be offset by deductible temporary differences currently available  such as net operating loss carryforwards  which expire within a definite period 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and a revolving credit facility of million provided under our credit agreement with a lending syndicate 
at july   we had borrowed million under the revolving credit facility 
our current assets  including cash and cash equivalents of million  were approximately million less than our current liabilities at july   as compared to a positive working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  at july  cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million for the fiscal year ended july  our primary sources of cash included approximately million in cash provided by operations and million in proceeds from borrowings on notes payable 
net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the fiscal year ended july   resulted from the funding of our net loss of million  non cash charges of million and million in net changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary uses of cash for the fiscal year ended july   included million to purchase property  plant and equipment  million paid in respect of notes payable and capital lease obligations  and million of payments for debt issuance costs 
at july   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revolving credit facility allows for maximum borrowing of million and expires in june outstanding amounts bear interest at either libor plus or  at our option  the base rate  as defined in our credit agreement  plus 
there is an additional accruing as pik interest until the leverage ratio has been lowered to interest becomes due  and is payable  quarterly in arrears 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and existing amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated under various capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
future minimum annual rental commitments under capital and operating leases and other commitments  as of july   are as follows less than more than description total year years years years in thousands short long term debt interest on debt a capital leases b bandwidth commitments property leases b c d total a interest on debt assumes that libor is fixed at and that our leverage ratio drops below as of january   resulting in a interest rate decrease 
the accruing pik interest will be paid in full at the end of the loan term 
b future commitments denominated in foreign currency are fixed at the exchange rates as of july  c amounts exclude certain common area maintenance and other property charges that are not included within the lease payment 
d on february   we entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with a las vegas based company  whereby this company purchased from us the right to use  square feet in our las vegas data center and the infrastructure and equipment associated with this space 
in exchange  we received an initial payment of  and were to receive  per month over two years 
on may   we received full payment of the remaining unpaid balance 
this agreement shifts the responsibility for management of the data center and its employees  along with the maintenance of the facility s infrastructure  to this las vegas based company 
pursuant to this agreement  we have subleased back  square feet of space  allowing us to continue servicing our existing customer base in this market 
commitments related to property leases include an amount related to the  square foot sublease 
off balance sheet financing arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases  which are recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in accordance therewith  we must make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  stock based compensation  impairment costs  and income taxes 
we review our estimates on a regular basis and make adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
we perform these reviews regularly and make adjustments in light of currently available information 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from monthly fees for website and internet application management and hosting  co location services and professional services 
reimbursable expenses charged to 
table of contents customers are included in revenue and cost of revenue 
revenue is recognized as services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria 
application management  hosting and co location services are billed and recognized as revenue over the term of the applicable contract based on actual customer usage 
these terms generally are one to five years 
installation fees associated with application management  hosting and co location services are billed when the installation service is provided and recognized as revenue over the term of the related contract 
installation fees generally consist of fees charged to set up a specific technological environment for a customer within a navisite data center 
in instances where payment for a service is received in advance of performing those services  the related revenue is deferred until the period in which such services are performed 
the direct and incremental costs associated with installation and setup activities are capitalized and expensed over the term of the related contract 
professional services revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis as the services are performed for time and materials type contracts or on a percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
we estimate the percentage of completion using the ratio of hours incurred on a contract to the projected hours expected to be incurred to complete the contract 
estimates to complete contracts are prepared by project managers and reviewed by management each month 
when current contract estimates indicate that a loss is probable  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
contract losses are determined as the amount by which the estimated service costs of the contract exceed the estimated revenue that will be generated by the contract 
historically  our estimates have been consistent with actual results 
unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue for services performed that have not been billed 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when more than one element such as professional services  installation and hosting services are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on acceptable fair value allocation methodologies  so long as each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the fair value of each undelivered element is determined  if sold separately  by the price charged or  if not sold separately  by other acceptable objective evidence 
we apply judgment to ensure the appropriate application of eitf  including with respect to the determination of fair value for multiple deliverables  the determination of whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements and the timing of revenue recognition  among others 
for those arrangements with respect to which the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables is treated as one accounting unit and generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
existing customers are subject to initial and ongoing credit evaluations based on credit reviews that we perform and  subsequent to beginning as a customer  payment history and other factors  including the customer s financial condition and general economic trends 
if it is determined  subsequent to our initial evaluation at any time during the arrangement  that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized as cash is received  as collectability is not considered probable at the time the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform initial and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historical bad debts  customer and industry concentrations  customer creditworthiness including the customer s financial performance and its business history  current economic trends and changes in our customers payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for of the balance of customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
for all other customer accounts  we reserve as needed based upon management s estimates of uncollectible amounts based on historical bad debt 
changes in economic conditions or the financial viability of our customers may result in additional provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of our current estimate 
historically  our estimates have 
table of contents been consistent with actual results 
a to unfavorable change in our provision requirements would result in an approximate million to million decrease to income from operations for the fiscal year ended july  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets  subject to amortization and depreciation  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
long lived and other intangible assets include customer lists  customer contract backlog  developed technology  vendor contracts  trademarks  non compete agreements and property and equipment 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the use and disposal of the asset are less than its carrying value and therefore impaired  we recognize the impairment loss as measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or values determined by reference to third party valuation reports  depending on the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value  less disposal costs 
property and equipment is primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment and software licenses 
we review the valuation of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis  if it is considered more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires us to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance 
we operate in highly competitive environments  and our projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results 
if the assumption that we use in preparing our estimates of our reporting units projected performance for purposes of impairment testing differs materially from actual future results  we may record impairment changes in the future and our operating results may be adversely affected 
we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill as of july   and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
no impairment indicators have arisen since that date to cause us to perform an impairment assessment since that date 
at july  and  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
historically  our estimates have been consistent with actual results 
impairment costs 
we generally record impairments related to underutilized real estate leases 
generally  whenever we determine that a facility will no longer be utilized or generate any future economic benefit  we record an impairment loss in the period such determination is made 
as of july   our accrued lease impairment balance totaled approximately million  all of which represents amounts that are committed under remaining contractual obligations 
these contractual obligations principally represent future obligations under non cancelable real estate leases 
impairment estimates relating to real estate leases involve the consideration of a number of factors  including potential sublet rental rates  the estimated vacancy period for the property  brokerage commissions and certain other costs 
estimates relating to potential sublet rates and expected vacancy periods are most likely to have a material impact on our results of operations if actual amounts differ significantly from estimates 
these estimates involve judgment and uncertainties  and the settlement of these liabilities could differ materially from recorded amounts 
as such  in the course of making such estimates  we often use third party real estate professionals to assist us in our assessment of the marketplace for purposes of estimating sublet rates and vacancy periods 
historically  our estimates have been 
table of contents consistent with actual results 
a to unfavorable settlement of our remaining liabilities for impaired facilities  as compared to our current estimates  would decrease our income from operations for the fiscal year ended july   by approximately million to million 
stock based compensation 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we had measured options granted prior to august   as compensation cost in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  no accounting recognition is given to stock options granted at fair market value until they are exercised 
upon exercise of the options  net proceeds  including tax benefits realized  are credited to equity 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for the periods prior to august   we established estimates for forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended july  and  included compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted before  but unvested as of  july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation expense for the stock based payment awards granted after july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we use the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model 
in utilizing the black scholes model  we are required to make certain estimates in order to determine the grant date fair value of equity awards 
these estimates can be complex and subjective and include the expected volatility of our common stock  our divided rate  a risk free interest rate  the expected term of the equity award and the expected forfeiture rate of the equity award 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of our recorded stock based compensation 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  using the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
sfas no 
also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this methodology is subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and in the calculation of certain tax liabilities 
at july  and  respectively  a valuation allowance has been recorded against the gross deferred tax asset since we believe that  after considering all the available objective evidence positive and negative  historical and prospective  with greater weight given to historical evidence it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
in each reporting period  we evaluate the adequacy of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
in the future  if we can demonstrate a consistent trend of pre tax income  then  at that time  we may reduce our valuation allowance accordingly 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards at july   totaled million 
a reduction in our current valuation allowance on these federal and state net 
table of contents operating loss carryforwards would result in an income tax benefit of approximately million for the reporting period 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several tax jurisdictions 
we are periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  we record estimated reserves for exposures 
based on our evaluation of current tax positions  we believe that we have appropriately accrued for exposures 
recent accounting pronouncements in september the fasb s emerging issues task force issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting as well as how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the new guidance also requires enhanced financial statement disclosures 
we are currently assessing the impact that eitf will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in november the sec issued for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb 
under the proposed roadmap  we could be required in fiscal to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs  and the sec will make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
we are currently assessing the impact that this change would have on our consolidated financial statements  and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs

however  under our senior secured credit facility  we are required to maintain interest rate protection to effectively limit the unadjusted variable component of the interest costs of our facility with respect to not less than of the principal amount of all indebtedness  as defined  at a rate that is acceptable to the lending group s agent 
our exposure to market risk associated with risk sensitive instruments entered into for purposes other than trading purposes is not material 
we currently have limited foreign operations and therefore face no material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our interest rate risk at july   was limited mainly to libor on our outstanding loan under our senior secured credit facility 
at july   we had no open derivative positions with respect to our borrowing arrangements 
because our loan s libor related rate is fixed above libor a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would have resulted in no increase in our interest expense under our senior secured credit facility for the fiscal year ended july
