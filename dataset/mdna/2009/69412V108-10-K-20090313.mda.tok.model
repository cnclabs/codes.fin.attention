summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
management believes that the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered critical under the sec definition allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balances of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations  or liquidity 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had  in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis of the intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of december    and share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based forms of compensation issued to employees 
this standard became effective in the first quarter of the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to measure fair value under sfas r which is further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
therefore  previously reported financial data was not restated  and expenses related to equity based payments granted and vesting during   and were recorded as compensation expense 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
th quarter compared to th quarter two tables follow which analyze the changes in net interest income for the fourth quarter and fourth quarter table i average balance analysis of net interest earnings  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
the bank s net interest margin for the fourth quarter was compared to for the fourth quarter table i shows that earning asset yields for the fourth quarter of were down basis points from fourth quarter earning asset yields due primarily to a basis point decline in the yield on net loans 
the decline in loan yields was due to the rapid decline in market interest rates during  which lowered yields on the bank s variable rate loan portfolio 
however  the bank s practice of including floors on most of its variable rate loans mitigated additional declines in loan yields during this falling rate environment 
during the third and fourth quarters  loan yields stabilized due to the activation of interest rate floors on approximately  of the bank s variable rate loan portfolio  thus protecting the net interest margin 
table i shows that the rates paid on interest bearing core deposits moved down faster than yields on earning assets as evidenced by the basis point decline from to 
in addition  the cost of alternative funding has moved down at a faster rate than core deposits  down basis points from to 
this rapid fall in the cost of alternative funding was due to a planned strategy to maintain a relatively short maturity structure on the bank s alternative funding  which permitted the bank to refinance this funding at consistently lower rates during a rapidly declining interest rate environment 
overall  the cost of interest bearing liabilities of the bank  which includes both core deposits and alternative funding  has fallen by basis points in fourth quarter from fourth quarter table i also shows the difference between the cost of interest bearing core deposits and alternative funding 
overall  interest bearing core deposits have a rate of or basis points lower than alternative funding costs at 
however  this spread between core deposit rates and alternative funding rates has compressed significantly during the last half of when compared to the first half of the year when this spread ranged between and basis points 
this narrowing spread is again the result of the relatively short maturity structure of the bank s alternative funding  federal reserve actions to lower rates during the fourth quarter  and the relatively high cost of core deposits in a very competitive rate environment 
table ii shows the changes in net interest income due to rate and volume for the quarter ended december  interest income including loan fees for the fourth quarter declined by from the same period last year 
higher volumes of earning assets increased interest income by  while lower yields on earning assets  primarily loans  decreased interest income by  the rate volume analysis shows that interest expense for the quarter ended december  decreased by  from last year  as changes in mix and higher volumes caused interest expense to increase by  which was more than offset by a decrease in interest expense of  due to lower rates 
most of the decline in interest expense was due to lower rates and was in the bank s core deposit base  which illustrates the bank s ability to quickly reprice its core deposits 
in addition  the bank also benefited from the short maturity structure of its alternative funding  which permitted refinancing at lower rates in a rapidly falling interest rate environment

table iv  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
the net interest margin for the full year was  a decline of basis point from the net interest margin reported for the year table iii shows that earning asset yields declined by basis points for the year when compared to from to 
the decline in earning assets yields was due primarily to the basis point drop in yields on loans  which resulted from the rapidly declining interest rate environment experienced throughout that lowered yields on the bank s variable rate loan portfolio 
as noted above  the bank s use of interest rate floors on its variable rate loan portfolio mitigated further decline in loan yields during the last half of table iii also shows the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year was down basis points from in to in this decline can be also be attributed to the falling rate environment during  plus the relatively short maturity structure of the bank s alternative funding  which permitted rapid refinancing of funding at much lower rates throughout the year

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in  in  and in the increase in the provision for when compared to was due to loan growth  moderate deterioration in credit quality  and an increase in unallocated reserves in light of significant economic uncertainty 
the increase in the provision for when compared to was due to loan growth and some increased economic uncertainty

nonperforming assets do not include  of impaired loans less than days past due and continuing to accrue interest as of december  at december   approximately  of the nonaccrual loans were consumer residential construction loans 
other real estate owned consisted of completed consumer construction residential properties and seven individual residential building lots 
losses on these or any future nonperforming loans in the consumer residential construction segment of the loan portfolio are mitigated due to a cash secured principal guarantee for each of these loans 
in addition  no special allocation to the allowance for loan losses for these specific loans is expected 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was  of outstanding loans  net of loans held for sale compared to  of loans and  of loans at years end and  respectively 
at december   the bank also has reserved for possible losses on unfunded loan commitments  which is classified in other liabilities

noninterest income noninterest income is derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  income derived from mortgage banking services  and gains on the sale of loans 
compared to noninterest income in was  up or from the  reported for the year the increase in noninterest income when compared to was primarily attributable to a increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a increase in other fee income  principally bankcard processing fee income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased due to lower earnings credit rate  which increased fees on analyzed business accounts 
bankcard processing fee income accounted for of this increase 
increases in these categories were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking income 
the decline in mortgage banking income was attributable to a significant slow down in the residential housing market 
the other income category in was  an or decrease from the reported in the other income category for the year the decrease in the other income category was due to collection of approximately in loan referral fees during the year compared to noninterest income in was  down or from the  reported for the year excluding the one time gain of on the sale of property included in results  noninterest income in was down or from the following discussion excludes the effect of the gain on sale of property in the decline in noninterest income when compared to was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income

total salary expense was up  or and benefits and taxes were up or over last year 
approximately of the increase in salary expense was due to lower loan origination costs  which are a direct offset to salary expense 
higher benefits and taxes expense in resulted from increased group insurance  and accruals for officer incentives 
the other expense category accounted for the majority of the remaining increase in noninterest expense in over other expenses were  in  up or over other expenses of  the increase in the other expense category can be attributed to the following areas increased fdic assessment of  increased travel expense of  increased other real estate expense of due to increases in other real estate owned  and increased repossession and collection expense of related to increases in non performing loans

 decrease decrease eugene market portland market seattle market total the seattle market was primarily responsible for the majority of the growth in outstanding loans for the company during  but both the portland and eugene markets also showed solid year over year loan growth 
the growth in all three markets can be attributed to increased commercial real estate lending and loans to dental professionals throughout the year  combined with a lessening of competition for loans 
throughout  many financial institutions experiencing credit quality problems and significantly reduced their lending activities  thus increasing the opportunity for the bank to grow its loan portfolio

 decrease decrease eugene market core deposits portland market core deposits seattle market core deposits total core deposits other deposits total outstanding core deposits at december  in all three markets were virtually flat from one year ago primarily due to the highly competitive environment for these deposits with other financial institutions in all three of the bank s primary markets 
this increased competition for core deposits  primarily based on price  was driven by liquidity problems experienced by the entire industry during the last six months of as financial markets experienced significant disruption 
in addition  core deposit growth was affected by a deterioration in economic conditions in all three markets that negatively impacted the cash flow  and thus the deposit levels of many of the bank s existing clients 
as a result of no growth in core deposits  the bank experienced growth of more than  in other deposits  which consisted primarily of brokered and public time deposits 
junior subordinated debentures the company had  in junior subordinated debentures at december   which were issued in conjunction with the acquisition of nwbf 
at december   the entire  in junior subordinated debentures had an interest rate of that is fixed through november as of december   the entire balance of the junior subordinated debentures qualified as tier capital under regulatory capital purposes

capital resources capital is the stockholders investment in the company 
capital grows through the retention of earnings and the issuance of new stock through the exercise of stock options 
capital formation allows the company to grow assets and provides flexibility in times of adversity 
stockholders equity at december  was  an increase of  or from december  the increase in stockholders equity during was due to the retention of approximately  net income for the year and the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefit accounted for another  the federal reserve board and the fdic have in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
these guidelines require a minimum of total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
the regulations also specify that a total risk based capital ratio is required to be designated well capitalized the highest fdic capital rating by the fdic 
the company s tier i capital  which consists of stockholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill net of the deferred tax associated with goodwill  and deposit based intangibles  totaled  at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i and tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was  at december  the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  at december  compared to at december  subsequent to year end december   the company raised approximately  of additional capital through a private equity placement of thousand shares of stock at per share

in january  the company announced it had determined not to participate in this program 
the company pays cash dividends on a quarterly basis  typically in march  june  september and december of each year 
the board of directors considers the dividend amount quarterly and takes a broad perspective in its dividend deliberations including a review of recent operating performance  capital levels  and concentrations of loans as a percentage of capital  and growth projections 
the board also considers dividend payout ratios  dividend yield  and other financial metrics in setting the quarterly dividend 
the company declared and paid cash dividends of per share for the year that compares to dividends of per share for the year when adjusted for the stock dividend paid in june the board of directors  at its february  meeting  approved a dividend of per share for stockholders of record as of march  if continued for each quarter during  this would result in no change in dividends over dividends 
the company projects that earnings retention and existing capital will be sufficient to fund anticipated organic asset growth  while maintaining a well capitalized designation from all regulatory agencies 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments in the normal course of business  the bank commits to extensions of credit and issues letters of credit 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to lend funds and conditional obligations as it does for other credit products 
in the event of nonperformance by the customer  the bank s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract 
since some commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december   the bank had  in commitments to extend credit 
letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
at december   the bank had  in letters of credit and financial guarantees written 
the bank also has internal guidance lines of credit established for certain borrowers  primarily in the residential construction industry 
these guidance lines are not contractual commitments to extend credit  and may be terminated by the bank for any reason without any obligation to the borrower 
these lines provide the bank s lenders limits on future extensions of credit to certain borrowers 
the bank uses the same credit policies in establishing internal guidance lines as it does for other credit products 
at december   the bank had established unused and uncommitted guidance lines totaling approximately  compared to unused and uncommitted guidance lines of  at december  the company has certain other financial commitments 
these future financial commitments are outlined below contractual obligations dollars in thousands total less than one year years years more than years junior subordinated debenture fhlb borrowings federal reserve borrowings time deposits operating lease obligations liquidity liquidity is the term used to define the company s ability to meet its financial commitments 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds 
the company derives liquidity through core deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments 
core deposits include demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits  including local time deposits in excess of additional liquidity and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans  sales of securities  access to national cd markets  and both secured and unsecured borrowings 
the company uses a number of measurements to monitor its liquidity position on a daily  weekly  and monthly basis 
during the third and fourth quarters of during significant disruption of financial markets that created liquidity problems for a number of financial institutions  the company heightened its liquidity monitoring and also put into place a number of programs to increase its core deposit base  including deposit promotions in all three markets 
core deposits at december  were of total deposits compared to at december  core deposits at december  were virtually flat with one year ago due to increased competition for core deposits by all financial institutions  combined with deteriorating economic conditions 
loan growth was funded primarily through alternative funding sources  including overnight borrowed funds  federal home loan bank advances  federal reserve bank of san francisco advances  public deposits available from the state of oregon and state of washington  national market time deposits  and brokered time deposits 
the company has deposit relationships with several large clients  which are closely monitored by bank officers 
at december   large deposit relationships with the bank account for  or of total deposits 
the single largest client represented of total deposits at december  the loss of this deposit relationship or other large deposit relationships could cause an adverse effect on short term liquidity 
the company expects to maintain these relationships and believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity to mitigate the loss of one or more of these clients 
borrowing lines have been established at various correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank of seattle and with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
at december   the bank had secured and unsecured borrowing lines totaling approximately  consisting of  with the federal home loan bank of seattle   with various correspondent banks  and  with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the federal home loan bank borrowing line is limited to the amount of collateral pledged 
at december   the bank had collateral pledged to the fhlb in the form of commercial real estate loans  first and second lien single family residential loans  multi family loans  and mortgage backed securities that had a discounted collateral value of approximately  for this line 
the  borrowing line with the federal reserve bank of san francisco is also secured through the pledging of commercial loans under the bank s borrower in custody program 
the  in borrowing lines with correspondent banks is unsecured 
at december   the bank had  in borrowings outstanding from the fhlb of seattle and  outstanding on its overnight correspondent bank lines  and  outstanding with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
in addition  the bank is part of the state of oregon and state of washington community bank time deposit program and at december  had approximately available from these sources 
the bank s loan portfolio also contains approximately  in guaranteed government loans  which can be sold on the secondary market 
subsequent to the end of the year  as a result of a financial institution failure in the state of washington  the bank was assessed thousand for uninsured public deposits at the failed institution 
the assessment was based upon the bank s pro rata share of public deposits as of december   which amounted to less than one tenth of one percent 
however  due to the increased risk of future bank failures in washington  the bank chose to exit the public deposit pool in order to minimize its exposure to possible assessments for uninsured deposits 
the bank will continue to have a potential liability for uninsured deposits for a period of one year following its exit from the state public deposit pool 
inflation substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has not changed significantly 
the effects of this inflation have not had a material impact on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
although permitted by its funds management policy  the company does not presently use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
in addition to the interest rate shock analysis  the company also prepares a rolling four quarter forecast of the balance sheet and income statement using a flat rate scenario ie rates unchanged and a most likely rate scenario where rates are projected to change based on management s analysis of expected economic conditions and interest rate environment 
this analysis takes into account growth in loans and deposits and management strategies that could be employed to maximize the net interest margin and net interest income 
the company utilizes in house asset liability modeling software  profitstar to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in a parallel shift of the yield curve in basis point increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability  and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
during the first six months of  the model indicated that the company was asset sensitive and projected rising margins in a rising rate environment 
however during the last six months of and at december   the profit star model showed the company had become liability sensitive  meaning that in a rising rate environment  the net interest margin and net interest income would decline 
the change in the company s interest rate risk position was due primarily to the activation of floors on approximately  of variable rate loans  combined with the relatively short maturity structure of the company s alternative funding 
the following table shows the estimated impact of interest rate changes plus basis points and minus basis points on net interest income in basis point increments 
the base figure of  used in the analysis differs from actual net interest income for due to instruments being priced at offering rates  factoring in run off assumptions 
due to the various assumptions used for this modeling and potential balance sheet strategies management may implement to mitigate interest rate risk  no assurance can be given that projections will reflect actual results
