item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operations we are a leading  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari mutuel properties 
we currently own or operate nineteen facilities in fifteen jurisdictions  including colorado  florida  illinois  indiana  iowa  louisiana  maine  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  new mexico  ohio  pennsylvania  west virginia  and ontario 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
in  we began our transition from a pari mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the charles town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in west virginia 
since  we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions  including the acquisitions of hollywood casino bay st 
louis and boomtown biloxi  crc holdings  inc  the bullwhackers properties  hollywood casino corporation  argosy gaming company argosy  black gold casino at zia park  and sanford orlando kennel club 
the vast majority of our revenues is gaming revenue  derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and  to a lesser extent  table games 
other revenues are derived from our management service fee from casino rama  our hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities  and our racing operations 
our racing revenue includes our share of pari mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers  our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting  and our share of wagering from our off track wagering facilities otws 
we intend to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties and the continued pursuit of strategic acquisitions of gaming properties  particularly in attractive regional markets 
key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle volume indicator  table game drop volume indicator and win or hold percentages 
our typical property slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow  since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive  and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund capital maintenance expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions

in may  the illinois legislature passed into law house bill  effective may   which singled out four of the nine illinois casinos  including our empress casino hotel and hollywood casino aurora  for a tax surcharge to subsidize local horse racing interests 
on may   empress casino hotel and hollywood casino aurora joined with the two other riverboats affected by the law  harrah s joliet and the grand victoria casino in elgin  and filed suit in circuit court of the twelfth judicial district in will county  illinois the court  asking the court to declare the law unconstitutional 
empress casino hotel and hollywood casino aurora began paying the tax surcharge into a protest fund which accrues interest during the 
table of contents pendency of the lawsuit  and have subsequently expensed approximately million in incremental tax  including million during the year ended december  in two orders dated march  and april   the court declared the law unconstitutional under the uniformity clause of the illinois constitution and enjoined the collection of this tax surcharge 
the state of illinois requested  and was granted  a stay of this ruling

we are continuing to build and develop several of our properties  including argosy casino lawrenceburg and empress casino hotel 
additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures below 
critical accounting policies we make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change 
we have identified the policies related to the accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and litigation  claims and assessments as critical accounting policies  which require us to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosures  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million within our consolidated balance sheet  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the 
table of contents factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
as a result of a decline in our share price  an overall reduction in industry valuations  and property operating performance in the current economic environment  we believed that there were indicators of impairment as of december  as a result  we tested our long lived assets for impairment as of december   and determined that a portion of the value of our long lived assets  primarily at our bullwhackers property  was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million million  net of taxes during the year ended december  for these assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets within our consolidated balance sheet  representing and of total assets  respectively  resulting from our acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and racing permits 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions  projections for future operations  and data obtained from third party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate 
goodwill is tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment test is performed to determine the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit 
if the implied value is less than the carrying amount for that reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized for that reporting unit 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  we consider our gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization 
rather  these intangible assets are tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amounts of the gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
we use a market approach model  with ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  charges for stock compensation  impairment loss  depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on disposal of assets  merger termination settlement fees  net of related expenses  and other expense  and inclusive of loss from joint venture multiples  as we believe that ebitda is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry and as we use ebitda as the primary measurement of the operating performance of our properties including the evaluation of operating personnel 
in addition  we believe that an ebitda multiple is the principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies 
changes in the estimated ebitda multiple or forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that 
table of contents have a definite life  including the management service contract for casino rama  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
as a result of a decline in our share price  an overall reduction in industry valuations  and property operating performance in the current economic environment  we believed that there were indicators of impairment as of december  as a result  we tested our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as of december   and determined that a portion of the value of these assets was impaired in certain reporting units 
accordingly  we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million million  net of taxes and million million  net of taxes during the year ended december  for our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  respectively 
income taxes at december   we had a net deferred tax liability balance of million within our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of sfas  on january  fin creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at december   we had a liability relating to fin of million  which is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet at december  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents results of operations the following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance the fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets 
as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties  jurisdictional expansions such as the recent openings in pennsylvania and maine and property expansion in under penetrated markets 
the actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways 
for instance  the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in addition  government bodies may restrict  prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business such as through the illinois  colorado and pennsylvania smoking bans that became effective on january  
the fact that a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance  in maryland and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as in kansas  maryland  ohio  and kentucky 
the timing and occurrence of these events remain uncertain 
we also face uncertainty regarding anticipated gaming expansion by one of our competitors in baton rouge  louisiana 
legalized gaming from casinos located on native american lands can also have a significant competitive effect 
the continued demand for  and our emphasis on  slot wagering entertainment at our properties 
the successful expansion at empress casino hotel and argosy casino lawrenceburg

in addition  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from acquisitions of gaming properties at reasonable valuations  greenfield projects  jurisdictional expansions and property expansion in under penetrated markets 
if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future or undertake any significant property expansions  our cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to make additional borrowings or complete equity or debt financings to meet these requirements 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control
