item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and highlights we are a commercial lender that provides financial products to middle market businesses  and  through our wholly owned subsidiary  capitalsource bank  provides depository products and services in southern and central california 
we currently operate as three reportable segments commercial banking  healthcare net lease  and residential mortgage investment 
our commercial banking segment comprises our commercial lending and banking business activities  our healthcare net lease segment comprises our direct real estate investment business activities  and our residential mortgage investment segment comprises our remaining residential mortgage investment and other investment activities in which we formerly engaged to optimize our qualification as real estate investment trust reit 
for financial information about our segments  see note  segment data  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  through our commercial banking segment activities  we provide a wide range of financial products to middle market businesses and participate in broadly syndicated debt financings for larger businesses 
as of december   we had  loans outstanding under which we had funded an aggregate of billion and held a billion participation in a pool of commercial real estate loans the a participation interest 
within this segment  capitalsource bank also offers depository products and services in southern and central california that are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to the maximum amounts permitted by regulation 
through our healthcare net lease segment activities  we invest in income producing healthcare facilities  principally long term care facilities in the united states 
we provide lease financing to skilled nursing facilities and  to a lesser extent  assisted living facilities  and long term acute care facilities 
as of december   we had billion in direct real estate investments comprising healthcare facilities leased to tenants through long term  triple net operating leases 
we currently intend to evaluate all potential transactions to monetize the value of this business including debt financings  asset sales and corporate transactions 
through our residential mortgage investment segment activities  we invested in certain residential mortgage assets and other reit qualifying investments to optimize our reit structure through as of december   our residential mortgage investment portfolio totaled billion  which included investments in residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage backed securities rmbs  including related interest receivables 
over of our investments in rmbs were represented by mortgage backed securities that were issued and guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac hereinafter  agency rmbs 
in addition  we hold mortgage related receivables secured by prime residential mortgage loans 
during the first quarter of  we sold all of our agency rmbs and we intend to merge the remaining assets currently in this segment into our commercial banking segment in in our commercial banking  and healthcare net lease segments  we have three primary commercial lending businesses healthcare and specialty finance  which generally provides first mortgage loans  asset based revolving lines of credit  and cash flow loans to healthcare businesses and  to a lesser extent  a broad range of other companies 
we also make investments in income producing healthcare facilities  particularly long term care facilities  corporate finance  which generally provides senior and subordinate loans through direct origination and participation in syndicated loan transactions  and structured finance  which generally engages in commercial and residential real estate finance and also provides asset based lending to finance companies 
although we have made loans as large as million  as of december   our average commercial loan size was million and our average loan exposure by client was million 
our commercial loans generally have a maturity of one to five years with a weighted average maturity of years as of december  substantially all of our commercial loans require monthly interest payments at variable rates and  in many cases  our commercial loans provide for interest rate floors that help us maintain our yields when interest rates are low or declining 
we price our loans based upon the risk profile of our clients 
as of december   our geographically diverse client base consisted of clients with headquarters in states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and select international locations  primarily in canada and europe 
bank holding company application consistent with the business plan approved by our regulators  we are pursuing our strategy of converting capitalsource bank to a commercial bank and becoming a bank holding company 
to date we have obtained approvals from the dfi and fdic to convert capitalsource bank from an industrial bank to a california commercial bank 
for the conversion to become effective  we must be approved by the federal reserve as a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of we filed our bank holding company application with the board of governors of the federal reserve in october that application is being processed by the federal reserve bank of richmond and has not been approved at this time 
we are cooperating with the federal reserve in providing access to such information as is needed to make its decision on the pending application 
we believe that becoming a commercial bank will allow capitalsource bank to offer a wider variety of deposit products and services to customers  however  we cannot assure you that the federal reserve will approve our application in which case capitalsource bank would not convert to a commercial bank 
current guidance from the us treasury department provides that  since capitalsource inc did not obtain approval as a bank holding company prior to december   capitalsource inc is not eligible to obtain funding under the capital assistance program cap or the capital purchase program 
although capitalsource bank has applied for cap funding  there is no assurance that capitalsource bank will be able to obtain cap funding or that it would accept the funding if offered 
impact of economic recession the us economy is currently in a recession 
consequently  we expect that the credit performance of our portfolio will continue to decline in light of the current difficult economic conditions that are likely to adversely affect our clients ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
in addition  the recession has generally had a disproportionately adverse impact on financial institutions  including a substantial reduction in liquidity  greater pricing for risk and de leveraging 
in our commercial banking segment  macroeconomic conditions have also adversely impacted our business through reduced funding alternatives and a higher cost of funds on our credit facilities  term debt and other borrowings as measured by a spread to one month libor 
we expect to continue to experience higher costs and less advantageous terms for financing the parent company s portfolio which will continue to negatively impact our liquidity 
financing the parent company s portfolio has recently become more challenging as our lenders have sought to reduce their exposure to us 
to maintain our financings  we have agreed to less favorable terms  including collateralizing our previously unsecured credit facility and agreeing to repay it more rapidly 
as a result of these less favorable terms  as well as other factors  our liquidity has been materially adversely affected and may continue to worsen 
you should carefully read the liquidity and capital resources portion of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more details on the factors adversely affecting our current and expected liquidity and our plans to address them 
capitalsource bank  however  has significantly diversified and strengthened our funding and  with the addition of a significant amount of deposits  reduced our cost of funds overall 
we believe current economic conditions present significant near term market opportunities for capitalsource bank to originate assets with increased spreads and tighter structures and to selectively purchase high quality assets or businesses at attractive prices 
with the liquidity and lower cost of funds at capitalsource bank  we believe we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of the attractive opportunities we perceive in the current environment 
consolidated results of operations we currently operate as three reportable segments commercial banking  healthcare net lease  and residential mortgage investment 
our commercial banking segment comprises our commercial lending and banking business activities  our healthcare net lease segment comprises our direct real estate investment business activities  and our residential mortgage investment segment comprises our residential mortgage investment and other investment activities in which we formerly engaged to optimize our qualification as a reit 
from january  to the third quarter of  we presented financial results through two reportable segments commercial lending investment and residential mortgage investment 
our commercial lending investment segment comprised our commercial lending and direct real estate investment business activities and our residential mortgage investment segment comprised all of our activities related to our investments in residential mortgage loans and rmbs 
in the fourth quarter of  we began presenting financial results through three reportable segments commercial finance  healthcare net lease  and residential mortgage investment 
changes were made in the way management organizes financial information to make operating decisions  resulting in the activities previously reported in the commercial lending investment segment being disaggregated into the commercial finance segment and the healthcare net lease segment as described above 
beginning in the third quarter of  we changed the name of our commercial finance segment to commercial banking to incorporate depository products  services and investments of capitalsource bank 
we have reclassified all comparative prior period segment information to reflect our three reportable segments 
for financial information about our segments  see note  segment data  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the discussion that follows differentiates our results of operations between our segments 
explanation of reporting metrics interest income 
in our commercial banking segment  interest income represents interest earned on our commercial loans  the a participation interest  marketable securities  other investments and cash and cash equivalents 
although the majority of these loans charge interest at variable rates that generally adjust daily  we also have a number of loans charging interest at fixed rates 
interest on capitalsource bank investments is primarily derived from agency discount notes and agency callable debt obligations 
in our healthcare net lease segment  interest income represents interest earned on cash and restricted cash 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  interest income consists of coupon interest and the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums on our investments in rmbs and mortgage related receivables  which are amortized into income using the interest method 
fee income 
in our commercial banking segment  fee income represents net fee income earned from our commercial loan operations 
fee income primarily includes the amortization of loan origination fees  net of the direct costs of origination  prepayment related fees as well as other fees charged to borrowers 
operating lease income 
in our healthcare net lease segment  operating lease income represents lease income earned in connection with our direct real estate investments 
our operating leases typically include fixed rental payments  subject to escalation over the life of the lease 
we generally project a minimum escalation rate for the leases and recognize operating lease income on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
we currently do not generate any operating lease income in our commercial banking segment or our residential mortgage investment segment 
interest expense 
interest expense is the amount paid on deposits and borrowings  including the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt discounts 
in our commercial banking segment  interest expense includes interest paid to depositors and the borrowing costs associated with repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
in our healthcare net lease segment  our borrowings consist of mortgage debt and allocated intercompany debt 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  our borrowings consist of repurchase agreements and term debt 
the majority of our borrowings charge interest at variable rates based primarily on one month libor or commercial paper cp rates plus a margin 
currently  our convertible debt  three series of our subordinated debt  our term debt recorded in connection with our investments in mortgage related receivables and the intercompany debt within our healthcare net lease segment bear a fixed rate of interest 
deferred financing fees  debt discounts and the costs of issuing debt  such as commitment fees and legal fees  are amortized over the estimated life of the borrowing 
loan prepayments may materially affect interest expense on our term debt since in the period of prepayment the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt acquisition costs is accelerated 
provision for loan losses 
we record a provision for loan losses in both our commercial banking segment and our residential mortgage investment segment 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses inherent in our commercial lending portfolio and in our portfolio of residential mortgage related receivables 
as the size and mix of loans within these portfolios change  or if the credit quality of the portfolios change  we record a provision to appropriately adjust the allowance for loan losses 
we do not have any loan receivables in our healthcare net lease segment 
other income 
in our commercial banking segment  other expense income consists of gains losses on the sale of loans  gains losses on the sale of debt and equity investments  unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  gains losses on derivatives  due diligence deposits forfeited  unrealized appreciation depreciation of our equity interests in certain non consolidated entities  third party servicing income  income from our management of various loans held by third parties and other miscellaneous fees and expenses not attributable to our commercial lending and banking operations 
in our healthcare net lease segment  other expense consists of gain loss on the sale of assets 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  other expense consists of realized and unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain of our residential mortgage investments and gains losses on derivatives that are used to hedge the residential mortgage investment portfolio 
operating expenses 
in our commercial banking segment  operating expenses include compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  rent  insurance  depreciation and amortization  marketing and other general and administrative expenses 
in our healthcare net lease segment  operating expenses include depreciation of direct real estate investments  professional fees  an allocation of overhead expenses including compensation and benefits and other direct expenses 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  operating expenses include an allocation of overhead expenses  compensation and benefits  professional fees paid to our investment manager and other direct expenses 
income taxes 
we elected reit status under the internal revenue code the code when we filed our tax return for the year ended december  we operated as a reit through  but revoked our reit election effective january  while a reit  we generally were not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed to our shareholders that we derived from our reit qualifying activities  but were subject to corporate level tax on the earnings we derived from our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 
while a reit  a significant portion of our income from our commercial banking segment remained subject to corporate level income tax as many of the segment s assets were originated and held in our trss 
operating results for the years ended december   and our results of operations in were driven primarily by the global recession  a challenging credit market environment and the impact of operating as a reit 
as further described below  the most significant factors influencing our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   compared to were commencement of capitalsource bank operations  increased provision for loan losses  gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  increased balance of our commercial lending portfolio  mark to market losses on our residential mortgage investment portfolio  gains and losses on derivatives and other investments in our commercial banking segment  increased operating expenses  changes in lending and borrowing spreads  and reduced prepayment related fee income and reduced gains on equity sales 
our consolidated operating results for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   were as follows year ended year ended december  december  change change change change in thousands in thousands interest income fee income operating lease income interest expense provision for loan losses depreciation of direct real estate investments other operating expenses other expense income noncontrolling interests expense income tax benefit expense cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes n a n a net loss income our consolidated yields on income earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and  were as follows year ended december  weighted net average weighted net average average investment yield average investment yield balance income cost balance income cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total direct real estate investments total income earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net finance spread net finance margin interest earning assets include cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  marketable securities  mortgage related receivables  rmbs  loans  the a participation interest and investments in debt securities 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits  repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
operating expenses the increase in consolidated operating expenses in from was primarily due to a million increase in professional fees  including a write off of previously capitalized costs related to a terminated merger transaction  fees related to the previously planned initial public offering of capitalsource healthcare reit  consulting fees and legal and other professional fees related to the formation and commencement of operations of capitalsource bank  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from increases in depreciation on our direct real estate investments and depreciation on capitalsource bank s fixed assets  a million increase in rent and marketing expense related to capitalsource bank and a million increase in other administrative expenses 
these increases were primarily offset by a million decrease in total employee compensation and a million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses 
the decrease in employee compensation was primarily due to a million decrease in incentive compensation partially offset by a million increase in salaries 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation comprises annual bonuses  as well as expense attributed to stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units  which generally have vesting periods ranging from months to five years 
the increase in consolidated operating expenses in from was primarily due to a million increase in total employee compensation and an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from increases in our direct real estate investments over the previous year 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to a million increase in incentive compensation  including an increase in restricted stock awards  and a million increase in employee salaries 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation comprises annual bonuses  as well as stock options and restricted stock awards  which generally have vesting periods ranging from eighteen months to five years 
the remaining increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a million increase in administrative expenses and a million increase in rent expense 
income taxes as a result of our decision to elect reit status beginning with the tax year ended december   we provided for income taxes for the years ended december  and  based on effective tax rates of and  respectively  for the income earned by our trss 
we did not provide for any income taxes for the income earned by our qualified reit subsidiaries for the years ended december  and we provided for income taxes on the consolidated income earned based on a  and effective tax rates in  and  respectively 
our overall effective tax for the year ended december  included the reversal of million in net deferred tax liabilities relating to reit qualifying activities  into income  in connection with our reit election 
we revoked our reit election effective january  as a result of our reit revocation  we have recorded a million in deferred tax benefit and a million in net deferred tax asset on our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  comparison of the years ended december  and we have reclassified all comparative prior period segment information to reflect our three reportable segments 
the discussion that follows differentiates our results of operations between our segments 
all references to commercial loans below include loans  loans held for sale and receivables under reverse repurchase agreements 
commercial banking segment our commercial banking segment operating results for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   were as follows year ended december  change change in thousands interest income fee income interest expense provision for loan losses operating expenses other expense income  net income tax benefit expense net loss income includes noncontrolling interest expense 
interest income the decrease in interest income was primarily due to an increase in non accrual loans and a decrease in yield on average interest earning assets 
during the year ended december   yield on average interest earning assets decreased to compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the interest component of yield to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in the interest component of yield was due to a decrease in short term interest rates and lower yield on the a participation interest  partially offset by an increase in our core lending spread 
during the year ended december   our core lending spread to average one month libor was compared to for the year ended december  fluctuations in yields are driven by a number of factors  including changes in short term interest rates such as changes in the prime rate or one month libor  the coupon on new loan originations  the coupon on loans that pay down or pay off and modifications of interest rates on existing loans 
fee income the decrease in fee income was primarily the result of a decrease in prepayment related fee income  which totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  prepayment related fee income contributed and to yield for the years ended december  and  respectively 
yield from fee income  including prepayment related fees  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  interest expense we fund our growth largely through debt and deposits 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the addition of interest expense on deposits from our banking operations 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in our cost of funds 
our cost of funds decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in our cost of funds was the result of lower libor rates on which interest on our term securitizations and credit facilities are based and lower cost of deposits 
the increase in interest expense was also the result of higher borrowing spreads and higher restructuring fees on certain of our term securitizations and credit facilities  and increases in the cost of our convertible debt following the exchange offer completed in april and our issuance in july of our senior subordinated convertible notes due net finance margin net finance margin  defined as net investment income which includes interest and fee income less interest expense divided by average income earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from the year ended december  the decrease in net finance margin was primarily due to the decrease in yield on total income earning assets  a decrease in short term market rates of interest such as libor upon which the yield of many of our loans are based  partially offset by a decrease in our costs of funds as measured by a spread to short term market rates of interest such as libor 
net finance spread  which represents the difference between our gross yield on income earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest and fee income divided by our average income earning assets 
the decrease in net finance spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
the yields of income earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities in our commercial banking segment for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  weighted net average weighted net average average investment yield average investment yield balance income cost balance income cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net finance spread net finance margin interest earning assets include cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  marketable securities  the a participation interest  loans  and investments in debt securities 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits  repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
provision for loan losses the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to an increase in the overall policy reserve levels due to a change in reserve factors to reflect higher estimated inherent losses due to the current economic environment  increase in specific reserves and charge offs due to increase in loan delinquencies as well as some modest change in the portfolio balance and mix during the year ended december  operating expenses the increase in operating expenses is due to the same factors which contributed to the increase in the consolidated operating expenses as described above 
operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  other expense income the decrease in other expense income was primarily attributable to a million decrease in net realized and unrealized gains in our equity investments  a million increase in losses related to our reo  a million impairment loss recorded for goodwill at the parent company  a million decrease in gains on the sale of loans  a million decrease in income relating to our equity interest in various investees that are not consolidated for financial statement purposes and a million increase in losses relating to mark to market adjustments on our loans held for sale 
these decreases were partially offset by a million gain on the extinguishment of debt  a million increase in foreign currency gains and a million decrease in losses on derivative instruments 
our unrealized losses on derivative instruments were primarily due to the unrealized net change in the fair value of swaps used in hedging certain of our assets and liabilities to minimize our exposure to interest rate movements 
we do not apply hedge accounting to these swaps and  as a result  changes in the fair value of such swaps are recognized in gaap net income  while changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposures are not

residential mortgage investment segment portfolio composition we directly own residential mortgage investments and as of december  and  our portfolio of residential mortgage investments was as follows december  in thousands mortgage related receivables residential mortgage backed securities agency non agency total represents secured receivables that are backed by adjustable rate residential prime mortgage loans 
see following paragraph for a description of these securities 
while we were a reit  we invested in rmbs  which are securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans 
agency rmbs are mortgage backed securities issued and guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
non agency rmbs are rmbs issued by non government sponsored entities that are credit enhanced through the use of subordination or in other ways that are inherent in a corresponding securitization transaction 
substantially all of our rmbs are collateralized by adjustable rate residential mortgage loans  including hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans 
we account for our agency rmbs as debt securities that are classified as trading investments and included in mortgage backed securities pledged  trading on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets 
we account for our non agency rmbs as debt securities that are classified as available for sale and included in investments on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets 
the coupons on the loans underlying rmbs are fixed for stipulated periods of time and then reset annually thereafter 
the weighted average net coupon of agency rmbs in our portfolio was as of december   and the weighted average reset date for the portfolio was approximately months 
the weighted average net coupon of non agency rmbs in our portfolio was as of december  the fair values of our agency rmbs and non agency rmbs  including accrued interest  were billion and million  respectively  as of december  during the first quarter of  we sold all of our agency rmbs and we intend to merge the remaining assets currently in this segment into our commercial banking segment in as of december   we had billion in mortgage related receivables secured by prime residential mortgage loans 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on these receivables was  and the weighted average contractual maturity was approximately years 
see further discussion on our accounting treatment of mortgage related receivables in note  mortgage related receivables and related owner trust securitizations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the carrying value of certain of our residential mortgage investments decreased by as the market dislocation impacted the pricing relationship between mortgage assets including agency rmbs that we own and lower risk fixed income securities 
our investment strategy explicitly contemplated the potential for upward and downward shifts in the carrying value of the portfolio  including shifts of the magnitude that we saw during during  volatility in the residential mortgage market increased 
to reduce our exposure to this market volatility  during the year ended december   we sold agency rmbs with a face value of billion  realizing a gain of million as a component of loss gain on residential mortgage investment portfolio in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of income 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses as of december  and  mortgage related receivables  whose underlying mortgage loans are or more days past due or were in the process of foreclosure and foreclosed were as follows december in thousands mortgage related receivables whose underlying mortgage loans are or more days past due or in the process of foreclosure percentage of mortgage related receivables mortgage loans or more days past due are also placed on non accrual status

see market risk management below for a discussion of our interest rate risk management program related to our residential mortgage investment portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our sources of funds available to meet our obligations as they arise 
we require cash to fund new and existing commercial loan commitments  repay indebtedness  make new investments  fund net deposit outflows and pay expenses related to general business operations 
our sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  new borrowings and deposits  proceeds from asset sales including sales of loans and loan participations  principal  interest and lease payments and additional equity and debt financing 
as a de novo bank  capitalsource bank is prohibited from paying dividends during its first three years of operations without consent from our regulators 
prior to july  we do not anticipate that dividends from capitalsource bank will provide any liquidity to fund the operations of the parent company 
consequently  we separately manage the liquidity of capitalsource bank and the parent company 
our liquidity forecasts indicate that we have adequate liquidity to conduct our business 
these forecasts are based on our business plans for the parent company and capitalsource bank and assumptions related to expected cash inflows and outflows that we believe are reasonable  however  we cannot assure you that our forecasts or assumptions will prove to be accurate  particularly in the current volatile environment 
some of our liquidity sources such as cash  deposits  borrowings on existing facilities and net cash from operations are generally available on an immediate basis 
other sources of liquidity  such as proceeds from asset sales and the ability to generate additional liquidity through new equity or debt financings  are less certain and less immediate  and are dependent on and subject to market and economic conditions and the willingness of counterparties to enter into new lending  sale or investment transactions with us 
accordingly  these sources of additional liquidity may not be sufficient or accessible quickly enough to meet our needs 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to any of these additional liquidity sources 
unless otherwise specified  the figures presented in the following paragraphs are based on current forecasts and take into account activity since december  the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with  and is subject to and qualified by  the information set forth under item a  risk factors  and the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
capitalsource bank liquidity forecast our liquidity forecast is based on our business plan to make all new commercial loans through capitalsource bank for the foreseeable future  and our expectations regarding the net growth in the commercial loan portfolio at capitalsource bank and the repayment of the a participation interest 
we intend to maintain sufficient liquidity at capitalsource bank through cash  investments in marketable securities  deposits and access to other funding sources to fund commercial loan commitments and operations as well as to maintain minimum ratios required by our regulators 
capitalsource bank is well capitalized  and we do not expect capitalsource bank will need either additional capital investments from us or to access external sources of financing including the capital assistance program  the capital purchase program or other similar government programs to meet its business plan 
capitalsource bank  however  may access external sources of financing if available on favorable terms or desirable for other corporate purposes  such as managing interest rate risk 
capitalsource bank uses its liquidity to fund new commercial loans and investments  to fund commitments on existing commercial loans fund net deposit outflows and to pay operating expenses  including  without limitation  intercompany payments to the parent company for origination and other services performed on its behalf 
capitalsource bank operates in accordance with the conditions imposed by its regulators in connection with regulatory approvals obtained upon its formation 
these approvals include  among others  requirements that capitalsource bank maintain a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  capital levels required for a bank to be considered well capitalized under relevant banking regulations  and a ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets of not less than for its first three years of operations 
in addition  we have a policy to maintain of capitalsource bank s assets in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
capitalsource bank s primary source of liquidity is deposits  substantially all of which are in the form of certificates of deposit cds 
we expect capitalsource bank to continue to generate sufficient deposits to meet its liquidity needs  including  as necessary  replacing maturing deposits and outflows on demand deposits 
at december   deposits at capitalsource bank were billion  which is approximately of the historical peak deposit levels of the branches before we acquired them 
we believe we will be able to maintain a sufficient level of deposits to fund capitalsource bank 
additional sources of liquidity for capitalsource bank include cash flows from operations  payments of principal and interest from loans and the a participation interest  cash equivalents and marketable securities  borrowings from the fhlb san francisco and reverse repurchase transactions 
we expect regular payments with respect to the a participation interest during  and that the a participation interest will be paid in full in cash receipts from these sources may reduce our need to maintain or increase deposits at capitalsource bank 
as of december   capitalsource bank had approximately billion of cash and cash equivalents and owned million in readily marketable securities 
as of december   the amount of capitalsource bank s unfunded commitments to extend credit with respect to existing loans was million 
due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace 
we anticipate that capitalsource bank will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy these unfunded commitments 
parent company liquidity forecast given the current dislocation in the capital markets  managing the parent company s liquidity has become increasingly challenging 
in prior periods  we maintained a higher level of cash and available liquidity under our credit facilities and were able to access the capital markets as an additional source of funds for the parent company 
in the current economic environment  the lack of liquidity in the capital markets means that we have very limited access to formerly available funding sources  and  consequently  our liquidity is lower than in prior periods 
the parent company s need for liquidity  however  is less than in prior periods because our business plan is to make all new commercial loans through capitalsource bank for the foreseeable future  and it is our expectation that the balances of our existing loan portfolio and other assets held in the parent company will be stable and run off over time 
in addition  based on existing and expected market conditions  we currently do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock at historical levels 
the parent company has an existing portfolio of commercial loans and other assets such as our mortgage related receivables and our direct real estate investments 
we intend to generate adequate liquidity at the parent company to cover our estimated funding obligations for commitments under existing commercial loans  to repay recourse indebtedness due in  and to pay operating expenses 
we anticipate generating some of this liquidity by utilizing means we have not regularly used in the past  including sales of loans  loan participations  real estate investments and real estate owned 
these sale activities are dependent on and subject to market and economic conditions and willing and able buyers entering into transactions with us and  therefore  are highly speculative 
furthermore  due to current market conditions  if we are able to consummate any asset sales we expect them to be at prices discounted to our current carrying value 
in some instances  proceeds from some of these activities are required to be used to make mandatory repayments on some of our indebtedness 
sources of liquidity for the parent company that we expect to be available include cash flows from operations  including  without limitation  principal  interest and lease payments  new borrowings under our credit facilities  loan sales to our a term debt securitization  long term financing of direct real estate investments through the us department of housing and urban development hud and other mortgage debt  asset sales  and tax refunds 
in the past we relied on consummating term debt transactions and our secured credit facilities to generate liquidity  but we do not expect these sources to be available to us for the foreseeable future 
our current forecast of significant cash outflows for the parent company includes an aggregate of million scheduled stepdown payments during the remainder of under our million syndicated bank credit facility  million in march to repurchase  as required  our outstanding convertible debentures due  funding of unfunded commitments on existing commercial loans  and mandatory repayments on our indebtedness resulting from some asset sales 
as of december   the amount of the parent company s unfunded commitments to extend credit with respect to existing loans exceeded unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by billion  an increase of million  or from december  due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
we expect that these unfunded commitments will continue to indefinitely exceed the parent company s available funds 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace 
in many cases  our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements  our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing  including compliance with all provisions of the loan agreements  and or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements 
in many other cases  however  there are no such prerequisites to future fundings by us and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time 
to the extent there are unfunded commitments with respect to a loan that is owned partially by capitalsource bank and the parent company  unless our client is in default  capitalsource bank is obligated in some cases pursuant to intercompany agreements to fund its portion of the unfunded commitment before the parent company is required to fund its portion 
in addition  in some cases we may be able to borrow additional amounts under our secured credit facilities as we fund these unfunded commitments 
pursuant to agreements with our regulators  to the extent capitalsource bank independently is unable to do so  the parent company must maintain capitalsource bank s total risk based capital ratio at not less than and must maintain the capital levels of capitalsource bank at all times to meet the levels required for a bank to be considered well capitalized under the relevant banking regulations 
we do not expect that our parent company will be required to fund amounts to capitalsource bank 
additionally  pursuant to requirements of our regulators  the parent company has provided a million unsecured revolving credit facility to capitalsource bank that capitalsource bank may draw on at any time it or the fdic deems necessary 
as of december   this facility was undrawn  and we do not expect that it will be drawn in  but there cannot be any assurance that the fdic will not require funding under this facility in the future 
we have continued to experience negative effects from the global economic recession and credit market disruption in the form of reduced commitments on our credit facilities  lower leverage and higher cost of funds on borrowings as measured by the spread to one month libor 
some of these negative effects were partially offset in through the sale by the parent company to capitalsource bank of billion of loans  and the parent company s use of the proceeds from such sales to significantly reduce indebtedness and commitments on our credit facilities 
we currently do not expect to obtain additional term securitization debt to finance our loans 
we are currently in discussions with our credit facility lenders to restructure our credit facilities to extend maturities and gain funding efficiencies 
if successful  we expect to see higher borrowing costs  potentially reduced committed capacity levels and or lower advance rates on our secured credit facilities 
we seek to complete a restructuring with our lenders during the second quarter of  but we cannot assure you that we will successfully restructure these facilities on favorable terms or at all 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
we invest cash on hand in short term liquid investments 
we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and  respectively 
the restricted cash consists primarily of principal and interest collections on loans collateralizing our term debt and on loans pledged to our credit facilities other than our syndicated bank credit facility and securities pledged as collateral to secure our repurchase agreements and related derivatives 
restricted cash also includes client holdbacks and escrows 
principal repayments  interest rate swap payments  interest payable and servicing fees are deducted from the monthly principal and interest collections funded by loans collateralizing our credit facilities and term debt  and the remaining restricted cash is returned to us and becomes unrestricted at that time 
deposits we completed the formation of capitalsource bank on july   which included the assumption of approximately billion in deposits from fil 
deposits gathered through retail bank branches are the primary source of funding for capitalsource bank  although capitalsource bank may have other sources of liquidity as outlined above 
as of december   we had deposits totaling billion 
for additional information about our deposits  see note  deposits  in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  borrowings as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings totaling billion and billion  respectively  under our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
for a detailed discussion of our borrowings  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  our maximum facility amounts  amounts outstanding and unused capacity  subject to certain minimum equity requirements and other covenants and conditions  as of december   were as follows maximum facility amount unused funding source amount outstanding capacity in thousands repurchase agreements credit facilities term debt other borrowings total excludes issued and outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of december  as of february   we had an aggregate maximum facility amount of billion and an aggregate of million of unused capacity 
we cannot borrow this unused capacity under these facilities without pledging additional eligible collateral 
we have limited available collateral to pledge to use this unused capacity 
however  such unused capacity may become available to us to the extent we have additional eligible collateral in the future 
as of december   approximately of our debt was secured by our assets and approximately was unsecured 
we intend to maintain prudent levels of leverage and currently expect our debt to equity ratio on the combined portfolios of our commercial banking segment and healthcare net lease segment to remain below x 
repurchase agreements as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under five master repurchase agreements with various financial institutions financing our purchases of rmbs and fhlb discount notes 
as of december  and  the aggregate amounts outstanding under such repurchase agreements were billion and billion  respectively 
as of december  and  these repurchase agreements had weighted average borrowing rates of and  respectively  and weighted average remaining maturities of month and months  respectively 
the terms of most of our borrowings pursuant to these repurchase agreements typically reset every days 
as of december  and  these repurchase agreements were collateralized by agency rmbs and fhlb discount notes with a fair value of billion and billion  respectively  including accrued interest  and cash deposits of million and million  respectively  made to cover margin calls 
as of february   we had repaid all outstanding amounts under our repurchase agreements 
credit facilities our committed credit facility amounts were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had six secured credit facilities with a total of financial institutions 
interest on our credit facility borrowings is charged at variable rates that may be based on one or more of one month libor  one month euribor or the applicable cp rate 
we use these facilities to fund assets and for general corporate purposes 
until  we financed many of our assets in our secured credit facilities until we completed term debt transactions in which we securitized pools of our assets from these facilities 
we primarily have used the proceeds from our term debt transactions to pay down our credit facilities  which resulted in increased capacity to redraw on them as needed 
through  the term debt markets in which we securitized our loan assets were inaccessible and we retained loan assets in our credit facilities or sold them to capitalsource bank 
we expect the term debt securitization markets to remain inaccessible throughout and possibly beyond 
as of december   our credit facilities commitments  principal amounts outstanding and maturity dates were as follows committed principal capacity outstanding in thousands cs iii secured credit facility scheduled to mature april  cs europe secured credit facility scheduled to mature september  cs vii secured credit facility scheduled to mature march  syndicated bank secured credit facility scheduled to mature march  cse qrs funding i secured credit facility scheduled to mature april  cs viii secured credit facility scheduled to mature july  total in february  we reduced the committed capacity to million 
in february  we reduced the committed capacity to million 
for the table above  the committed capacity of million is converted into us dollars at the prevailing spot rate as of december  on termination or maturity  amounts due under the credit facility may  in the absence of a default  be repaid from proceeds from amortization of the collateral pool 
the maturity date stated in the table above assumes utilization of a one year amortization period from the termination date 
as of february   we reduced the committed capacity to million 
in february  we reduced the committed capacity to million in december  we modified the terms of our billion unsecured credit facility to collateralize it with substantially all of the parent company s previously unencumbered assets  including loan assets  healthcare net lease properties  owned and purchased tranches of our term securitizations and our equity interest in capitalsource bank 
the amendment increased the margin above the applicable reference rate that we must pay on borrowings under the facility by an additional to 
we are required to make mandatory prepayments which are accompanied by commitment reductions in million increments with a portion of the proceeds of certain specified events  including a of the cash proceeds of any unsecured debt issuance by the parent company  b of the cash proceeds of specified equity issuances  and c of any principal repayments on  or the cash proceeds received on the disposition of or the incurrence of secured debt with respect to  assets constituting collateral under the facility 
regardless of any mandatory prepayments  the facility commitments reduce to billion on march   million on june   and million on december  the revised facility also contains customary operating and financial covenants 
in january we made a mandatory reduction in the facility commitment of million  and in february we made a further million reduction in the facility commitment  which fulfills the march  amortization requirement one month ahead of schedule 
the committed capacity and principal amount outstanding on this facility as of february  were million and million  respectively 
as of february   our credit facilities aggregate committed capacity was billion and our aggregate unused capacity totaled million 
we cannot borrow the unused capacity under these facilities without pledging additional eligible collateral 
we have limited available collateral to pledge to use this unused capacity 
however  such unused capacity may become available to us to the extent we have additional eligible collateral in the future 
as a member of the fhlb san francisco  capitalsource bank has financing availability with the fhlb equal to of capitalsource bank s total assets 
as of december   the maximum financing under this formula was million 
although no advances were outstanding as of december   a letter of credit in the amount of million is outstanding under the facility which reduces our availability 
the financing is subject to various terms and conditions including pledging acceptable collateral  satisfaction of the fhlb stock ownership requirement and certain limits regarding the maximum term of debt

in addition  under our term debt securitizations  the priority of payments are altered if the notes remain outstanding beyond the stated maturity dates and upon other termination events  in which case we would receive no cash flow from these transactions until the notes senior to our retained interests are retired 
a default under our recourse indebtedness could trigger cross default provisions in our other debt facilities  and a default under some of our non recourse indebtedness would trigger cross default provisions in other of our non recourse debt 
in february  we obtained a waiver of the consolidated ebitda to interest expense financial covenant for our syndicated bank credit facility for the reporting period ending december  the waiver was obtained to provide certainty that the net loss reported for the quarter ended and the year ended december   after making certain adjustments as provided for in the covenant definition  would not cause an event of default under the facility agreement 
because this covenant was tested on a rolling month basis  we would likely have breached it for the quarter ending march  and other periods in however  on february   we amended this facility to modify the consolidated ebitda to interest expense financial covenant to exclude the period ending december   and to define and measure the covenant differently for future periods  including to replace the trailing month measurement period with a quarterly measurement  change the way we measure consolidated ebitda by including up to million of provision for loan losses for the reporting period ending march   and up to million for each reporting period thereafter  and set the minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense to for the periods ending march  june  and september   and for each period thereafter  provide that we only count loans that are delinquent by at least days  subject to an insolvency event or are charged off pursuant to our credit and collection policy when calculating our maximum average portfolio charged off ratio  and increase the maximum average portfolio charged off ratios  as follows for the fiscal quarter ended march   i from to  calculated excluding capitalsource bank  and ii from to  calculated including capitalsource bank  and for every fiscal quarter thereafter  i from to  when calculated by excluding capitalsource bank  and ii from to  calculated including capitalsource bank 
during the first quarter of  we obtained waivers of financial covenants to cure or avoid potential events of default and executed amendments with respect to some of our other credit facilities 
for further information on these waivers and amendments  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we may need to obtain other waivers and amendments in the future  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain them on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  upon the occurrence of specified servicer defaults  our lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of our asset backed notes issued in our term debt may elect to terminate us as servicer of the loans under the applicable facility or term debt and appoint a successor servicer or replace us as cash manager for our secured facilities and term debt 
if we were terminated as servicer  we would no longer receive our servicing fee 
in addition  because there can be no assurance that any successor servicer would be able to service the loans according to our standards  the performance of our loans could be materially adversely affected and our income generated from those loans significantly reduced 
equity we offer a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the drip to current and prospective shareholders 
participation in the drip allows common shareholders to reinvest cash dividends and to purchase additional shares of our common stock  in some cases at a discount from the market price 
during the year ended december   we received million related to the direct purchase of million shares of our common stock pursuant to the drip 
we have not sold any shares under the direct purchase features of the drip after may during the year ended december   we received million related to the direct purchase of million shares of our common stock pursuant to the drip 
in addition  we received proceeds of million related to cash dividends reinvested in million shares of our common stock during the year ended december  we received proceeds of million related to the cash dividends reinvested for million shares of our common stock during the year ended december  in june  we sold million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share  including the million shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their over allotment option 
in connection with this offering  we received net proceeds of million  which were used to repay borrowings under our secured credit facilities 
in october and february  we issued  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  in exchange for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding and senior and senior subordinated convertible debentures due and approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated convertible notes due march  respectively 
we retired the debentures acquired in these exchanges 
special purpose entities we use spes as an integral part of our funding activities 
we commonly service loans that we have transferred to these vehicles 
the use of these special purpose entities is generally required in connection with our non recourse secured debt financings in order to legally isolate from us loans that we transfer to these vehicles if we were to be in bankruptcy 
we also used special purpose entities to facilitate the issuance of collateralized loan obligation transactions that are further described below in commitments  guarantees contingencies 
additionally  we have purchased beneficial ownership interests in residential mortgage assets that are held by special purpose entities established by third parties 
we evaluate all spes with which we are affiliated to determine whether such entities must be consolidated for financial statement purposes 
if we determine that such entities represent variable interest entities as defined by fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 fin r  we consolidate these entities if we also determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
for special purpose entities for which we determine we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for our economic interests in these entities in accordance with the nature of our investments 
as further discussed in note  mortgage related receivables and related owner trust securitizations  in february  we acquired beneficial interests in two special purpose entities that acquired and securitized pools of residential mortgage loans 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r  we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these spes and  therefore  consolidated the assets and liabilities of such entities for financial statement purposes 
additionally  and as further discussed in note  borrowings  the assets and related liabilities of all special purpose entities that we use to issue our term debt are recognized on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets as of december  and commitments  guarantees contingencies as of december  and  we had unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients of billion and billion  respectively 
due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
we expect that these unfunded commitments will continue to indefinitely exceed our parent company s available funds 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace 
in many cases  our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements  our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing  including compliance with all provisions of the loan agreements  and or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements 
in many other cases  however  there are no such prerequisites to future fundings by us and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time 
to the extent there are unfunded commitments with respect to a loan that is owned partially by capitalsource bank and the parent company  unless our client is in default  capitalsource bank is obligated in some cases pursuant to intercompany agreements to fund its portion of the unfunded commitment before the parent company is required to fund its portion 
in addition  in some cases we may be able to borrow additional amounts under our secured credit facilities as we fund these unfunded commitments 
we have non cancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment 
the leases expire over the next years and contain provisions for certain annual rental escalations 
a discussion of these contingencies is included in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we are obligated to provide standby letters of credit in conjunction with several of our lending arrangements 
as of december  and  we had issued million and million  respectively  in letters of credit which expire at various dates over the next six years 
if a borrower defaults on its commitment s subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements  we would be responsible to meet the borrower s financial obligation and would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower 
a discussion of these contingencies is included in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   we had identified conditional asset retirement obligations primarily related to the future removal and disposal of asbestos that is contained within certain of our direct real estate investment properties 
for reasons further discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   no liability for conditional asset retirement obligations was recorded on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  we had provided a financial guarantee to a third party warehouse lender that financed the purchase of approximately million of commercial loans by a special purpose entity to which one of our other wholly owned indirect subsidiaries provided advisory services in connection with such purchases of commercial loans 
we had provided the warehouse lender with a limited guarantee under which we agreed to assume a portion of net losses realized in connection with those loans held by the special purpose entity up to a specific loss limit 
in may  we paid the third party warehouse lender million in full settlement of this guarantee in connection with our consolidation of the special purpose entity 
in connection with certain securitization transactions and secured financings  we typically make customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying transferred assets and collateral 
prior to any securitization transaction and secured financing  we generally perform due diligence with respect to the assets to be included in the securitization transaction and the collateral to ensure that they satisfy the representations and warranties 
in our capacity as originator and servicer in certain securitization transactions and secured financings  we may be required to repurchase or substitute loans which breach a representation and warranty as of their date of transfer to the securitization or financing vehicle 
from time to time we are party to legal proceedings 
we do not believe that any currently pending or threatened proceeding  if determined adversely to us  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  including our cash flows 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases and we have committed to contribute up to an additional million to private equity funds  and million to an equity investment 
the contractual obligations under our debt are included in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  the expected contractual obligations under our certificates of deposit  debt  operating leases and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december   were as follows certificates of repurchase credit term convertible subordinated mortgage notes deposit agreements facilities debt debt debt debt payable other total in thousands thereafter total the contractual obligations for credit facilities are computed based on the stated maturities of the facilities including amortization periods but not considering optional annual renewals and assume utilization of available term out features 
excludes net unamortized discounts of million and is based on contractual amortization schedule of our loans 
the underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which could shorten the life of the term debt transactions  conversely  the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which may lengthen the life of the term debt transactions 
at our option  we may substitute loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt transactions 
in addition  the contractual obligations for our term debt transactions are computed based on the estimated life of the instrument 
the contractual obligations for the owner trust term debt are computed based on the estimated lives of the underlying adjustable rate prime residential mortgage whole loans 
the contractual obligations for convertible debt are computed based on the initial put call date 
the legal maturities of the convertible debt are and for further discussion of terms of our convertible debt and factors impacting their maturity see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the contractual obligations for subordinated debt are computed based on the legal maturities  which are between and includes operating leases and non cancelable contracts 
we enter into derivative contracts under which we either receive cash or are required to pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december   with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts changes daily as market interest rates change 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a client s or counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
credit risk exists primarily in our lending  leasing and derivative portfolios 
the degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the size of the asset or transaction  the credit characteristics of the client  the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral 
we manage credit risk of our derivatives and credit related arrangements by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding with an individual counterparty  by obtaining collateral based on management s assessment of the client  by applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk 
as appropriate  the capitalsource inc and capitalsource bank credit committees evaluate and approve credit standards and oversee the credit risk management function related to our commercial loans  direct real estate investments and other investments 
their primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring conditions in real estate and other markets having an impact on lending activities  and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk and by monitoring our client s financial condition and performance 
commercial banking segment credit risk management for the commercial loan portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of a client based on an analysis of the client s financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a client  each commercial credit exposure or transaction is assigned a risk rating that is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
while rating criteria vary by product  each loan rating focuses on the same three factors credit  collateral  and financial performance 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the client s or counterparty s financial condition  cash flow or financial situation 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
in making decisions regarding credit  we consider risk rating  collateral  industry and single name concentration limits 
we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a client s or counterparty s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we syndicate loan exposure to other lenders  sell loans and use other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of our loan portfolio 
residential mortgage investment segment a significant asset class in our residential mortgage investment portfolio was agency rmbs 
for all agency rmbs we benefited from a full guarantee from fannie mae or freddie mac  and looked to this guarantee to mitigate the risk of changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loans underlying the agency rmbs 
however  variation in the level of credit losses could impact the duration of our investments since a credit loss results in the prepayment of the relevant loan by the guarantor 
another significant asset class in our residential mortgage investment portfolio is mortgage related receivables 
with respect to mortgage related receivables  we are directly exposed to the level of credit losses on the underlying mortgage loans 
with respect to non agency rmbs we are exposed to changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loan underlying these assets and the value or performance of our investment was impacted by higher levels of credit losses 
concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in commercial lending and leasing activities with clients primarily throughout the united states 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration was healthcare and social assistance  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration was new york  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was skilled nursing  which made up approximately of the investments 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was florida  which made up approximately of the investments 
derivative counterparty credit risk derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements 
this risk consists primarily of the termination value of agreements where we are in a favorable position 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered and provided for separately from the allowance for loan losses 
we manage the credit risk associated with various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review and monitoring procedures 
we obtain collateral from all counterparties based on terms stipulated in the collateral support annex 
we also monitor all exposure and collateral requirements daily on a per counterparty basis 
we continually monitor the fair value of collateral received from counterparties and may request additional collateral from counterparties or return collateral pledged as deemed appropriate 
our agreements generally include master netting agreements whereby the counterparties are entitled to settle their derivative positions net 
as of december  and  the gross positive fair value of our derivative financial instruments were million and million  respectively 
our master netting agreements reduced the exposure to this gross positive fair value by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we held million of collateral against derivative financial instruments as of december  we held no such amount as of december  accordingly  our net exposure to derivative counterparty credit risks as of december  and  was million and million  respectively 
market risk management market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements 
this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities including loans  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans associated with our traditional lending activities and market risk mitigation activities 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations  primarily including our loans  residential mortgage investments and borrowings 
our traditional loan products are non trading positions and are reported at amortized cost 
additionally  debt obligations that we incur to fund our business operations are recorded at historical cost 
while gaap requires a historical cost view of such assets and liabilities  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk is the effect of changes in the economic value of our loans  and our other interest rate sensitive instruments and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of various types of derivative instruments 
for a detailed discussion of our derivatives  see note  derivative instruments  of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  interest rate risk management commercial banking segment healthcare net lease segment interest rate risk in our commercial banking and healthcare net lease segments refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates  primarily various short term interest rates  including libor based rates and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our lending and borrowing on a variable rate basis 
the majority of our commercial loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the libor rate or a prime based rate with almost all of our other loans bearing interest at a fixed rate 
the majority of our borrowings bear interest at a spread to libor or cp  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates in certain of our fixed rate loans and investments 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes in these assets by engaging in hedging activities as discussed below 
the estimated decreases increases in net interest income for a month segment based on changes in the interest rates applied to the combined portfolios of our commercial banking segment and healthcare net lease segment as of december   were as follows in thousands rate change basis points for the purposes of the above analysis  we included related derivatives  excluded principal payments and assumed a advance rate on our variable rate borrowings 
approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our commercial loans had interest rate floors as of december  of the loans with interest rate floors  approximately had contractual rates below the interest rate floor and the floor was providing a benefit to us 
the loans with interest rate floors as of december   were as follows amount percentage of outstanding total portfolio in thousands loans with contractual interest rates exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor below the interest rate floor loans with no interest rate floor total includes related interest receivable 
we use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain fixed rate assets 
we also enter into additional basis swap agreements to hedge basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate and prime rate loans to one month libor 
additionally  we use offsetting interest rate caps to hedge loans with embedded interest rate caps 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the one month libor based term debt 
we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain fixed rate debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate debt to one month libor 
we have also entered into relatively short dated forward exchange agreements to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency denominated loans 
fair value measurements a portion of our financial instruments are accounted for at fair value both on a recurring and nonrecurring basis 
specifically  investments in debt securities that are classified as trading and derivative instruments are periodically adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis through earnings 
investments in debt and equity securities that are classified as available for sale are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis through accumulated other comprehensive income  to the extent the losses are not considered other than temporary 
in addition  we may be required from time to time to measure certain of our assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value 
we use the fair value of collateral method to assess fair value for certain of our commercial loans held for investment for purposes of establishing a specific reserve against those assets 
the fair value of equity investments is estimated for purposes of assessing and measuring such assets for impairment purposes 
as discussed in critical accounting estimates below  we follow the guidance in sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
in determining the fair value of our financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis 
accordingly  we classify each of these financial instruments within level  level or level of the fair value hierarchy of sfas no 
as of december   of total assets and of total liabilities consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
of these financial assets carried at fair value  billion of total assets were classified as level while million of total assets were classified as level as of december  from a liability perspective  million of total liabilities were classified as level while no liabilities were classified as level as of december  as of december   we had no financial assets or liabilities classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values of level or level financial instruments financial instruments that are actively traded in the marketplace or that have values based on readily available market value data require little  if any  subjectivity to be applied when determining the instrument s fair value 
these investments are classified as either level or level within the sfas no 
hierarchy 
whether a financial instrument is classified as level or level depends largely on its similarity with other financial instruments in the marketplace and our ability to obtain corroborative data regarding whether the market in which the financial instrument trades is active 
our largest portfolio of financial instruments carried at level is our agency rmbs portfolio 
other level financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include our marketable securities  equity securities in public companies and our over the counter traded derivatives 
in addition  our loans held for sale are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are classified as level when fair values are determined through actual market transactions 
below is a discussion of the valuation methods and assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our significant financial assets and liabilities classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
marketable securities marketable securities consist of agency discount notes  agency callable notes  agency debt  agency mbs and corporate debt that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as available for sale securities 
the securities are valued using quoted prices from external market participants  including pricing services 
if quoted prices are not available  the fair value is determined using the quoted market prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent pricing models  which utilize observable market data such as benchmark yields  reported trades and issuer spreads 
the prices we receive from external market participants are not adjusted as we believe that these prices represent the best estimate of fair value 
fair values obtained from pricing services are validated on a monthly basis by comparing them to fair values obtained from the independent asset custodian 
residential mortgage backed securities our agency rmbs include mortgage backed securities issued and guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
these securities are carried at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as trading securities 
the securities are valued using quoted prices from external market participants  including pricing services 
the prices we receive from external market participants are not adjusted as we believe that these prices represent the best estimate of fair value 
we validate pricing information received from external market participants by obtaining independent  non binding broker quotes from third parties  comparing the implied option adjusted spread oas to the oas for closely comparable securities with an available market price and reviewing actual sale activity occurring subsequent to the pricing date 
during the first quarter of  we sold our remaining agency rmbs with a fair value of billion for a gain of million 
derivative assets and liabilities derivatives are carried at fair value on a recurring basis and primarily relate to interest rate swaps  caps  floors  basis swaps and forward exchange contracts which we enter into to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk 
our derivatives are principally traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available 
instead  derivatives are measured using market observable inputs such as interest rate yield curves  volatilities and basis spreads 
we also consider counterparty credit risk in valuing our derivatives 
as discussed in more detail in credit risk management above  we manage counterparty credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties and monitoring exposure and collateral requirements on a daily basis 
we do not believe counterparty credit risk is a significant risk with our derivatives as a result of the collateral requirements in place in these contracts 
fair values of level financial instruments when observable market prices and data do not exist  significant management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in those cases  small changes in assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation 
due to the unavailability of observable inputs for our level assets  management assumptions used in the valuation models play a significant role in these fair value estimates 
in times of severe market volatility and illiquidity  there may be more uncertainty and variability with lack of market data to use in the valuation process 
an illiquid market is one in which little or no observable activity has occurred or one that lacks willing buyers 
to factor in market illiquidity  management makes adjustments to certain inputs in the valuation models and makes other assumptions to ensure fair values are reasonable and reflect current market conditions 
our financial assets carried at fair value on a recurring basis that are classified as level within the sfas no 
hierarchy include our non agency rmbs  debt securities classified as available for sale and warrants 
other level assets with fair value adjustments recorded on a nonrecurring basis include loans held for investment  equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity methods of accounting and loans held for sale when the fair values are determined through internally developed valuation models 
below is a discussion of the valuation methods and assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our significant financial assets and liabilities classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
loans held for investment fair value adjustments are recorded on our loans held for investment on a nonrecurring basis when we have determined that it is necessary to record a specific reserve against the loans 
we may utilize the fair value of collateral  less costs to sell  to measure the specific reserve for those loans that are collateral dependent 
to determine the fair value of the collateral  we may employ different approaches depending on the type of collateral 
typically  we determine the fair value of the collateral using internally developed models  which require significant management judgment 
the primary inputs of the valuation models vary based on the nature of the collateral and may include expected cash flows  recovery rates  performance multiples and risk premiums based on changing market conditions 
our models utilize industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
valuations consider comparable market transactions where available 
in certain cases where our collateral is a fixed or other tangible asset  we will periodically obtain a third party appraisal to corroborate management s estimates of fair value 
when deemed necessary  we apply an additional liquidity discount to the valuation model to reflect current market conditions 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million related to our loans held for investment measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these losses were attributable to an increased number of loans requiring a specific reserve during the year  as well as declines in the fair value of collateral for these loans 
available for sale investments investments carried at fair value on a recurring basis include debt securities classified as available for sale under sfas no 
debt securities are primarily corporate bonds whose values are determined using discounted cash flow techniques for which key inputs include the timing and amount of future cash flows and market yields 
market yields are based on comparisons to other instruments for which market data is available 
significant unobservable inputs include estimates of credit default  recovery and prepayment rates as well as assumptions surrounding the comparability to other investments for which observable price and spread data is available 
valuations may also be adjusted to reflect the illiquidity of the investment 
such adjustments are based on market available evidence and management s best estimates 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we utilized pricing services to value our debt security investments 
we considered the inputs provided by pricing services in arriving at our fair value estimates as of december  however  given the declining volume of trading activity surrounding our investments  we concluded that such inputs were no longer representative of the investments fair value 
the prices provided by the pricing services lacked transparency as to the volume and nature of actual transactions  if any  from which these prices were developed 
we believe our methods provide the most reasonable estimates of fair value as they maximize the use of market observable inputs and are most consistent with the approach that would likely be used by market participants in executing actual transactions 
had we based our fair value estimates solely on the inputs provided by pricing services  the fair value of our available for sale securities would have been reduced by million as compared to the fair value estimates reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale 
we evaluate these investments for impairment by considering  among other factors  the length of time and extent to which the market value has been below its cost basis 
during  as a result of the current economic environment  the large majority of our unrealized losses on these debt securities were recognized in earnings as other than temporary impairment 
for investments that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired as of december   at least a portion of the impairment recognized was attributable to deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer 
however  at this time  we do not anticipate liquidating these investments in the short term and believe that amounts realized upon settlement or maturity of the investments may be greater than the fair values recorded as of december  equity investments investments accounted for under the cost or equity methods of accounting are carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to the extent that they are impaired during the period 
we impair these investments to fair value when we have determined that other than temporary impairment exists 
as there is rarely an observable price or market for such investments  we determine fair value using internally developed models 
our models utilize industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of ebitda  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
we reduce this value by the value of debt outstanding to arrive at an estimated equity value of the enterprise 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
the primary inputs utilized in our valuation models include borrower financial information  transaction multiples and liquidity discounts 
transaction multiples are based on observable market transactions  when available  or similar transactions for comparable companies 
in determining the appropriate multiple to use  we typically review a range of comparable multiples and consider the amount of time elapsed since the transaction occurred  the similarity of the investment transacted to our investment and the similarity of comparable public companies to our investment 
in cases where no comparable transactions are available  we use a comparable multiple within the respective company s industry classification determined by standard poor s 
when deemed necessary  we apply an additional liquidity discount to the valuation model 
in certain cases  liquidity discounts are already embedded into the transaction multiple so no additional discount is applied 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million and million related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of our equity investments accounted for under the cost and equity method of accounting  respectively 
we evaluate these investments for impairment by considering  among other factors  the length of time and extent to which the market value has been below its cost basis 
during  as a result of the current economic environment  the majority of our unrealized losses on these investments were recognized in earnings as other than temporary impairment 
critical accounting estimates accounting policies are integral to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions based on information that is available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of such statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and our critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period  or if changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure related to these estimates 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management performs detailed reviews of this portfolio quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting loan losses 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowance 
the commercial loan portfolio comprises large balance  non homogeneous exposures 
these loans are evaluated individually  and are risk rated based upon borrower  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant to determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
when necessary  management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans determined to be individually impaired 
an allowance for loan losses is estimated by management based upon the borrower s overall financial condition  financial resources and  when applicable  the estimated realizable value of any collateral 
loans subject to individual reviews are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
these risk classifications  in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience  current economic conditions  industry performance trends  and any other pertinent information  including individual valuations on nonperforming loans are considered in the estimation of the allowance for loan losses 
the historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment 
in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans  we maintain allowances that are based on an evaluation for impairment of certain commercial and residential portfolios 
these allowances are based on historical experience  current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments 
certain considerations are made in relation to the length and severity of outstanding balances 
we generally do not factor in guarantees from our capital call agreements with our borrowers private equity sponsors in determining the overall allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  when performing the analysis on an individual troubled loan  we do not consider any applicable borrower guarantees when calculating our potential for a specific loss 
the process for determining the reserve factors and the related level of loan loss reserves is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions that require judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and  therefore  net income 
in this case  management is required to make judgments related  but not limited  to i risk ratings for pools of commercial loans  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loss rates used for commercial loans  iv adjustments made to assess current events and conditions  v considerations regarding economic uncertainty  and vi overall credit and economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and to corresponding reserve factors that we use to estimate the allowance and that are reflective of historical losses 
we have assigned reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation were determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  whether the loan is underwritten based on the borrower s assets  real estate or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal credit rating assigned to the loans 
we update these reserve factors periodically to capture actual and recent behavioral characteristics of the portfolios  such as latest credit agency rating information  actual and expected trends in underlying economic or market conditions and changes in our loss mitigation strategies 
we estimate the allowance by applying historical loss factors derived from loss tracking mechanisms associated with actual portfolio movements over a specified period of time  using a standard loan grading procedure 
these estimates are adjusted when necessary based on additional analysis of long term average loss experience  external loan loss data and other risks identified from current and expected credit market conditions and trends  including management s judgment for estimate inaccuracy and uncertainty 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of basis points applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december   was as follows estimated increase change in reserve factors decrease in the basis points allowance for loan losses in thousands these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration  or improvement  in risk ratings  but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the reserve factors currently in use are appropriate 
the process of determining the level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
if our internal credit ratings  reserve factors or specific reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan losses 
we also consider whether losses may have been incurred in connection with unfunded commitments to lend although  in making this assessment  we exclude from consideration those commitments for which funding is subject to our approval based on the adequacy of underlying collateral that is required to be presented by a borrower or other terms and conditions for detailed analysis on the historical loan loss experience and the roll forwards of the allowance for loan losses for the last five fiscal years  see table  summary of loan loss experience  on page of this form k 
fair value of financial instruments we adopted sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy prioritizes observable data from active markets  placing measurements using those inputs in level of the fair value hierarchy  and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs and classifies these as level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas no 
are described below level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or models for which all significant inputs are observable in the market either directly or indirectly  level valuations based on models that use inputs that are unobservable in the market and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measurement 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  management s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable market based inputs  when appropriate  to value our financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis or to determine whether an adjustment to fair value is needed for assets carried at fair value on a non recurring basis 
given the nature of some of our financial instruments carried at fair value  whether on a recurring or nonrecurring basis  clearly determinable market based valuation inputs are often not available 
therefore  these instruments are valued using internal assumptions and classified as level within the sfas no 
hierarchy 
the estimates of fair values reflect our best judgments regarding the appropriate valuation methods and assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by a number of factors  such as the type of instrument  the liquidity of the markets for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
judgments in these cases include  but are not limited to selection of third party market data sources  evaluation of the expected reliability of the estimate  reliability  timeliness and cost of alternative valuation methodologies  and selection of proxy instruments  as necessary 
see fair value measurements above for additional discussion surrounding the specific methods and assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis 
income taxes we elected reit status under the code when we filed our federal tax return for the year ended december  we operated as a reit through  but revoked our reit election effective january  while we were a reit  we generally were not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed to our shareholders that were derived from our reit qualifying activities  but were subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings we derived from our trss 
while we were a reit  we were still subject to foreign  state and local taxation in various foreign  state and local jurisdictions  including those in which we transacted business or resided 
in order to estimate our corporate level income taxes while we were a reit  we were required to determine the amount of our net income derived from our trss during the entire taxable year  and if any  expected undistributed reit taxable income 
if our estimates of the source of the net income were not appropriate  income taxes could be materially different from amounts reported in our quarterly and annual consolidated statements of income 
while we were a reit  we continued to be subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings we derived from our trss 
as more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
income tax receivable  reported as a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheet  represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date 
we consider many factors in filing income tax returns  including statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance  in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction 
in applying the principles of sfas  we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities 
these revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes  which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies  can materially affect our operating results for any given reporting period 
effective january   we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from our operations

management report on internal controls over financial reporting the management of capitalsource inc capitalsource is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
capitalsource s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
in july  we acquired approximately billion of deposits  participation in a pool of commercial real estate loans the a participation interest and retail banking branches from fremont investment loan and commenced operations of capitalsource bank

our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
as indicated in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting  management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of capitalsource bank  which is included in the december  consolidated financial statements of capitalsource inc and constituted of consolidated total assets as of december  and of consolidated net investment income for the year then ended
