item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview as a holding company of various product and service entities  we have historically invested in businesses that we believe are undervalued or underperforming  and or in operations that are poised for significant growth 
management s strategic focus is to support the growth of its operations by increasing revenues and revenue streams  managing costs and creating earnings growth 
our operations are largely decentralized from the corporate office 
autonomy is given to subsidiary entities  and there are few integrated business functions ie sales  marketing  purchasing and human resources 
day to day operating decisions are made by subsidiary management teams 
our corporate management team assists in operational decisions when deemed necessary  selects subsidiary management teams and handles capital allocation among our operations 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in  restructured in and redomesticated to the state of indiana in may prior to  we conducted business mainly in the entertainment industry 
until november   we classified our businesses under five operating segments business solutions  wireless infrastructure  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet technologies  and electronics integration 
effective november   we approved the sale of all of our remaining operating subsidiaries within four of our five segments wireless infrastructure  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet infrastructure  and electronics integration 
consequently  as of the effective date of the transaction  our business solutions segment is the company s remaining operating segment 
the sales transaction  combined with other significant events disclosed in note of our financial statements in item  will change the focus of our company in fiscal and thereafter 
this operational change in our company will impact the comparability of our financial information compared to historical data presented in past filings 
key factors affecting or potentially affecting results of operations and financial condition management considers the following factors  events  trends and uncertainties to be important to understanding its results of operations and financial condition holding company over the past five fiscal periods  we have completed six key acquisitions 
four of these key acquisitions have been in the peo industry

our historical growth has been due to several significant acquisitions over the past five fiscal periods 
future growth in revenues and earnings may not increase at the same rate as historical growth 
certain expenses  such as wages  benefits and rent  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self funded medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
a control group  which includes our two majority shareholders  owns of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  these people could have a controlling influence in determining the outcome of any corporate matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations  election of directors and any other significant corporate actions 
the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of the company s other shareholders and their stock ownership may thereby limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the management and affairs of the company 
business solutions our peos provide services typically managed by a company s internal human resources and accounting departments  including payroll and tax processing and management  worker s compensation and risk management  benefits administration  unemployment administration  human resource compliance services  k and retirement plan administration and employee assessments

the peos bill the client their worksite employees gross wages plus an overall service fee that includes components of employment related taxes  employment benefits insurance  and administration of those items 
the component of the service fee related to administration varies  in part  according to the size of the client  the amount and frequency of payroll payments and the method of delivery of such payments

charges by the peos are invoiced along with each periodic payroll delivered to the client
