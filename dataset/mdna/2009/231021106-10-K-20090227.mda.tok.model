organization of information the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements 
our md a is presented in the following sections executive summary and financial highlights results of operations restructuring charges operating segment results liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and other commercial commitments off balance sheet financing application of critical accounting estimates recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
table of contents executive summary and financial highlights we are a leading global power provider that designs  manufactures  distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines  electric power generation systems and engine related component products  including filtration and exhaust aftertreatment  fuel systems  controls and air handling systems 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
we have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve  including paccar inc  international truck and engine corporation navistar international corporation  chrysler llc  volvo ab  daimler trucks north america formerly freightliner  ford motor company  case new holland  komatsu  and volkswagen 
we serve our customers through a network of more than company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  power generation  components and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves 
this type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
the engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and recreational vehicles  as well as various industrial applications including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail and military 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines  generator sets and alternators 
the components segment includes sales of filtration products  exhaust aftertreatment systems  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets  and service parts  as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on varying conditions in the markets we serve  particularly the on highway  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit 
our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages 
economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products 
as a worldwide business  our operations are also affected by political  economic and regulatory matters  including environmental and emissions standards  in the countries we serve 
however  our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact of any one industry or customer and the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 
in  softness in the pick up truck  recreational vehicle  and recreational marine markets worsened and evidence of a downturn in the united states us and european economies and softening in global markets became more evident  particularly in the fourth quarter when we saw severe declines in the truck and construction businesses 
despite these unfavorable conditions  we reported increased net sales and net income during compared to approximately percent of our annual sales came from countries other than the us and that trend grew to percent for the year ended december   which helped to mitigate some of our exposure in the us economy 
the diversity of our business portfolio has contributed to the significant organic growth we have experienced over the past several years and continued into despite more difficult economic conditions 
we continued our strong performance of the past four years into with a fifth straight year of record net sales and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted share  on sales of billion  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  on sales of billion 
the income improvement was driven by a percent increase in net sales and a percent increase in gross margin  as we benefited from improved pricing and higher demand across most of our businesses  increased market share in a number of markets and focused cost reduction 
table of contents efforts 
however  as the result of the deepening global credit crisis that began impacting many of our markets in the fourth quarter of and the bleak global economic outlook for  we implemented targeted restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of at a pretax cost of million million after tax  or per share 
we are also taking additional restructuring actions in early to adjust for continued weakening markets and decaying economic conditions affecting most of our markets

table of contents vs 
net sales net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers 
our commercial power generation business experienced increased demand  especially internationally 
we increased our market share in north american includes the united states us and canada and excludes mexico heavy duty truck and medium duty truck and bus markets 
industrial engine markets demand increased  particularly the international construction and commercial marine markets 
our distribution segment benefited from increased demand as well as the acquisition of a majority interest in three previously independent distributors 
our turbocharger and emissions solutions businesses experienced increased demand 
we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation 
these increases in net sales were partially offset by softening in the us economy which has resulted in a significant reduction in demand in light duty automotive and recreational markets for engines as well as decreased demand for consumer power generation products and a significant reduction in most other markets in the fourth quarter of as the result of the economic recession 
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the operating segments results section 
gross margin significant drivers of the change in gross margins were as follows vs 
increase decrease in millions price volume mix production costs currency warranty expense material costs other total gross margin increased by million  and as a percentage of sales increased by percentage points 
benefits from increased pricing and a more favorable volume mix of products sold were partially offset by higher material costs reflecting the increase in commodity prices during the year and higher warranty expense 
our warranty expense reflects favorable warranty experience for some engine products and our provision related to sales in was percent of sales  down from percent in this result was more than offset by negative trends primarily in certain mid range engine products launched in for which we recorded additional warranty liability of approximately million in the fourth quarter of a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segments results section 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased consulting expenses of million  increased compensation and related expenses of approximately million  and the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent north american distributors 
increased headcount and compensation and related expenses included salaries  variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth 
overall selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent in from percent in research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses increased significantly  primarily due to higher spending on development programs for future products including increased headcount  compensation and related expenses 
compensation and related expenses include salaries  variable compensation and fringe benefits 
fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate 
overall  research  development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent in from percent in equity  royalty and interest income from investees equity  royalty and interest income from investees increased significantly  primarily due to increases in income from north american distributors of million  dongfeng cummins engine company  ltd 
dcec of million  increased royalty and interest income of million and increased income from chongqing cummins engine company limited ccec of million 
shanghai fleetguard filter co  ltd also experienced an increase of million 
these increases were slightly offset by decreases from tata cummins ltd 
tcl of million and cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc mercruiser of million 
north american distributors increased primarily due to income from a joint venture which we formed in the fourth quarter of dcec sales increased largely due to prebuy activity in the first half of prior to a mid year emissions change 
ccec increased primarily due to increased sales volumes 
tcl experienced decreased sales volumes for the year while mercruiser profits declined due to a significant decline in the recreational marine market and increased research  development and engineering expenses 
other operating expense income  net years ended december  in millions other operating expense income royalty income gain on sale of fixed assets flood damage expenses royalty expense amortization of other intangibles other  net total other operating expense income  net the decrease in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the million gain on the sale of universal silencer in 
table of contents the increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to amortization of purchased premiums related to the acquisition of a north american distributor in interest income interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in compared to interest expense interest expense decreased primarily due to declining short term interest rates and a benefit from our interest rate swap 
other expense income  net years ended december  in millions other expense income change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance bank charges foreign currency losses gains other  net total other expense income  net the change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration  especially in the fourth quarter of  which included the write down of certain investments to zero 
the foreign currency exchange losses in were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations in  especially with the british pound  the euro  the australian dollar and the indian rupee 
income tax expense our income tax rates are generally less than the percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits 
our effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for the decrease is primarily due to greater foreign earnings in  which are subject to lower tax rates 
our income tax provision also includes a million percent reduction in the fourth quarter due to the legislative reinstatement of the us research tax credit 
we expect our effective tax rate to be percent excluding any discrete items that may arise 
minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries eliminates the income or loss attributable to non cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities 
minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased primarily due to higher income at our consolidated subsidiary in india 
cummins india limited s cil s  a percent owned subsidiary  minority interest increased million due to the creation of a new export business in and favorable price adjustments for high horsepower products 
there were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant 

table of contents net income and diluted earnings per share net income and diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to higher volumes  improved margins  higher equity income and a lower effective tax rate 
these increases were partially offset by warranty expense  restructuring charges and investment losses primarily occurring during the fourth quarter of  in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects 
outlook near term we expect sales and profits to be lower in given the economic outlook 
our operating results in will depend on how the current global economic conditions impact the markets we serve 
forecasting for is a significant challenge with these uncertain market conditions 
many of the markets we serve are slowing significantly as a result of the credit crisis and softening global economic environment and we expect sales will be down significantly from levels 
in response to anticipated market conditions we executed voluntary and involuntary separation actions in december of and january of we expect to continue to focus on cost reductions and scaling production to meet current demand 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  the overall impact on our customers as well as end user demand for our products could have a significant adverse impact on our near term results 
in light of current economic conditions  if conditions continue to worsen in  it is reasonably possible that we may be required to incur impairment charges on certain assets as we decrease production or close certain manufacturing facilities in response to decreasing demand 
impairments could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
at this time we cannot estimate these potential impairment charges 
long term while there is uncertainty in the near term market as a result of the current economic conditions  we continue to be optimistic that opportunities for long term growth and profitability will continue in the future 
vs 
net sales net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers 
our commercial generator and alternator businesses benefited from improved pricing and strong organic growth 
our emission solutions and turbocharger businesses experienced strong organic growth 
we benefited from improved pricing for emission compliant engines 
most on highway and off highway markets experienced strong demand 
we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation 
these increases were partially offset by demand in our north american heavy duty on highway market decreased as a result of the change in emissions standards 
we deconsolidated one of our north american joint ventures beginning in whose sales totaled million

minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries minority interests are primarily attributable to cil  a percent owned subsidiary and wuxi holset engineering co 
ltd 
wuxi  a percent owned subsidiary 
these two subsidiaries accounted for over percent of the total minority interest in these increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of cummins eastern canada llp cec  a percent owned subsidiary  on january  the remainder of the consolidated partially owned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in income 
net income and diluted earnings per share net income and diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to higher volumes  significant improvement in equity earnings  lower interest expense and favorable foreign currency effects 
these increases were partially offset by higher fixed costs to support growth and a higher effective tax rate 
restructuring charges we have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of these actions were in response to the continued deterioration we saw in our us businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of  as well as a reduction in orders in most us and global markets for we reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately employees  or percent 
we offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the us based on a clearly defined set of criteria 
we also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately hourly employees  the majority of which received severance benefits 
the compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits  including health care  life insurance and outplacement services 
the voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately employees 
the remaining professional reductions of employees were involuntary 
the expenses recorded during the year ended december   included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations 
during  we incurred a pretax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately million 
employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated  benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan 
estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved  actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates 
at december   of the approximately  employees to be affected by this plan   had been terminated 
if the restructuring actions are successfully implemented  we expect such actions to yield approximately million to million in annual savings 
approximately percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales  percent in selling  general and administrative expenses  and percent in research  development and engineering expenses 
we expect all of the pretax charge to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations 

table of contents the table below summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring expenses  which is included in the balance of other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets for the year ended december  total expenses payments accrued balance at december  in millions restructuring charges restructuring charges include severance pay and benefits and related charges 
we do not include restructuring charges in the segment results 
the pretax impact of allocating restructuring charges for the year ended december   would have been as follows in millions engine power generation components distribution corporate total restructuring charges in early  we announced additional reductions in our workforce  through both voluntary and involuntary actions  of approximately  employees by march   including salaried employees and hourly employees 
in light of current economic conditions  if conditions continue to worsen in  it is reasonably possible that we may be required to take further actions  including workforce reductions and impairments on certain assets as we decrease production or close certain manufacturing facilities in response to decreasing demand 
these actions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we expect our first quarter restructuring charge to exceed the amount taken in operating segment results our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  power generation  components  and distribution

heavy duty sales increased primarily due to an increase in our market share in the north american includes the us and canada and excludes mexico heavy duty truck markets  increased mexican heavy duty truck sales in the first six months of resulting from the pre buy activity ahead of mexico s july   new emissions requirements and weaker demand in the first six months of resulting from the pre buy to replace trucks ahead of the emissions regulations change 
industrial market sales increased primarily related to strength in commercial marine and construction markets 
medium duty trucks sales increased due to increased demand in global medium duty truck markets  primarily due to our market share increases in the north american medium duty truck market  weaker demand in the first six months of resulting from the pre buy to replace trucks ahead of the emissions regulations change and strong demand in latin america driven by strong economic conditions in brazil in stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our power generation segment  especially internationally 
medium duty bus sales increased due to market share gains in the north american bus market 
we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation 
these increases were partially offset by a percent decline in units sold to chrysler 
this decline was due to the deteriorating demand for light duty trucks in north america as the result of the softening us economy and concerns over fuel prices earlier in the year 
total on highway related sales were percent of total engine segment sales in  compared to percent in segment ebit engine segment ebit decreased primarily due to lower engine volumes in the mid range on highway truck markets  increased warranty expense and increased material cost partially offset by improved industrial engine and parts pricing and more favorable sales mix in the on highway markets

table of contents liquidity and capital resources management s assessment of liquidity we believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong despite the downturn in the us and global economies 
our strong balance sheet and improved credit ratings enabled us to secure a new three year revolving credit facility in the third quarter of we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity 
as of december   other sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million  billion available under our revolving credit facility  million  based on eligible receivables  available under our accounts receivable sales program and million available under international credit facilities 
the maturity schedule of our existing long term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term 
required annual principal payments range from million to million over each of the next five years 
while the impact of the continued market volatility cannot be predicted  we believe our liquidity will provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital  capital expenditures  projected pension obligations  dividend payments and debt service obligations 
we have considered the impact of recent market instability and credit availability in assessing the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources 
we expect that general market conditions could impact the rate at which we realize our receivables in the future and could impact eligible receivables under our accounts receivable program  however  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in we will continue to diligently monitor our receivables for potential slowing in collections that could occur as a result of softening economic conditions and our customer s access to credit 
the overall decline in market valuations has impacted the current value of our pension trusts as discussed in more detail below 
at this time  we are comfortable that the available credit capacity under our revolving credit facility is available to us 
this assertion is based upon the fact that we drew upon our revolving credit facility with a prompt repayment in february to confirm participation by the banks included in the facility 
as a result  we believe our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions 
a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us more than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at december   are denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences  however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level 
we have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

table of contents working capital summary we fund our working capital with cash from operations and short term borrowings when necessary 
various assets and liabilities  including short term debt  can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs 
as a result  working capital is a prime focus of management attention 
in millions current assets current liabilities working capital current ratio days sales in receivables inventory turnover current assets decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in receivables due to lower sales in the fourth quarter  a million decrease in cash see cash flows below  and a decrease of million in marketable securities due to the decline in the overall market 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  a million increase in inventory and a million increase in deferred income taxes 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the increase in refundable income taxes 
current liabilities decreased million  primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable of million due to reduced purchases in the fourth quarter  a decrease in accrued compensation  benefits and retirement costs of million and a decrease in short term borrowings of million 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in other accrued expenses and an increase in accrued warranty of million 
the increase in other accrued expenses was primarily due to the recognition of liabilities related to commodity and currency hedges  increased deferred revenue and increased workers compensation accruals 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during the year ended december  the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities vs 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december   compared to in both and  our principal source of cash from operations was net income of million and million  respectively  which reflected strong operational performance in both years 
for  the net income contribution was partially offset by a growth in working capital of million and pension contributions of million 
the growth in working capital was 
table of contents largely driven by higher inventories of million and lower accounts payable of million which was partially offset by higher accrued expenses of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in inventory was primarily to support strong business growth while the decrease in accounts payable was more reflective of early shutdowns in many of our manufacturing facilities at the close of  as demand softened throughout the fourth quarter 
the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in warranty expense and the decrease in accounts receivable was driven by the early shutdown and softening demand 
for  working capital increased by million as sales and production growth generated a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable of million 
however  this amount was largely funded by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  also in support of strong volumes 
in addition  pension contributions of million offset strong net income performance 
pensions the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets  market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans 
as the result of the ongoing credit crisis and the related market recession  our pension assets have experienced significant deterioration during through the end of  short term returns for both our us and us pension plans are significantly below our long term expected rate of return of percent and percent  respectively  used in our assumptions due to adverse conditions in the equity markets 
as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets which began at the end of the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter  our pension funds had significant negative returns for  which resulted in a million million after tax charge to shareholders equity in the fourth quarter and thus will create increased pension costs in approximately percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities 
the remaining four percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments  including real estate and private equity 
we made pension contributions of million to our pension plans in we anticipate making contributions of million to million to our pension plans in expected contributions to our defined pension plans in will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 
claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits are expected to approximate million in the million of pension contributions in included voluntary contributions of million 
these contributions and payments include payments from company funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants

table of contents investing activities vs 
net cash used in investing activities increased million for the year ended  compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in capital expenditures  higher investments in businesses of million related to the purchase of three previously independent distributors and the acquisition of consolidated diesel corporation  a manufacturing facility see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  increased cash flows for undesignated hedges of million and higher investments in and advances to equity investees of million 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in the proceeds from the sale of equity investments due to the sale of the european engine alliance in see note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures for the year ended increased percent over to support our growth  and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products 
our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products accelerated across all of our businesses 
we continue to invest approximately percent of our capital in low cost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction and future growth opportunities 
capital expenditures for were million 
in preparation for the challenging economic climate expected in  we have tightened capital expenditures to preserve cash during the recession  and as a result  expect an approximate percent reduction of spending from levels 
this spending excludes any assets that may need to be purchased as a result of the flood 
we anticipate remaining flood related expenditures will range from million to million and will occur over the next four quarters

net cash used in investing activities increased million in  compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in capital expenditures  a million outflow for the purchase of long term investments  an increase of million in cash used for investments in and advances to equity investees and an increased outflow of million for the acquisition of businesses  the majority of which was to acquire the remaining percent equity ownership in a joint venture 

table of contents capital expenditures for the year ended increased percent over to support our growth  and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products 
financing activities vs 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million in  compared to the majority of the decrease in cash outflows was due to the decrease in repurchase of common stock of million  the increase in proceeds from borrowings of million  the million increase in proceeds from sale of stock held by employee benefit trust and a million increase in net borrowings under short term credit arrangements 
these fluctuations were partially offset by the increase in dividend payments of million 
our total debt was million as of december   compared with million at december  total debt as a percent of our total capital  including total long term debt  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  the debt to capital ratio was negatively impacted by a million million after tax charge to shareholders equity to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans

net cash used in financing activities increased million in  compared to the majority of the increase in cash outflows is due to the increase in repurchases of common stock of million and a decrease in the proceeds from borrowings of million  which was partially offset by a million decrease in payments on borrowings and capital leases 
revolving credit agreement on june   we entered into a three year revolving credit agreement  dated as of june  the credit agreement  with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein 
the credit agreement provides a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of cummins 
the credit facility matures on june  the credit facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pro rata with all other unsecured  unsubordinated indebtedness of cummins 
a portion of the credit facility  up to million  is available for swingline loans denominated in us dollars 
loans will bear interest at i a base rate or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of cummins outstanding senior unsecured long term debt 
based on our current long term debt ratings  the applicable margin on libor loans was percent per annum as of december  loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty  subject to customary breakage costs 
the credit facility replaces million in aggregate principal amount of a revolving credit facility former credit agreement maintained by cummins which was terminated effective june  the credit agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the former credit agreement  including  among others  a a leverage ratio  b fixed charge coverage ratio  c limitations on priority indebtedness  d limitations on our ability to consummate a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and e limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business 
the obligation of cummins to pay amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the credit agreement 
such 
table of contents events of default include  among others  a cummins failure to pay the principal of  or interest on  borrowings under the credit facility  b any representation or warranty of cummins in the credit agreement proving to be materially false or misleading  c cummins breach of any of its covenants contained in the credit agreement and d the bankruptcy or insolvency of cummins 
there are no material relationships between cummins or its affiliates and any of the lenders  other than as described above 
repurchase of common stock we announced in february that we have temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash 
in december  the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to million of cummins common stock 
we began making purchases under the plan in march and purchased million of stock during at an average cost of per share 
in july  the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares of cummins common stock

application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
there were no accounting policies adopted during that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect 
table of contents the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs  accounting for income taxes  pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for warranty programs  primarily base warranty and other than product recalls  at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the time of failure 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year  a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
accounting for income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets include million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event our operating performance deteriorates  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we 
table of contents have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries 
in the uk and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
the statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
we adopted sfas  except for the measurement date change  as required on december  we adopted the measurement date change as of january  the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets 
the long term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a year average market value of return 
the long term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities  fixed income  real estate and other miscellaneous investments 
the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period and our expected rate for long term expected return assumptions us plans non us plans a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and  under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo  
table of contents amortized over future years of service 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net pension actuarial losses of million and million for the us and non us pension plans  respectively 
under sfas  the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as these amounts exceed percent of our pbo  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 
the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period and our expected expense for pension expense in millions the decrease in periodic pension expense in was due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 
discount rates us plans non us plans changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in eitf d which suggests the use of a high quality corporate bond rate 
we used bond information provided by standard poors for the us and iboxx for the uk all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the uk and uk were high quality  non callable bonds aa or better as of december  however  for the uk  we removed the bonds from the index that were downgraded during december  but had not yet been removed from the iboxx aa index at the measurement date 
the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to sfas and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in addition  for the us plans  the cash flows were matched to the citigroup pension discount curve as of december  the results of that exercise provided a percent rate which confirmed our selection 
our model called for years of benefit payments 
for the us plans  the sum of the cash flows from the bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process 
the number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio 
the discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 
in developing the uk discount rate  excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years  thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed 
as a result  the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining 
we made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 

table of contents the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 
impact on pension expense increase decrease in millions discount rate used to value liabilities percent increase percent decrease expected rate of return on assets percent increase percent decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense 
a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
our investment policies in the us and us provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long term strategic asset allocation 
we are committed to its long term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection 
rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur 
the rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns 
based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
except for the short term adverse conditions in the equity markets in  our recent three year average rates of return have exceeded percent 
as a result  based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent per year for us pension assets is reasonable 
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
our pension plan asset allocation at december  and and target allocation for are as follows percentage of plan assets at december  target allocation investment description equity securities fixed income real estate other total actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the pension protection act of the act 
the act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes 
among its many provisions  the act establishes a percent funding target for plan years beginning after december   which has now been extended by the us congress due to the recession 
our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional 
table of contents contributions we determine are appropriate 
the table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period and our expected range of contributions for contributions in millions contributions beyond will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the act 
our qualified pension plans in the us and outside the us were under funded at december   by a total of million due to pension trust asset performance 
under sfas  the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs credits are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
increases in actuarial losses reduced our shareholders equity by million after tax in the increases resulted from plan asset performance in note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses  working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi year period 
additionally  management must estimate its weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate 
the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and  if less than the carrying value  a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
as of the end of the third quarter in  we performed the annual impairment assessment required by sfas and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million 
changes in our projections or estimates  a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity forward contracts  currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
as stated in our policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculation purposes 
when material  we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter party or our credit risk 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 

table of contents further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates as a result of our international business presence  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions  we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions 
the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on income by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on income and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 
to achieve this objective  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our million  due in  debt from a fixed rate of to a floating rate based on a libor spread 
the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt  with interest paid semi annually 
this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
commodity prices we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities  we periodically enter into commodity forward contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity forward contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the forward contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by 
table of contents an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note to the consolidated financial statements
