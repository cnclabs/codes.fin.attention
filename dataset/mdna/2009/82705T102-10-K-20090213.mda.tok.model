critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy complies with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and rights of return  is generally recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the buyer which typically occurs upon shipment 
reserves for sales returns are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment 
all shipping costs are charged to cost of product revenue 
for products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns  we recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer 
our estimate of such distributor sell through is based on point of sales reports received from our distributors 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed 
pursuant to our distributor agreements  older or end of life products are sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
for these products  revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue for includes approximately million of product revenue and cost of revenue includes approximately million related to distributor sales for the month of december historically  the company had deferred the recognition of sell through revenue from distributor sales for the third month of a quarter until the following quarter due to the unavailability of reliable sell through information in a timely manner 
as a result of improved business processes  the company was able to eliminate this delay beginning with the fourth quarter of  resulting in fiscal year revenue including an additional month of product revenue from distributor sales in december this one time effect of the inclusion of an additional month of revenue for fiscal year is an increase to net income by approximately million and an increase to net income per share  basic and diluted  by approximately 

table of contents at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred margin on sale to distributors  a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred margin on the sale to distributor effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor 
however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred margin on sale to distributor as a result of negotiated price concessions 
we sell each item in our product price book to all of our distributors worldwide at a relatively uniform list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points based on customer  product  quantity  geography  competitive pricing and other factors 
the majority of our distributors resale are priced at a discount from list price 
often  under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed 
thus  a portion of the deferred margin on the sale to distributor balance represents a portion of distributors original purchase price that will be remitted back to the distributor in the future 
the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred margin on the sale to distributors line item that will be remitted back to the distributors 
we reduce deferred margin by anticipated or determinable future price concessions 
we derive revenue from license of our internally developed intellectual property ip 
we enter into ip licensing agreements that generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our ip components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee 
revenue earned under contracts with our licensees is classified as licensing revenue 
our license fee arrangements generally include multiple deliverables and for multiple deliverable arrangements we follow the guidance in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method  if objective and reliable evidence of fair value does not exist for delivered elements 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the provisions of sab no 
the ip licensing agreements generally include a nonexclusive license for the underlying ip 
fees under these agreements generally include a license fees relating to our ip  b support  typically for one year  and c royalties payable following the sale by our licensees of products incorporating the licensed technology 
the license for our ip has standalone value and can be used by the licensee without support 
further  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for support 
accordingly  license and support fees are each treated as separate units of accounting 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received 
for contracts related to licenses of our technology that involve significant modification  customization or engineering services  we recognize revenue in accordance the provisions of sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues derived from such license contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we determine progress to completion based on input measures using labor hours incurred by our engineers 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total contract fees and the percentage of completion achieved 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
if there is significant uncertainty about customer acceptance  or the time to complete the development or the deliverables by either party  we consider applying the completed contract method 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 as adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to december  was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  our espp is considered a compensatory plan and we are required to recognize compensation cost for grants made under the espp 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis for all share based payment awards  consisting primarily of employee stock options  our employee stock purchase plan and employee restricted stock units rsus  over the respective requisite service period of the awards 
for purposes of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we followed the alternative transition method discussed in fasb staff position no 
r transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
cash equivalents and short term investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities under  sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and fasb staff position  or fsp  sfas no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
management determines the appropriate classification of such securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date 
the investments are adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity and such amortization is included in interest income 
we follow the guidance provided by eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the statements of income 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the longer the duration of our investment securities  the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields 
as yields increase  those securities purchased with a lower yield at cost show a mark to market unrealized loss 
all unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields 
we expect to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity or sale 
the classification of our investments into cash equivalents and short term investments is in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
statement of cash flows 
cash equivalents consist of short term  highly liquid financial instruments with insignificant interest rate risk that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
short term investments consist of taxable commercial paper  united states government agency obligations  corporate municipal notes and bonds with high credit quality and money market preferred stock 
these securities have maturities greater than three months from the date of purchase 
we believe all of the financial instruments recorded values approximate current fair values because of their nature and respective durations 
the fair value of marketable securities is determined using quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial instruments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectability of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer and the reason for the delinquency 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
write offs to date have not been material 
while we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance  we may record unanticipated write offs in the future 

table of contents inventories we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  determined on a first in first out fifo basis  or market 
actual cost approximates standard cost  adjusted for variances between standard and actual 
standard costs are determined based on our estimate of material costs  manufacturing yields  costs to assemble  test and package our products and allocable indirect costs 
we record differences between standard costs and actual costs as variances 
these variances are analyzed and are either included on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated statement of income in order to state the inventories at actual costs on a fifo basis 
standard costs are evaluated at least annually 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
once a provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of  even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the assets  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of fair value  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for certain long lived assets  primarily fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets  for example  our ip acquired from sunplus refer to note in our notes to consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to depreciate long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we compare the carrying amount of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows  attributable to such assets 
in the event that the carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the asset s fair value 
predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult and requires the use of significant judgment 
we assign the following useful lives to our fixed assets three years for computers and software  one to five years for equipment and five to seven years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life  which ranges from two to five years 
depreciation expense was million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether impairment may exist 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company has determined based on the criteria of sfas that we have one reporting unit for this purpose 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of our company s equity as of the date of the impairment testing to the carrying amount of stockholders equity 
the impairment charge for other intangible assets not subject to amortization  for which impairment indicators exists  consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
furthermore  sfas requires purchased other intangible assets to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 

table of contents significant assumptions are inherent and highly subjective in this process 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
subsequent to the year end  the company s quoted market price of equity securities  and thus  its market capitalization declined 
a sustained decline in the company s market capitalization may represent an event or circumstance that could necessitate a goodwill impairment test between annual tests 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the subsequent period when such a change in estimate occurs 
deferred tax assets we account for deferred tax assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in the first quarter of  we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
requires that management determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
for income taxes we use an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
in general  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for valuation allowances 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets  related primarily to stock based compensation  accruals and reserves that are not currently deductible  depreciable and amortizable items  and tax credit carry forwards of million 
at december  our gross deferred tax assets of million consisted primarily of tax credit carry forwards and stock based compensation not currently deductable for tax purposes 
guarantees  indemnifications and warranty liabilities certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to the intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
at the time of revenue recognition  we provide an accrual for estimated costs included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to be incurred pursuant to our warranty obligation 
our estimate is based primarily on historical experience 
restructuring expenses we record provisions for workforce reduction costs and exit costs when they are probable and estimable 
severance paid under ongoing benefit arrangements is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
one time termination benefits and contract settlement and lease costs are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
at each reporting date  we evaluate our accruals related to workforce reduction charges  contract settlement and lease costs and plant and equipment write downs to ensure that these accruals are still appropriate 
as of december   we had million in accruals related to workforce reduction charges and million in accruals related to lease costs  which included estimates  primarily related to sublease income over the lease terms and other costs for vacated properties 
adjustments to workforce reduction accruals may be required when employees previously identified for separation do not receive severance payments because they are no longer employed by us or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plan was initiated 
in these cases  we reverse any related accrual to earnings when it is determined it is no longer 
table of contents required 
alternatively  in certain circumstances  we may determine that certain accruals are insufficient as new events occur or as additional information is obtained 
in these cases  we would increase the applicable existing accrual with the offset recorded against earnings 
increases or decreases to the accruals for changes in estimates are classified as restructuring expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oems rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of our revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and in world peace inc  comprised  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
microtek comprised  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
weikeng industrial generated of our revenue in  in and revenue from weikeng made up less than of our revenue  and innotech corporation  comprised  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors and to the extent licensing revenue increases  we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors 
in addition  we have been named as defendants in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to its business and may be named again from time to time  and although adverse decisions or settlements may occur in one or more of such cases  the final resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are incorporated into flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
primarily all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
legal matters we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred  the effect is recorded promptly in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

the decrease in product revenue in of as compared to was primarily driven by declines in sales of our consumer electronics ce products and our licensing revenues  offset partially by an increase in revenues from our personal computers pc products 
in our customers were transitioning to our newer products  this transition period resulted in lower revenue compared to in addition to our product transition  the unfavorable global economic environment impacted product revenue primarily in the fourth quarter of revenue for includes approximately million of product revenue and cost of revenue includes approximately million related to distributor sales for the month of december historically  the company had deferred the recognition of sell through revenue from distributor sales for the third month of a quarter until the following quarter due to the unavailability of reliable sell through information in a timely manner 
as a result of improved business processes  the company was able to eliminate this delay beginning with the fourth quarter of  resulting in fiscal year revenue including an additional month of product revenue from distributor sales in december we expect our business to follow normal seasonal patterns declining in the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of total revenue in was million  which represented an increase year over year compared to this increase was due primarily to increased unit shipments and the above mentioned recognition of an extra month of distributor revenue  partially offset by declines in average selling prices asp across all product categories 
we currently expect revenue to decline in the first quarter of due to the unfavorable global economic climate  however we expect revenue to begin to recover in the second half of due to the roll out of our new products  and the expected improvement in our customer s business 

table of contents our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and it helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology 
most of the intellectual property we license includes a field of use restriction that prevents the licensee from building products that directly compete with ours in those market segments we have chosen to pursue 
revenue from licensing accounted for  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in licensing revenues in absolute dollars in as compared to was due primarily to the overall softening of demand for consumer products as a result of the deterioration of the global economic climate 
the increase in licensing revenues in as compared to was primarily due to the recognition of million of revenue for the delivery of ip technology sold  which represented the million license amount less million for the fair value of support and maintenance which we are required to provide to sunplus for one year 
we completed the delivery of ip technology sold to sunplus under the license agreement and received final acceptance 
licensing contracts are complex and the recognition of related revenue depends upon many factors that require significant judgments including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances 
from time to time we enter into direct agreements for certain of our parts for certain identified end customers with our distributors who previously had the rights for price concessions and product returns 
the direct agreement converts the previously existing distributor relationship for these parts and identified customers into a direct customer whereby the distributor does not have price protection or return rights 
revenue for such sales are recorded at the time of shipment 
for the year ended december  we recorded million in revenue under such arrangements 
revenues from products sold into the ce market have decreased year over year as a percentage of our total revenues and generated  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if we include licensing revenues  these percentages would be  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in ce product revenues in compared to was primarily due to lower revenues as a result of our previously announced product transition  lower revenues from our discrete receiver chips and input processors from dtvs in our ce business  increased competition for discrete and integrated solutions from other companies and decline in average selling prices asps over the same period 
the weakening consumer demand due to concerns about the economy also had a negative impact on our revenue 
in addition  the decrease in overall ce revenues reflects a product transition wherein sales of our hdmi and products are decreasing  partially offset by increased sales of hdmi products 
the increase in the ce product revenue in compared to was due primarily to strong sales volumes of hdmi receivers and transmitters partially offset by decrease in asps 
our hdmi chips are targeted towards the dtv  av receiver  blu ray recorders  hd dvd  dvd  game console and mobile markets 
product revenues from the pc market have increased in as compared to and generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenues in if we include licensing revenues  these percentages would be  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in pc revenues in compared to was due primarily to the transition from the dvi to hdmi standard in pc s  our hdmi products carry higher prices than our dvi products  partially offset by a decline in asps in the pc business 
the decrease in pc revenues in as compared to was due primarily to lower shipments coupled with declines in asps of our hdmi and dvi products 
the decrease in asps in the pc business was due to the competitive nature of the pc business 
products sold into the storage market  as a percentage of our total revenues  generated  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if we include storage related licensing revenues  these percentages were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in storage revenue in compared to was primarily due to growth in sales of our steelvine processor chips and a slight increase in the asp s for our storage market products we have seen a significant increase in steelvine processor adoption on high end and midrange pc motherboards 
the decline in storage revenue in as compared to was primarily due to declining sales in sata controllers partially offset by an increase in sale of storage processor products

gross margin  as a percentage of revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenue in as compared with was primarily due to a decrease in revenue  lower manufacturing and outside processing costs through negotiation  increased use of our testing equipment  improved supply chain efficiencies and better inventory control offset by higher shipping and warehousing fees as a result of an increase in fuel prices 
the increase in cost of revenue in as compared to was primarily due to increased unit volume associated with increased sales partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions and cost of sales associated with licensing revenue that has not increased proportionately to licensing sales 
cost of revenue for includes approximately million related to million of product revenue recognized from distributor sales for the month of december 
historically  we have deferred the recognition of sell through revenue and the related costs from distributor sales for the third month of a quarter until the following quarter due to the unavailability of reliable sell through information in a timely manner 
as a result of improved business processes  we have been able to eliminate this delay beginning with the fourth quarter of  resulting in an increase to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year cost of revenues 
total gross margin decreased by million in the twelve months ended december  compared to our gross margin of for the twelve months ended december  increased from in  primarily due to product design cost reduction activities  lower wafer pricing and operational efficiencies as described above 
the decrease in gross margins in as compared to was primarily due to increased competition in all business lines reflected in decline in asps partially offset by increase in units sold

long term liquidity based on our estimated cash flows  we believe our existing cash and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to continue to invest in property and equipment in the ordinary course of business

while  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances together with income derived from sales of our products and licensing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future  to the extent existing resources and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
these funds may not be available when we need them  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
global credit and financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months  including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to cancel  decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 

table of contents the following represents the potential change to the value of our investments given a shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the following represents the potential change to the value of our fixed income securities given a shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and short term investments and accounts receivable 
a majority of our cash and investments are maintained with two major financial institutions headquartered in the united states 
as part of our cash and investment management processes  we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not sustained any credit losses from investments held at these financial institutions 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our investment securities consist of various major corporations and financial institutions of high credit standing 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and may require collateral  such as letters of credit  to secure accounts receivable if deemed necessary 
we maintain an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on our assessment of collectability 
foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies  primarily the euro  british pound  the south korean won  taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our future operating results or cash flows as any such increases in our currency exchange rate may result in increased wafer  packaging  assembly or testing costs as well as ongoing operating activities in our foreign operations 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices or vice versa  for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results 
cash balances held in foreign countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the united states 
as of december   cash held in foreign countries was approximately million 
the following represents the potential impact of a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the euro  british pound and japanese yen
