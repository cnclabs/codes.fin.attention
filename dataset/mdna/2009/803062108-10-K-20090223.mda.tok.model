item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
for a presentation of the financial information about the geographic areas in which we conduct our business  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing our business  operations and financial condition are discussed in part i  item a in this annual report 
integral to our service capabilities is our global distributed delivery gdd model  which enables us to perform services on a continuous basis  through client teams located in north america  europe and india 
our gdd unless the context otherwise requires  references in this annual report to sapient  the company  we  us or our refer to sapient corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries 

table of contents model involves a single  coordinated effort between development teams in a remote location typically highly skilled business  technology  and creative specialists in our delhi  bangalore  and noida india offices and development and client teams in north america or europe 
to work effectively in this globally distributed environment  we have developed extensive expertise and processes in coordinating project management and implementation efforts among the various development teams that we deploy to enable continuous project work 
through our gdd model  we believe that we deliver greater value to our clients at a competitive cost and in an accelerated timeframe 
in addition to solution design and implementation  most of our long term engagement and outsourcing relationships leverage our longstanding gdd execution model 
we derive recurring revenues from several client relationships 
recurring revenues are revenue contracts with a duration equal to or greater than twelve months in which the client has committed spending levels  which are cancelable  to us or has chosen us as an exclusive provider of certain services 
in  recurring revenues represented of our global services revenues  compared to recurring revenues in of 
additionally  in our five largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  and no clients accounted for or more of our revenues 
in  our five largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  and one client  sprint nextel  accounting for more than of our revenues 
we provide our services under both fixed price and time and materials contracts 
we price our work based on established rates that vary according to our consultants experience levels  roles and geographic locations 
our time and materials contracts include arrangements in which we perform services based on an estimated fee range or in which we cap our total fees 
under these circumstances  we assume the risk that we have correctly estimated the timeframe and level of effort required to complete any deliverables 
in fixed price contracts  we similarly assume the risk of estimating correctly the scope of work and required resources for the applicable project 
while we undertake rigorous project management throughout an engagement to ensure we deliver the project on time and on budget  we may recognize losses or lower profitability on capped arrangements or fixed price contracts if we do not successfully manage these risks 
these risks are magnified for large projects which are increasingly part of our business and multi staged projects in which we perform our scope and labor estimates  and fix the total project price from inception through implementation  at an early stage of an engagement 
acquisitions in the past few years we have acquired businesses to enhance or complement our service offerings

the sapient approach our unique consulting methodology  sapient approach  is designed to address the biggest problems that most companies face when pursuing business enabling technology and other projects the majority of projects never finish  are completed late or over budget  lack promised capabilities  or contain unused functionality 
we employ a collaborative  agile lean based delivery approach  in which we develop and release in an iterative manner usable components of a deliverable  thus enabling our clients to review  validate and commence use of work product throughout the life cycle of a project  rather than await the end of the project to realize the project s full benefits 
while this delivery approach provides clients the most value and return on investment in the shortest possible time period  it also minimizes project risk because discrete pieces of work are tested and accepted throughout the project 
by contrast to traditional consulting services methods that require heavy up front investment in time and effort to define all possible requirements  our agile lean based methodology uses actual development to evaluate and improve the design as the project progresses 
this means that unnecessary steps or features are identified and eliminated early in the design and implementation process  dramatically reducing overall project cost 
sapient approach also enables us to commit to delivering our solutions within the price and schedule that we have promised to our clients  and to create solutions that bring together business  user and technology requirements to solve our clients business problems 
we design these solutions to deliver tangible business value to clients  including increased revenues  reduced costs and more effective use of assets 
additionally  sapient approach enables flexibility in selecting the process standardization and continuous improvement models that work best for each client 
our teams regularly incorporate six sigma  capability maturity model integration cmmi  international standards organization iso and information technology infrastructure library itil processes to ensure that appropriate rigor  discipline and accountability are built into each project 
by employing these industry leading techniques  our teams establish an enduring environment of process improvement that enables organizational capabilities essential to sustaining competitive business advantage

competition the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  offshore outsourcing companies  interactive and traditional marketing agencies and clients internal it departments 
to a lesser extent  we compete with boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geography based 
with respect to our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large defense contractors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include ability to solve business problems  ability to provide innovative solutions  expertise and talent with advanced technologies  global scale  expertise in delivering complex projects through teams located in globally distributed geographies  availability of resources  quality and speed of delivery  price of solutions  industry knowledge  technology enabled marketing expertise  understanding of user experience  and sophisticated project and program management capability 
we also believe that we compete favorably when considering these factors and that our ability to deliver business innovation and outstanding value to our clients on time and on budget  our gdd model  and our successful track record in doing so  distinguish us from our competitors 
intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary consulting methodology  custom developed software and other rights

risk factors risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business  financial condition and future results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by economic conditions and related fluctuations in customer demand for marketing  business  technology and other consulting services 
the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions historically has tended to fluctuate with economic cycles particularly those cycles in the united states and europe  where we earn the majority of our revenues 
during economic cycles in which many companies are experiencing financial difficulties or uncertainty  clients and potential clients may cancel or delay spending on marketing  technology and other business initiatives 
in particular  current uncertainty in global economic conditions may cause large companies to cancel or delay consulting initiatives for which they have engaged us 
our efforts to down size  when necessary  in a manner intended to mirror downturned economic conditions could be delayed and costly 
if the downturn in worldwide economic conditions that began in continues or conditions worsen  particularly in the united states or europe  the financial condition of our clients may be adversely affected 
a continuation of the current downturn could result in a reduced demand for our services  project cancellations or delays  lower revenues and operating margins resulting from price reduction pressures for our services  and payment and collection issues with our clients 
any of these events could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  offshore outsourcing companies  interactive and traditional advertising agencies  and clients internal information systems departments 
to a lesser extent  other competitors include boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geography based 
regarding our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large defense contractors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition  than we do 
often  these competitors offer a larger and more diversified suite of products and services than we offer 
these competitors may win client engagements by significantly discounting their services in exchange for a client s promise to purchase other goods and services from the competitor  either concurrently or in the future 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

table of contents our international operations and global distributed delivery gdd model subject us to increased risk 
we currently have international offices in the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  singapore  sweden  switzerland  india  and canada 
our international operations are a significant percentage of our total revenues  and our gdd model is a key component of our ability to deliver our services successfully 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  complexities and costs in effectively managing multi national operations and associated internal controls and procedures  significant changes in immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  restrictions imposed on the import and export of technologies in countries where we operate  reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries  and changes in tax laws 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our offices in delhi  bangalore and noida  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india or pakistan or the surrounding countries  or a business interruption resulting from a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could hinder our ability to use gdd successfully and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable in india as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems  or any failure of our systems generally  could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each project 
changes to government structure or policies in countries in which we operate could negatively impact our operations if such changes were to limit or cease any benefits that may currently be available to us 
for example  although the indian government has historically offered generous tax incentives to induce foreign companies to base operations in india  new taxes such as the fringe benefit tax have been introduced in recent years that partially offset those benefits 
beginning april  the year income tax incentive of one of our software technology parks stps unit in india  and beginning april  the income tax incentive applicable to our other two units in stp in india are scheduled to expire 
this expiration of incentives may adversely affect our cost of operations and increase the risk of delivering our services on budget for client projects 
expiration of benefits provided to us by having operations based in india could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by military actions  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest 
military actions in iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest are among the factors that may adversely impact regional and global economic conditions and  concomitantly  client investments in our services 
in addition to the potential impact of any of these events on the business of our clients  these events could pose a threat to our global operations and people 
specifically  our people and operations in india could be impacted if the recent rise in civil unrest  terrorism and conflicts with bordering countries in india were to significant increase 
as a result  significant disruptions caused by such events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may be unable to perform adequately our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements 
our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
the improvement in demand for marketing and business and technology consulting services has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in marketing  business and technology consulting  particularly at senior levels 
we have been expanding our operations in all locations  and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people 
we may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our expansion or staffing plans 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we attract 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to manage adequately and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of expensive independent contractors  which may increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
we earn revenues  incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies  and currency fluctuations affect our financial results 
we have significant international operations  and we frequently earn our revenues and incur our costs in various foreign currencies 
our international service revenues were million for the year ended december  doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas  including revenues and receivables  purchases  payroll and investments 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency operating income and net asset exposures 
certain foreign currency exposures  to some extent  are naturally offset within an international business unit  because revenues and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency  and certain cash balances are held in us dollar denominated accounts 
however  due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our financial results 
our gdd model also subjects us to increased currency risk  because we incur a significant portion of our project costs in indian rupees and earn revenue from our clients in other currencies 
while we have entered into foreign currency offsetting option positions that allow the company partially to hedge certain short term translation exposures in indian rupee and british pound sterling currency  and may in the future enter into foreign currency exchanges swaps and purchases as well as sales of foreign currency options  we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies 
there is no guarantee that such hedging activity will be effective or that our financial condition will not be negatively impacted by the currency exchange rate fluctuations of the indian rupee versus the us dollar 
costs for our delivery of services  including labor  could increase as a result of the decrease in value of the us dollar against the indian rupee  affecting our reported results 
our cash positions include amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the united states could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  or changes in local tax laws  could materially impact the availability and size of these funds for repatriation or transfer 
due to our current inability to sell certain of our auction rate securities ars  the securities may experience additional declines in value  and funds associated with the securities may be inaccessible in excess of months  resulting in a material adverse impact to our income and results of operations 
our marketable securities portfolio  which totaled  at par  million at december   included ars investments with a par value of million from various issuers collateralized by student loans and municipal debt 
ars investments are principally investments with long term contractual maturities but with interest rates that 
table of contents are reset every seven to thirty five days by auctions 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
on february   certain ars investments that we held experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these investments 
due to our inability to sell these securities at auction since february   on november   we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment brokers through whom we purchased million of our ars  that grants us the right to sell to ubs million of our total million ars position  at par  at any time during a two year period beginning june  the put right 
we may be unable to liquidate our ars securities  and there is no guarantee ubs will be able to redeem the put right on or after june  should we not be able to liquidate these investments in the future  our lack of access to the underlying value could have a material impact on our income and results in operations 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues 
a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly salary expense  rent  depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 
we may reduce our profits and or incur significant unanticipated costs if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements 
approximately of our projects are based on fixed price contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials  or other basis 
our failure to estimate accurately the resources and schedule required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are consistently entering into contracts for large projects that magnify this risk 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has occasionally resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the project engagement  which could result in a fixed price that is too low 
therefore  any changes from our original estimates could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our profitability will be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our pricing and utilization rates as well as control our costs 
our profitability derives from and is impacted by three factors  primarily i the prices for our services  ii our consultants utilization or billable time  and iii our costs 
to achieve our desired level of profitability  our utilization must remain at an appropriate rate  and we must contain our costs 
should we reduce our prices in the future as a result of pricing pressures  or should we be unable to achieve our target utilization rates and costs  our profitability could be adversely impacted and our stock price could decline materially 
we partner with third parties on certain complex engagements in which our performance depends upon  and may be adversely impacted by  the performance of such third parties 
certain complex projects may require that we partner with specialized software or systems vendors or other partners to perform our services 
often in these circumstances  we are liable to our clients for the performance of these third parties 
should the third parties fail to perform timely or satisfactorily  our clients may elect to terminate the projects or withhold payment until the services have been completed successfully 
additionally  the timing of our revenue recognition may be affected or we may realize lower profits if we incur additional costs due to delays or because we must assign additional personnel to complete the project 
furthermore  our relationships with our clients and our reputation generally may suffer harm as a result of our partners unsatisfactory performance 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services 
most of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
a client s termination of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff that were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects  or client termination of one or more recurring revenue contracts see definition of recurring revenues in part i  item  above  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by unauthorized disclosures of confidential information or by our failure to remedy system failures 
we frequently receive confidential information from our clients  including confidential customer data that we use to develop solutions 
if any person  including a company employee  misappropriates client confidential information  or if client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems  system failures or otherwise  we may have substantial liabilities to our clients or client customers 
further  many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
while we have taken precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for breaches of confidentiality and defects in the applications or systems we provide and carry insurance coverage that mitigates these liabilities in certain instances  we cannot be assured that these limitations and insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations and insurance coverages are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  such claims may harm our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

table of contents our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and create liability for us as well as harm our reputation and client relationships 
the services that we offer to clients may infringe the intellectual property ip rights of third parties and result in legal claims against our clients and sapient 
these claims may damage our reputation  adversely impact our client relationships and create liability for us 
moreover  although we generally agree in our client contracts to indemnify the clients for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third party ip infringement claims associated with our services  the resolution of these claims  irrespective of whether a court determines that our services infringed another party s ip rights  may be time consuming  disruptive to our business and extraordinarily costly 
finally  in connection with an ip infringement dispute  we may be required to cease using or developing certain ip that we offer to our clients 
these circumstances could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue as well as require us to incur significant expense to develop alternative or modified services for our clients 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other ip rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our ip rights 
our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations  particularly in the second half of our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
our former chairmen and chief executive officers have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote 
jerry a 
greenberg  our former co chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the company  and j 
stuart moore  our former co chairman of the board of directors and co chief executive officer and current member of our board of directors  own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
our employment arrangements with key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and 
table of contents results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although  to the extent permitted by law  we require our employees to sign agreements prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions and joint ventures 
the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions or joint ventures that we may undertake might not be achieved 
for example  if we acquire a company  we cannot be certain that clients of the acquired business will continue to conduct business with us  or that employees of the acquired business will continue their employment or integrate successfully into our operations and culture 
the identification  consummation and integration of acquisitions and joint ventures require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we may incur significant expenses in completing any such acquisitions  and we may assume significant liabilities  some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisition 
if we do not effectively improve our operational and financial processes and systems  our ability to achieve efficiencies and cost savings may be delayed and our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
to streamline our general and administrative infrastructure and costs as a percentage of revenue and ensure that the company can appropriately scale as our business expands  we began redesigning many operational processes as well as transitioned certain internal  non billable roles to our india office  the activities of which principally relate to finance  human resources and certain it functions 
if we do not timely  efficiently and effectively upgrade or replace systems  and continue to redesign processes as our business requires  we may be unable to support our growth effectively  realize cost savings as quickly as expected or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting  which could cause a decline in the quality of our services and adversely impact our results of operations 
the failure to successfully and timely implement certain financial system changes to improve operating efficiency and enhance our reporting controls could harm our business 
in parallel with the foregoing operational process redesign and role transition activities  we have implemented and continue to install several upgrades and enhancements to our financial systems 
we expect these initiatives to enable us to achieve greater operating and financial reporting efficiency and also enhance our existing control environment through increased levels of automation of certain processes 
failure to successfully execute these initiatives in a timely  effective and efficient manner could result in the disruption of our operations  the inability to comply with our sarbanes oxley obligations and the inability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner 
a failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on the company 
we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we may from time to time in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
further  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
should we fail either to maintain adequate internal controls or implement required new or improved controls  our business and results of operations could be harmed  we may be unable to report properly or timely the results of our operations  and investors could lose faith in the reliability of our financial statements 
consequently  the price of our securities may be adversely and materially impacted

item legal proceedings we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims that have arisen in the course of our business and that have not been fully adjudicated in which the damages claimed under such actions  in the aggregate  total approximately million as of december  we have accrued at december  approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  however the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts that we have accrued 
in the opinion of management  we do not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings or claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should we fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sapient corporation sapient or the company  a global services firm  helps clients compete  evolve and grow in an increasingly complex marketplace 
we market our services through two primary areas of focus sapient interactive and sapient consulting positioned at the intersection of marketing  business and technology 
sapient  one of the world s largest independent interactive marketing agencies  provides brand and marketing strategy  creative work  web design and development and emerging media expertise through its sapient interactive services 
sapient consulting services provide business and information technology it strategy  process and system design  program management  custom development and package implementation  systems integration and outsourced services  including testing  maintenance and support 
founded in and incorporated in delaware in  sapient maintains a strong global presence with  worldwide employees as of december  in offices in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  sweden  switzerland  singapore and india 
our service revenues were million for  a increase from service revenues of million for  and a increase from service revenues of million for the growth in service revenues year over year primarily derived from the continued demand for our services from new and existing clients and  to a lesser extent  service revenues of million from our august   acquisition of derivative consulting group limited dcg 
during  we continued to utilize our india based effort on our global distributed delivery gdd projects 
our billable days or level of effort incurred by our indian people as a percentage of total company billable days decreased one point to for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in our proprietary gdd methodology enables us to provide high quality  cost effective solutions under accelerated project schedules 
by engaging india s highly skilled technology specialists  we can provide services at lower total costs as well as offer a continuous delivery capability resulting from time differences between india and the countries we serve 
we also employ our gdd methodology to provide application management services 
for the twelve months ended december   we reported operating income of million compared to million for the same period in this increase in operating income for the twelve months ended december   was the result of multiple factors including an increase in service revenues  operational performance improvement  and a decrease in costs and expenses incurred related to our review of and restatement resulting from our historical stock based compensation practices  partially offset by greater compensation costs 
our net income for the twelve months ended december  was million in compared to million for the same period in this increase in net income for the twelve months ended december   was a result of the same factors that caused an increase in our operating income 
although the growth in our business in has been positive  given the current general economic conditions  a severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the sectors and geographies where we operate 
this may reduce demand for our services or 
table of contents depress pricing of those services 
a decline in our service revenues could have a significant impact on our financial results  particularly because a significant portion of our operating expenses such as personnel expense  rent expense  depreciation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
in addition  our future operating segment and overall company revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
on february   in response to the impact of current global economic conditions on our demand environment  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our peoplecount by approximately  or approximately of our global workforce 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we expect to incur aggregate restructuring and other related charges of approximately million in the first quarter of  consisting primarily of employee cash severance payments  outplacement assistance fees and other associated costs 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
a summary of those accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services  digital marketing services and offline printing and production services arrangements with our clients when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services or product have been provided to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where the customer  at its discretion  has the right to reject the services or product prior to final acceptance  revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs 
we recognize revenues from our fixed price and time and materials technology implementation consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method pursuant to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues generated from fixed price and time and materials non technology implementation contracts  except for support and maintenance contracts  are recognized based upon a proportional performance model in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

our percentage of completion method and our proportional performance method of accounting calculate revenue based on the percentage of labor incurred to estimated total labor 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and labor applicable to various stages of an arrangement can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as services are provided 
in situations where time and materials contracts require deliverables and provide for a ceiling on fees that can be charged  the arrangement is recognized as time and materials are incurred unless fees are estimated to exceed the ceiling  in which case revenue recognition is based on the proportional performance method 
revenues generated from staff augmentation  support and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the arrangement s term 

table of contents our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor incurred and estimated total labor  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue under an arrangement 
certain arrangements provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards 
revenue related to the achievement of performance standards was immaterial for any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
revenues from contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the fair value of the elements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf no 

for these arrangements  we evaluate all deliverables in each arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
fair value is determined based on reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable 
revenues are recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand alone basis  fair value of the separate elements exists and  in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element  performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially under our control 
this evaluation is performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
the evaluation involves significant judgments regarding the nature of the services and deliverables being provided  whether these services and deliverables can reasonably be divided into the separate units of accounting and the fair value of the separate elements determined 
revenues related to our digital marketing media sales are recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a client 
in most cases  the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements  because of various pass through expenses such as production and media costs 
in compliance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  eitf no 
we assess whether the agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor 
we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment 
in addition  we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price  discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor 
because we broadly operate as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis  we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting 
accordingly  we record revenue net of pass through charges when we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business 
in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal  we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue 
our marketing services help our clients optimize their cross platform marketing effectively to track behavior and improve conversion rates through data driven analysis 
these services are provided in exchange for monthly retainer fees and license fees and are recognized as the monthly services are provided 
revenue from offline printing and production services are recognized at the time title of the related items transfers to our customers  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for an arrangement or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the arrangement 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted arrangements are made on an arrangement by arrangement basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are identified 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those arrangements 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that is too low and  therefore  a corrected estimation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue for services when collection from the client is reasonably assured  and our fees are fixed or determinable  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are thirty days from invoice date 
revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts 
table of contents invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities our investments and or marketable securities are accounted for according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we classify our marketable securities as available for sale or trading securities  and carry them at fair market value 
changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date are recorded in the period they occur 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  for available for sale securities is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value for trading securities is reflected in other income  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
investments and or marketable securities classified as available for sale are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
in the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of the business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded through earnings 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and or marketable securities in our portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and or marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
at december   we have investments in auction rate securities ars collateralized by student loans and municipal debt 
in  our auction rate securities were recorded at cost  which approximated fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset through an auction process every seven to thirty five days 
this auction mechanism generally allows existing investors to roll over their holdings and continue to own their securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
because of these short intervals between interest reset dates  we monitor the auctions to ensure they are successful  which provides evidence that these investments if carried at par value approximate their fair value 
to the extent an auction fails and the securities are not liquid  we seek other alternatives to determine the fair value of these securities  which may not be based on quoted market transactions 
on february   certain ars experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these investments 
as of december   each ars investment held experienced at least one auction failure 
due to the lack of an active market for our ars investments  there were no quoted prices and little observable market data available for us to determine the market value of these holdings as of december  as a result  we estimated the fair value of our ars investments using a discounted cash flow analysis which considers the following key inputs i the underlying structure of each investment  ii the probability of passed or failed auctions at various points in the future  iii the timing of expected future principal payments  and iv discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each investment 
at december   we held ars investments with a par value of million for which the fair value is million 
on november   we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of our brokers  to participate in a nontransferable rights offering the put right to sell at par value  to ubs  our ars position with ubs par value of million at any time during the two year period beginning june  before accepting the put right  we had the intent and ability to hold these securities until a successful auction or another liquidating 
table of contents event occurred and had previously recognized the unrealized loss as a temporary impairment and recorded the decline in value in other comprehensive loss income 
as a result of accepting the put right  we have entered into a separate financial instrument that has been recorded as an asset that is initially measured at its fair value 
we have elected to apply the fair value option in sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 to the put right and accordingly will record future changes in fair value of the put right through earnings 
we also elected to reclassify the ars investments subject to the put right from available for sale to trading securities and accordingly will record future changes in fair value through earnings 
we recorded the fair value of the put right  million  as an unrealized gain in other income  net and the unrealized loss of million on ars classified as trading securities in other income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
the put right represents the right to sell the corresponding ars back to ubs at par beginning june  and has therefore been classified as a long term asset in our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of assessing the fair value of the put right in future periods  we will continue to assess the economic ability of ubs to meet its obligation under the put right 
at december  the fair value of our investment in the primary fund  a money market fund  was million 
in mid september  the primary fund disclosed that it was valuing its holding of debt securities issued by lehman brothers holding  inc at zero  and that the net asset value of the primary fund decreased below for redemption requests received after am on september  we submitted our request for full redemption of our investment on september  and as of december   we have received redemptions totaling million 
we expect distributions will occur as the primary s fund s assets mature or are sold 
while we expect to receive all of our current investment in the primary fund  we cannot predict when this will occur but we expect that substantially all of the funds will be received no later than september   as the fund s underlying securities will all mature prior to that date 
accordingly  we reclassified our investment in the primary fund from cash and cash equivalents to marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  on february   we received a redemption of million 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas no 

sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it states that valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results for the implementation of sfas no 
r 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january  and the portion of awards granted prior to january  but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas no 
r s adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
and accordingly  generally recognized compensation expense related to employee stock options only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 

table of contents based on historical experience  we have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for stock options and restricted stock units granted 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change to reflect forfeiture assumption for stock based compensation recorded in prior periods resulted in income of  and was recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ending march   the period of adoption of sfas no 
r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management determined that using historical volatility of its own stock is an indicator of expected volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as a result of our forfeiture analysis conducted in the fourth quarter of  which considered the trend of historical forfeitures as well as future expectations of forfeiture activity  we increased our forfeiture rate estimate and recorded a reduction in stock based compensation expense of million  relating to grants made in and of the million reduction  million is reflected in project personnel expenses  million is reflected in general and administrative expenses and million is reflected in selling and marketing expenses 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all available evidence  such as recent and expected future operating results by tax jurisdiction  current and enacted tax legislation and other temporary differences between book and tax accounting  to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of operating losses incurred in and in the united states  and our inability to predict the extent and timing of profitability in future periods given current economic conditions  we believe it is more likely than not that our united states deferred tax assets will not be realized and so we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  relating to the deferred tax assets in the united states 
having assessed the ability to realize the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions  we believe that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the deferred tax assets in canada  the united kingdom  germany and india 
the establishment and amount of the valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the united states in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss in each jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as a result of the implementation of fin  in the year ended december   the company did not recognize a material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during fiscal year  the year of adoption of this standard 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for 
table of contents income taxes 
as of december  and  interest and penalties accrued were approximately million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment on a regular basis for the existence of facts and circumstances that may suggest that the carrying amount of an asset  or group of assets  may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount  the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
the standard also includes provisions for the assessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangible assets and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair value of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill  were allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification and percentage of revenue 
to conduct a goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets and operating plans and the overall economic environment in which we operate 
we performed the annual assessment of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
we complete goodwill impairment analyses at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
determining fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results 
costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use we account for costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
as required by sop  the company capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development stage  which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces  coding  installation and testing 
costs incurred for internal 
table of contents use computer software during the preliminary project stage and through post implementation stages of internal use computer software are expensed as incurred 
the capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development cost requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  technological and economic feasibility  and estimated economic life 
capitalized software is included in property and equipment and is depreciated over its estimated life  which is typically three years 
restructuring and other related charges we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf no 

these exit plans required that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates  which included contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space vacated and related costs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions and lease buy out assumptions 
these estimates include lease buy out costs  anticipated sublease rates  other terms and conditions in sub lease contracts  and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our lease buy out  sub lease and space requirement assumptions may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our sub lease income estimates are sensitive to the level of sub lease rent anticipated and the timing of sub lease commencement 
if the estimated sub lease dates were to be delayed by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional  in our consolidated statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges 
a reduction in our sublease rate would have resulted in additional charges of approximately  as of the end of if any future adjustments are required to the restructuring initiatives recorded under the provisions of eitf no 
 such adjustments will be measured in accordance with eitf no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas no 
was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas no

sfas no 
supersedes the guidance in eitf no 
sfas no 
includes a rebuttable presumption that if an entity has a history of providing similar termination benefits to employees  the benefit arrangement is presumed to be an ongoing benefit arrangement that should be accounted for under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas no 

sfas no 
prescribes the accounting for the estimated cost of benefits  including severance benefits  provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement 
a liability is recognized when the severance amounts relate to prior services rendered  the payment of the amount is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingent liabilities we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts we have previously accrued 
accounting for acquisitions our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial 
table of contents selection of assumptions and estimates 
additionally  under sfas no 
 we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on a discounted future cash flows approach 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  or the fair value of a reporting unit declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
effective january    we will account for acquisitions according sfas r  business combinations  which replaces sfas off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements

all operating segment information presented below for prior periods has been updated to conform to current period presentation as a result of these changes 
beginning in the first quarter of  we ceased allocating certain marketing and general and administrative expenses to our operating segments because these activities are managed separately from the business units 
we do allocate certain marketing and general and administrative expenses to our government services business unit as these activities are managed within the business unit 
we did not allocate the costs associated with our restructuring events across our operating segments for internal measurement purposes  given that the substantial majority of the restructuring costs were related to the initiative to reengineer general and administrative activities and the consolidation of facilities 
we did allocate the workforce reduction costs of  for the year ended december  associated with the united kingdom s restructuring plan due to the specific identification

currently  we invest the majority of our excess cash in money market funds  time deposits with maturities of less than or equal to days and other cash equivalents 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to cash flow from operations of and sales and maturities of marketable investments  net of purchases and reclassifications  of million  offset by cash paid for acquisitions including transaction costs  net of cash received  of million  the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of million  purchases of property  plant and equipment of million and repurchases of common stock of million 
we have deposited approximately million with various banks as collateral for letters of credit and performance bonds  and have classified this cash as restricted on our consolidated balance sheet at december  
table of contents at december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than one year years years years total in thousands operating leases cash outlays for restructuring and other related activities purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total cash outlay for restructuring and other related activities include minimum future lease and related payments for excess facilities  net of estimated sublease income of million under existing arrangements  excluding expected sublease arrangements of approximately million and estimated operating costs 
purchase obligations represent minimum commitments due to third parties  including subcontractor agreements  telecommunications contracts  it maintenance contracts in support of internal use of software and hardware and other marketing and consulting contracts 
contracts for which our commitment is variable based on volumes  with no fixed minimum quantities  and contracts that can be cancelled without payment penalties  have been excluded

these increases to cash provided by operating activities were offset by an increase in unbilled revenue of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in accrued restructuring of million 
days sales outstanding dso is calculated based on actual total revenue for the three months ended december  and and accounts receivable  net  adjusted for unbilled revenues on contracts and deferred revenues on contract balances as of december  and our dso  net increased from days for to days for cash used in investing activities was million for this was due primarily to cash paid for acquisitions  including transaction costs  net of cash received of million  the majority of which was consideration for the acquisition of dcg  and purchases of property and equipment and cost of internally developed software of million 
these increases in cash used by investing activities were offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases and the designation of cash equivalents to short term investments  of million 
cash used by financing activities was million in  as we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million and paid million for a bank loan inherited in the dcg transaction 
these uses of cash were offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
consistent with prior years  the company expects its first quarter operating cash flow to be negative  primarily due to the annual performance bonuses it expects to pay in the first quarter of commencing on february   certain auction rate securities ars that we held experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these securities 
as of december   all our ars  which totaled  at par  million  have experienced auction failures 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue that could result in either temporary or additional other than temporary impairments of our ars holdings 
on november   we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment brokers through whom we purchased million of our ars  that grants us the right to sell to ubs all million of ars  at par  
table of contents at any time during a two year period beginning june  the put right 
as a result  we reclassified the million ars held with ubs to trading securities  per sfas no 
 and recorded a net charge of million in other income  net on our consolidated statements of operations to mark both the ars and put right to fair value 
we will continue to reflect the change in fair value of our investments with ubs and the put right in other income  net in future periods 
we may be unable to liquidate our ars securities  and there is no guarantee ubs will be able to redeem the put right on or after june  should we be unable to liquidate the million in ars investments held with ubs in the future  our lack of access to the underlying value could have a material impact on our income and results in operations 
we intend to exercise the put right within the two year period prescribed in the offer from ubs if we are unable to liquidate these ars in the interim 
we have the ability and intend to hold the million ars not invested with ubs until a successful auction or other liquidating event occurs and they are liquidated at par 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
we believe that our existing cash and other short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and expected cash outlay for our previously recorded restructuring activities for at least the next months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we account for our marketable securities as available for sale or trading securities in accordance with sfas no 
available for sale securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss income section of our consolidated balance sheet 
trading securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the other income  net section of our consolidated statements of operations 
our marketable securities portfolio  which totaled  at par  million at december   include million  at par  of ars classified as marketable securities  and million  in the aggregate  of a money market fund and corporate debt securities 
at december   our ars classified as available for sale total  at par  million and our ars classified as trading securities total  at par  million 
at december   all 
table of contents of our marketable securities were classified as available for sale 
the reclassification of available for sale securities to trading were as a result of our acceptance of ubs s offer regarding our ars investment see liquidity and capital resources 
our ars of million are from various issuers collateralized by student loans and municipal debt 
ars are securities with long term contractual maturities but with interest rates that are reset every seven to thirty five days by auctions 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
as all of our ars have experienced auction failures since february   it is likely that auction failures will continue 
as a result  declines in value of our million ars classified as trading securities are considered other than temporary and are recorded in other income  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
if in the future we determine that any decline in value of our remaining million ars is other than temporary  the loss will be recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
further  as the funds associated with the ars may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions or our inability to find a buyer outside of the auction process  we classify these securities and the put right as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
if any of our trading securities are sold prior to maturity at a loss and or experience declines in fair value  these charges will be recorded in other income  net and could materially affect our earnings 
should interest rates fluctuate by percent  the change in value of our marketable securities would not have been significant as of december  and our interest income would have changed by approximately million for our fiscal year on june   we issued  shares of redeemable common stock which carry an embedded put option feature 
if the average common stock per share price during the ten business days ending on each of the first  second and third anniversary of june   the closing date of a acquisition  is less than per share of our share price  certain holders of the shares issued as consideration can require us to repurchase the shares at per share 
in june  and    and  respectively  of the redeemable shares were reclassified into stockholders equity when the put option lapsed 
as of december   there was no obligation to us 
exchange rate sensitivity we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the british pound  the euro  the indian rupee and the canadian dollar 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues and approximately of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies  as compared to and  respectively  during the year ended december  in addition  of our assets and of our liabilities were subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations at december   as compared to and  respectively  at december  we also have assets and liabilities in certain entities that are denominated in currencies other the entity s functional currency 
approximately of our operating expenses for the year ended december  were denominated in indian rupees 
because we have minimal associated revenues in indian rupees  any movement in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee has a significant impact on our operating expenses and operating profit 
approximately of our service revenues are denominated in the british pound 
any movement in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound has a significant impact on our revenues and operating income 
we manage this exposure through a risk management program that partially mitigates our exposure to operating expenses denominated in the indian rupee and revenues denominated in the british pound  and that includes the use of derivative financial instruments which are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of december  we had option contracts outstanding in the notional amount of approximately million million for our indian rupee contracts and million 
table of contents for our british pound contracts 
because these instruments are option collars that are settled on a net basis with the bank  we have not recorded the gross underlying notional amounts in our assets and liabilities as of december  during  we recognized approximately million of realized losses on these instruments and as of december  we had net unrealized gains of approximately million recorded in general and administrative expenses related to open positions as of the balance sheet date 
we also performed a sensitivity analysis of the possible loss that could be incurred on these contracts as a result of movements in the indian rupee 
changes of  and of the underlying average exchange rate of our unsettled indian rupee positions as of december  would result in maximum losses on these positions of million  million  and million  respectively 
changes of  and of the underlying average exchange rate of our unsettled british pound positions as of december  would result in maximum losses on these positions of million  million  and million  respectively 
positions expire in january and february of and therefore  any losses in respect to these positions after december  would be recognized in the three months ending march  for a discussion of the risks we face as a result of foreign currency fluctuations  please see risk factors in part i  item a and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item
