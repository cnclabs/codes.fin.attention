results of operations compared to overview airgas  inc and its subsidiaries airgas or the company had net sales for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal or current year of billion compared to billion for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal or prior year 
the fiscal net sales reflect a weak sales environment in the fiscal fourth quarter ended march  fourth quarter sales were billion compared to billion in the prior year  a decline of 
total same store sales in the fourth quarter declined  with hardgoods sales down and gas and rent down 
acquisitions contributed sales growth in the quarter 
due to the current year s weak fourth quarter sales environment  management has provided a separate discussion on fourth quarter fiscal versus fourth quarter fiscal below 
for fiscal  net sales increased by driven by the impact of current and prior year acquisitions and same store sales growth 
acquisitions accounted for of the overall sales growth 
same store sales growth contributed to the increase in total sales  driven by a increase in pricing  offset by a decrease in sales volumes 
price increases were designed to offset rising product  operating and distribution costs 
lower sales volumes reflect the effects of the slowing economy and the decreased demand experienced in the second half of the fiscal year across all customer and geographic segments 
the company s strategic products and related growth initiatives mitigated the impact of the economic slow down 
operating leverage and the benefit of acquisition synergies resulted in a basis point expansion in the operating income margin to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
net earnings per diluted share grew to in fiscal versus in the prior year 
the strong performance was driven by good sales growth in the first half of the year and effective management of costs in response to the slowing economy in the second half of the year 
fiscal included a one time  non cash charge of per diluted share related to the conversion of national welders supply company  inc national welders from a joint venture to a owned subsidiary  and per diluted share tax benefit related to a change in state tax law 
acquisitions in fiscal the company acquired a total of businesses with aggregate historical annual revenues of more than million 
the largest of these acquisitions was refron  inc refron  a new york based distributor of refrigerant gases with historical annual sales of million  acquired on july  with the acquisition of refron  the company formed airgas refrigerants  inc and merged the newly acquired operations with its existing refrigerant gas business 
airgas refrigerants  inc is reflected in the all other operations business segment 
other significant acquisitions included oilind safety  a arizona based provider of industrial safety services including rental equipment  safety supplies  and technical support and training  with historical annual sales of million  a n plant  a european based supplier of positioning and welding equipment for sale and rent with historical annual sales of million  and gordon woods welding supply  an industrial gas and welding supply distributor in the northern los angeles area with historical annual sales of million 
these acquisitions were merged into the operations of the distribution business segment 
the acquisitions expand the company s coverage in key geographies  strengthen its national distribution network and broaden its refrigerant gas and safety product offerings 
the acquisition of a n plant provides for increased international presence and an expansion of the red d arc rental welder business into europe 

table of contents financing on june   the company issued million of senior subordinated notes at par 
the notes are due october  and contain a redemption provision that permits the company  at its option  to call the notes at scheduled dates and prices

gas and rent same store sales declined and hardgoods declined 
volume declines were experienced in both product lines 
strategic products account for about of revenues and include safety products  medical  specialty and bulk gases  as well as carbon dioxide and dry ice 
the company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good long term growth profiles relative to the company s core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets  application development  increasing environmental regulation  strong cross selling opportunities or a combination thereof 
many of the strategic products are sold to customers whose growth profile tends to outperform gdp  including medical  life sciences  food processing and environmental markets 
the company believes its focus on these strategic products and markets will help to mitigate the impact of the current recessionary environment 
in the aggregate  these products declined on a same store sales basis in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter 
growth in medical was offset by slight declines in bulk and specialty gas and by more significant slowing in carbon dioxide and safety products 
the company estimates same store sales growth based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales  adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures 
the pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to  or subtracting sales of divested operations from  sales reported in the prior period

industrial  medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers 
equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders  cryogenic liquid containers  bulk and micro bulk tanks  tube trailers and welding equipment 
hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment  safety products  construction supplies  and maintenance  repair and operating mro supplies 
distribution business segment sales declined compared to the prior year quarter with incremental sales of contributed by current and prior year acquisitions partially offsetting a decline in same store sales of 
the distribution same store sales results reflect gas and rent same store sales decline of and a hardgoods same store sales decline of 
the same store sales decline reflects volume declines in both gases and hardgoods  partially offset by results of pricing actions executed during the second fiscal quarter and prior year 
both gas and rent and hardgoods volumes were negatively impacted by the slowdown in sales activity related to customers extended plant shutdowns and inventory reductions 

table of contents distribution gas and rent same store sales declined reflecting volume declines of partially offset by a positive pricing impact 
sales of strategic gas products sold through the distribution business segment in the current quarter declined 
among strategic products  bulk gas sales were down due to the impact of production slowdowns in the metal fabrication and steel segments  and reduced activity by oil field supply customers 
medical gases were up as hospital  specialty clinics and nursing homes segments continue to grow  while the homecare segment was more of a challenge 
specialty gases were down as plant shutdowns caused general softening in demand 
sales of core industrial gases  which experienced the sharpest volume declines  were down for the quarter 
revenues from the company s rental welder business were flat for the quarter with acquisition growth of  offset by a decline in same store sales 
distribution hardgoods same store sales declined with volumes down  slightly offset by pricing gains 
the most significant volume declines were in equipment and welding consumables 
safety product sales declined in the quarter  attributed to extended plant shutdowns during the quarter and inventory reductions 
our radnor private label line was down for the quarter  driven by the overall drop in hardgoods volumes 
the all other operations business segment consists of six business units 
the primary products manufactured and distributed are carbon dioxide  dry ice  nitrous oxide  ammonia and refrigerant gases 
the all other operations business segment sales increased compared to the prior year quarter with a decline in same store sales offset by acquisitions
