current market environment the adverse market conditions in discussed above continue to negatively impact the company s revenues 
the company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets 
fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company 
continued depressed equity valuations in will negatively impact asset management and administration fees on a year over year basis 
additionally  mutual fund service fees may be further reduced if the current interest rate environment persists 
to the extent certain money market mutual funds replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds  the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients 
with the recent decline in interest rates  the company s revenue from interest earning assets such as securities held and loans to clients has been declining more than the rates that the company pays on funding sources such as customer deposits 
the company s ability to reduce those rates has been limited as short term rates have approached zero 
if the current interest rate environment persists through  it will negatively impact net interest revenue on a year over year basis 
the level at which clients utilize margin loans will also impact net interest revenue 
while the average balance of margin loans was billion for all of  by month end december the balance had declined to billion 
the company recorded pre tax losses of million related to two corporate debt securities in its securities available for sale portfolio in certain securities available for sale experienced deteriorating credit characteristics in further deterioration in the performance of these securities  including non agency mortgage backed securities  could result in the recognition of future impairment charges

asset management and administration fees asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other asset based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients 
the company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services  shareholder services  administration  and investment management provided to its proprietary funds  and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third party funds 
these fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third party funds and the company s proprietary funds 
the company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services  which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service 
the fair values of client assets  which include proprietary and third party mutual funds  are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data 
asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets 
for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees  see current market environment

net interest revenue net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources 
net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies 
the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and  conversely  a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie  interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities 
in the event of falling interest rates  the company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest bearing liabilities 
since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients  as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients  and also controls the composition of its investment securities  it has some ability to manage its net interest spread 
however  the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition 
for discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue  see current market environment 
in clearing its clients trades  schwab holds cash balances payable to clients 
in most cases  schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment  and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue 
receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients 
margin loans are loans made by schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities 
pursuant to sec regulations  client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients 
when investing segregated client cash balances  schwab must adhere to sec regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government  participation certificates  mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association  certificates of deposit issued by us banks and thrifts  and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities 
additionally  schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments 
schwab bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients 
schwab bank s securities available for sale include mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities  certificates of deposit  asset backed securities  and us agency notes 
schwab bank s securities held to maturity include asset backed securities 
schwab bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans 
these loans are largely funded by interest bearing deposits from banking clients 
the company s interest earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients 
other funding sources include noninterest bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock lending activities  as well as stockholders equity 
the amount of excess cash held in certain schwab brokerage client accounts that is swept into money market deposit accounts at schwab bank and through may at us trust has increased significantly since the program s inception in average interest bearing banking deposits increased billion  or  to billion in from  and billion  or  to billion in from as a result  the average securities available for sale balances increased billion  or  to billion in from  and billion  or  to billion in from  while the average balance of loans to banking clients increased billion  or  to billion in from  and million  or  to billion in from

net interest revenue in included incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of us trust 
consistent with declines in general market interest rates prevalent in  the company experienced declines in the yields of all interest earning assets during as compared to and accordingly  the average interest rates on deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients also decreased during compared to and the decline in the average interest rate on long term debt was due to the additional debt issued at lower interest rates as part of the company s capital restructuring in certain interest bearing assets and liabilities of us trust retained by the company in and the excess cash held in certain schwab brokerage client accounts was previously swept into a money market deposit account at us trust
