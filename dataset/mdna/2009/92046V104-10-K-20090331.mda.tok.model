we launched ivaluerich 
com in june  we hosted our first financial expo in march  and we published our first edition of valuerich magazine in the spring of during our limited operating history  we have not been profitable 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of  our corporate mission is to create an active community of wall street professionals and small cap public company executives 
to accomplish this we will use our online and offline properties  including our global internet community  print publishing and financial events to connect the corporate and financial professionals that make up the securities industry 
we seek to accomplish this through our integrated portfolio of products and services that we now provide for the small public capitalization market place 
results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december  have been significantly impacted by our decision to revise our financial expo line of business to be a co branded or partnered expo in response to increased competition we have experienced in the financial convention space 
since we were unable until the mid second quarter to find a suitable partner to co brand or partner our expos  we did not have any expo events during the first three quarters of as we had planned  and therefore we did not derive any revenue from expos during such quarters 
throughout  we have focused on the transition of our old line financial media products including the valuerich financial expos and the valuerich magazine to web based products such as www 
wallstreethdtv 
com  the second generation of www 
ivaluerich 
com and the soon to be launched www 
valuerichtv 
com 
the new valuerich products have mostly been in design  development and implementation stages throughout the calendar year 
by the end of  we had nearly completed  but not yet launched  the second generation of the valuerich platform  which added a full spectrum of financial and web based tools for small cap companies seeking to go public and raise capital via a web based direct offering do format 
companies that want to raise capital could file their own registration statement through the do process and pay us for the use of our technology platform and access to their our of financial related professionals to assist in funding the issuing company s deal

ivaluerich 
com platform in early in january  we announced plans to create a business talk show called valuerich tv  which will be produced at a dedicated studio next door to our headquarters 
its purpose is to create a successful wall street based talk show that can be streamed over the internet for worldwide distribution 
in january  we purchased and closed on the building to be used as the studio 
other accomplishments in include entering into a consulting agreement with xi an qinba pharmaceutical co  ltd 
qinba 
valuerich received an approximately equity ownership position in qinba 
we are pleased to report that qinba has filed its registration statement with the sec and  if qinba successfully completes the registration process  qinba could become a publicly traded company 
at the time qinba goes public  it is our belief that valuerich will have an asset that will add value to our balance sheet 
in august  we implemented a stock repurchase program for up to  shares of our common stock on the open market 
as you know  our stock has become somewhat illiquid due to very light volume 
to date  the  buy back program has resulted in only approximately  of stock being repurchased in the open market 
for the year ended december  vs 
year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated  in revenue that arose from consulting services we provided 
during the year ended december   we had revenues of  our total cost of revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  total operating expenses decreased significantly from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries as a result in downsizing due to a change in our focus 
net loss for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  decreased from  to  primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues and consequently a decrease in staffing costs 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december  we had a decrease in total cash resources of  the decrease in cash was due in most part to lack of sales to offset costs and professional and consulting expenses  as well as purchases of  in marketable securities 
noncash stock issuances was  for the year ended december  we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with the implementation of our business strategy  including our revisions to our current lines of business and our future endeavors 
based on our current plans  we believe that our cash will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs at least for the next months 
because of current economic and market conditions and due to the unknown future of our nations economic health  we have taken prudent measures to manage our cash position and not force the growth of our core business 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  management expectations for future performance  and other assumptions as appropriate 
key areas affected by estimates include the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  which is based on such factors as estimated future cash flows 
we re evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  actual results may vary from those estimates 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
we place our cash with high quality financial institutions and at times may exceed the fdic insurance limit 
we extend credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition  generally without collateral 
exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition 
we monitor our exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses  as required 
accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash in time deposits  certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
marketable securities the company has designated its investments in marketable securities as trading and available for sale 
marketable securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings 
marketable equity securities not classified as trading are classified as available for sale  and are carried at fair market value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in shareholders equity

 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosures requirements for fair value measures 
the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest 
the three levels are defined as follow level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
our investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value totaling  and at december  and  respectively 
we used level inputs for our valuation methodology as the securities quoted prices are publicly available 
as of december   we did not identify any assets and liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair value as of december  fair value measurements at december  using fair value hierarchy assets level level level investments in marketable securities for the years ended december  and  the company recognized unrealized gains on its trading securities in its statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the amounts of  and  respectively

sab incorporates emerging issues task force eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the effect of implementing eitf on our financial position and results of operations was not significant 
for the year ended december   we earned revenue primarily from our expos and magazine advertising business 
we recognized revenue for its financial expos when the revenues were earned  which took place at the time of the expos  provided the selling price was fixed and determinable  and collectability was reasonably assured 
in  we have focused on the transition from our old line of financial media products including the valuerich financial expos and the valuerich magazine to web based products such as www

dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method 
under this method  options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance  if later  and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period 
all dilutive securities were excluded from the diluted loss per share due to the anti dilutive effect

recent pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas no 
revised changes how a reporting enterprise accounts for the acquisition of a business 
sfas no 
revised requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value  with limited exceptions  and applies to a wider range of transactions or events 
sfas no 
revised is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and early adoption and retrospective application is prohibited 
we believe adopting sfas no 
r will significantly impact our financial statements for any business combination completed after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which is an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented  thus requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both parent and the noncontrolling interest 
this statement is effective for the fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  based on current conditions  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value

this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years

paragraph a of statement of financial accounting standard no accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both a indexed to the company s own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
eitf no 
provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for the sfas paragraph a scope exception 
we believe adopting this statement will have a material impact on the financial statements because among other things  any option or warrant previously issued and all new issuances denominated in us dollars will be required to be carried as a liability and marked to market each reporting period 
in april  the fasb issued determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors a company should consider when developing renewal assumptions used to determine the useful life of an intangible asset under sfas this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas requires companies to consider whether renewal can be completed without substantial cost or material modification of the existing terms and conditions associated with the asset 
fsp replaces the previous useful life criteria with a new requirement that an entity consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements 
if historical experience does not exist then the company would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal including highest and best use of the asset by a market participant  and adjustments for other entity specific factors included in sfas we are currently evaluating the impact that adopting sfas no 
will have on its financial statements in may  the fasb issued sfas  the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles

this statement also does not apply to financial guarantee insurance contracts that are derivative instruments included within the scope of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement will not have and impact on our financial statements 
in june  fasb issued eitf  transition guidance for conforming changes to issue no 

the objective of eitf is to provide transition guidance for conforming changes made to eitf  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  that result from eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  and sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  early application is permitted

on october   the fasb issued fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fsp became effective on october   and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results for the year ended december  in january  the fasb issued fsp eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
 and eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets fsp eitf 
fsp eitf changes the impairment model included within eitf to be more consistent with the impairment model of sfas no 
fsp eitf achieves this by amending the impairment model in eitf to remove its exclusive reliance on market participant estimates of future cash flows used in determining fair value 
changing the cash flows used to analyze other than temporary impairment from the market participant view to a holder s estimate of whether there has been a probable adverse change in estimated cash flows allows companies to apply reasonable judgment in assessing whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
the adoption of fsp eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
