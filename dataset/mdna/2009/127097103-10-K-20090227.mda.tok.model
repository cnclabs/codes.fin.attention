we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil development  exploitation and exploration  exclusively within the united states and canada 

table of contents 
index to financial statements overview cabot oil gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development  exploitation  exploration  production and marketing of natural gas  and to a lesser extent  crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in north america 
we also transport  store  gather and produce natural gas for resale 
our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs 
our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced  with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 
at cabot  there are three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities  financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities 
depending on circumstances  we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach 
our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 
at any one time  one or more of these may not be economically feasible 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years 
throughout and most of  the futures market reported strong natural gas and crude oil contract prices 
during the fourth quarter of  commodity prices experienced a sharp decline 
our realized natural gas and crude oil price was per mcf and per bbl  respectively  in these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments 
in an effort to manage commodity price risk  we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars 
these financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy and assisted in the increase in our realized natural gas price from to commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  ngl and crude oil prices and  therefore  we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
see risk factors natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item a

we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells with a success rate of in total capital and exploration expenditures increased by million to  million including the east texas acquisition in compared to million in we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately million 
any additional needs will be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 
we have reduced  and may continue to reduce  our budgeted capital and exploration spending to maintain sufficient liquidity 
our strategy will remain consistent with we will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position 
additionally  we intend to manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity  and we intend to maintain spending discipline 
in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the east and gulf coast regions 
we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and that this activity will continue to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information for further details 
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production  the private placements of debt completed in july and december  the sale of common stock and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and asset sales 
cash flows provided by operating activities  borrowings  the sale of common stock and proceeds from asset sales were primarily used to fund our development including acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  exploratory expenditures  in addition to paying dividends and debt issuance costs 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile  including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years 
commodity prices have recently experienced increased volatility due to adverse market conditions in our economy 
in addition  fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above 
from time to time  our working capital will reflect a surplus  while at other times it will reflect a deficit 
this fluctuation is not unusual 
the recent financial and credit crisis has reduced credit availability and liquidity for some companies  however  we believe we have adequate liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 
year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million over this increase was mainly due to an increase in net income  the receipt of cash of million in in connection with the settlement of a dispute and an increase of million in cash received for income tax refunds 
in addition  cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of other working capital changes 
average realized natural gas prices increased by in over and average realized crude oil prices increased by over the same period 
equivalent production volumes increased by in compared to as a result of higher natural gas production 
we are unable to predict future commodity prices and  as a result  cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
realized prices may be lower in net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million over this increase was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for current income taxes from to primarily due to the payment of approximately million related to the south louisiana and offshore properties sale  as well as our tax net operating loss position and the receipt in of million in federal tax refunds relating to our tax return 
average realized natural gas prices increased by one percent in over and average realized crude oil prices increased by three percent over the same period 
equivalent production decreased by three percent in compared to as a result of a decrease in crude oil production  offset in part by an increase in natural gas production 
see results of operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 
investing activities 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending including the east texas acquisition and new leases in both pennsylvania and east texas and exploration expenses 
we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 
due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise  our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million from to and increased by million from to the increase from to was due 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to an increase of million in capital expenditures  including an increase of approximately million primarily due to the million east texas acquisition and an increase of million related to unproved leasehold acquisitions primarily in northeast pennsylvania 
in addition  there were million of lower proceeds from the sale of assets in compared to partially offsetting these increases to cash used in investing activities were decreased exploration expenditures of million in compared to the increase in cash flows used in investing activities from to was due to a decrease of million in in proceeds from the sale of assets and an increase of million in in capital expenditures  partially offset by reduced exploration expenses of million 
financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to this was primarily due to an increase in debt consisting of our july and december private placements of debt million and an increase of million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  net proceeds from the sale of common stock increased by million primarily due to the june issuance of common stock 
the tax benefit for stock based compensation increased by million from to  but was partially offset by an increase in dividends and capitalized debt issuance costs paid 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to primarily due to a million increase in debt  principally related to higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  million of treasury stock was purchased in compared with none in partially offsetting these increases in cash provided by financing activities were a million reduction in the tax benefit for stock based compensation  lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options and higher dividend payments 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
in december  the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the commitment period for lenders holding approximately of the aggregate commitments from december to october the december amendment added an accordion feature to allow us  if the existing banks or new banks agree  to increase the available credit line from million to million 
the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt 
management believes that we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our liquidity 
at the same time  we will closely monitor the capital markets 
as a result of market conditions and our increased level of borrowings  we may experience increased costs associated with future debt 
in july  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of  consisting of amounts due in july  and in december  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in december please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
in june  we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a price to us of per share 
this aggregate share amount included  shares of common stock that were issued as a result of the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares 
we received million in net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
these net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east texas acquisition  which closed in the third quarter of immediately prior to and in connection with this issuance  we retired  shares of treasury stock  which had a weighted average purchase price of

index to financial statements capitalization information about our capitalization is as follows december  dollars in millions debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization cash and cash equivalents includes million and million of current portion of long term debt at december  and  respectively 
includes million and million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million on our common stock 
a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in after the march for stock split  the dividend was increased to per share per quarter  or a increase from pre split levels 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  our revolving credit facility 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions acquisitions pipeline and gathering other exploration expense total includes canadian currency translation effects of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we plan to drill approximately gross wells net in compared with gross wells net drilled in the number of wells we plan to drill in is down from in each of our operating regions due to the underlying economic fundamentals  which have significantly reduced commodity prices 
this drilling program includes approximately million in total capital and exploration expenditures  down from  million in we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

table of contents 
index to financial statements there are many factors that impact our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rate 
these include reserve additions and revisions  development costs  impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods 
in  management expects an increase in our dd a rate due to higher capital costs  partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years 
this change is currently estimated to be approximately greater than levels 
this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 
contractual obligations our known material contractual obligations include long term debt  interest on long term debt  firm gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table total payments due by year to to beyond in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations including current portion 
at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt 
interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our million long term debt outstanding at december  interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december  long term outstanding balance of million will be outstanding through the october maturity date and that the short term outstanding balance of million will be outstanding through december a constant interest rate of was assumed  which was the weighted average interest rate 
actual results will likely differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures 
the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december  was million  up from million at december   primarily due to million of accretion expense during as well as million of drilling additions 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the most significant policies are discussed below 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  
table of contents 
index to financial statements geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices 
additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
since  of our reserves have been reviewed by miller lents  ltd  an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm  who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate 
we have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years 
for more information regarding reserve estimation  including historical reserve revisions  refer to the supplemental oil and gas information 
our rate of recording dd a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dd a rate by approximately to per mcfe 
revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd a rate 
it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of in one of our most productive fields would have a to impact on our total dd a rate 
these estimated impacts are based on current data  and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd a rate 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process  risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis  management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset 
if the future undiscounted expected cash flows  based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials  as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
the discount factor used at december  is based on management s belief that this rate is commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 
in  and  there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 
in the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline  there could be a significant revision in the future 
costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above  however  a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives 
average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights 
historically  the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed 
during the last six months of  commodity prices declined at a significant rate as the global economy struggled with a worldwide recession 
this price environment has resulted in reduced capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling 
we have considered these impacts discussed above when assessing the impairment of our undeveloped acreage  especially in exploratory areas 
if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year  the amortization would increase by approximately million or decrease by approximately million  respectively per year 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in the past  the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions 
average property lives in the east  gulf coast and west regions have been five  four and seven years  respectively 
average property lives in canada are estimated to be five years 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each quarterly period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective 
under sfas no 
 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges  and the change in fair value of all other derivatives  is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue  as appropriate in the consolidated statement of operations 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted those provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  that were required to be adopted 
this adoption did not have a material impact on any of our financial statements 
as defined in sfas no 
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
the transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
we utilize market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent  knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we attempt to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs 
sfas no 
establishes a formal fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to level measurements and the lowest priority to level measurements  and accordingly  level measurements should be used whenever possible 
as of december   we had million of assets  or of our total assets  classified as level this was entirely comprised of our derivative receivable balance from our oil and gas cash flow hedges 
during  realized gains of million were recognized in other comprehensive income 
derivative settlements during the year totaled million 
the fair values of our natural gas and crude oil price collars and swaps are valued based upon quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements and are designated as level such quotes have been derived using a black scholes model for the active oil and gas commodities market that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil  volatility factors and interest rates  such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term 
although we utilize multiple quotes to assess the reasonableness of our values  we have not attempted to obtain sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these derivative contracts as level we adjust the fair value quotes received by our counterparties to take into account either the counterparties nonperformance risk or our own nonperformance 
table of contents 
index to financial statements risk 
we measured the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions and made a reduction to our derivative receivable 
in times where we have net derivative contract liabilities  our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank 
additional disclosures are required for transactions measured at fair value and we have included these disclosures in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
long term employee benefit costs our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of high quality fixed income securities 
in order to select the discount rate  we use benchmarks such as the moody s aa corporate rate  which was as of december   and the citigroup pension liability index  which was as of december  we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments 
we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of at december  is reasonable 
in order to value our pension liabilities  we use the rp combined mortality table based on the demographics of our benefit plans 
we have also assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate  and reflects long term expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan 
we attempt to maximize return over the long term  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
one of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the standard and poors index over the long term 
we also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return above the rate of inflation on the total portfolio over the long term 
we establish the long term expected rate of return by developing a forward looking long term expected rate of return assumption for each asset class  taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation 
in our pension calculations  we have used eight percent as the expected long term return on plan assets for  and a monte carlo simulation was run using  simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration  which has been determined to be approximately years 
this model uses historical data for the period of for stocks  bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns 
the median rate of return  or return that we expect to achieve over percent of the time  is approximately nine percent 
we expect to achieve at a minimum approximately annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term at least percent of the time 
we believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities  fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately to for equity securities and approximately to for fixed income securities 
large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of of the portfolio 
small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of and  respectively  of the portfolio 
fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of of our portfolio 
the account will typically be fully invested  however  as a temporary investment or an asset protection measure  part of the account may be invested in money market investments up to 
one percent of the portfolio is invested in short term funds at the designated bank to meet the cash flow needs of the plan 
no prohibited investments  including direct or indirect investments in commodities  commodity futures  derivatives  short sales  real estate investment trusts  letter stock  restricted stock or other private placements  are allowed without prior committee approval 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting for stock options and similar equity instruments 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
to calculate the fair value  either a binomial or black scholes valuation model may be used 
stock based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock options and stock appreciation rights sars are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date 
the grant date fair value is calculated by using a black scholes model that incorporations assumptions for stock price volatility  risk free rate of return  expected dividend and expected term 
the expected term was derived by reviewing minimum and maximum expected term outputs from the black scholes model based on award type and employee type 
this term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the stock price volatility was calculated using our historical closing stock price data for the period associated with the expected term through the grant date of each award 
the risk free rate of return percentages are based on the continuously compounded equivalent of the us treasury nominal within the expected term as measured on the grant date 
the expected dividend percentage assumes that we will continue to pay a consistent level of dividend each quarter 
expense is recorded based on a graded vesting schedule over a three year service period  with one third of the award becoming exercisable each year on the anniversary date of the grant 
the forfeiture rate is determined based on the forfeiture history by type of award and by the group of individuals receiving the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and certain performance share awards which contain vesting restrictions based either on operating income or internal performance metrics are measured based on the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date 
restricted stock awards primarily vest either at the end of a three year service period  or on a graded vesting basis of one third at each anniversary date over a three year service period 
the annual forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards ranges from to based on approximately ten years of our history for this type of award to various employee groups 
performance shares that vest based on operating income vest on a graded vesting basis of one third at each anniversary date over a three year service period and no forfeiture rate is assumed 
performance shares that vest based on internal metrics vest at the end of a three year performance period and an annual forfeiture rate of is assumed 
expense for restricted stock units is recorded immediately as these awards vest immediately 
restricted stock units are granted only to our directors and no forfeiture rate is assumed 
we grant another type of performance share award to executive employees that vest at the end of a three year performance period based on the comparative performance of our stock measured against sixteen other companies in our peer group 
depending on our performance  up to of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in stock plus an additional of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in cash 
these awards are accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components 
a monte 
table of contents 
index to financial statements carlo model is used to value the liability component as well as the equity portion of the certain awards on the date of grant 
the four primary inputs for the monte carlo model are the risk free rate  volatility of returns  correlation in movement of total shareholder return and the expected dividend 
the risk free rate was generated from the federal reserve website for constant maturity treasuries for one and two year bonds and is set equal to the yield  for the period over the remaining duration of the performance period  on treasury securities as of the reporting date 
volatility was set equal to the annualized daily volatility measured over a historic one and two year period ending on the reporting date 
correlation in movement of total shareholder return was determined based on a correlation matrix that was created which identifies total shareholder return correlations for each pair of companies in the peer group  including us 
the paired returns in the correlation matrix ranged from approximately to approximately for us and our peer group 
the expected dividend is calculated using our dividends paid for divided by the december  closing price of our stock 
based on these inputs discussed above  a ranking was projected identifying our rank relative to the peer group 
no forfeiture rate is assumed for this type of award 
expense related to these awards can be volatile based on our comparative ranking at the end of each quarter 
we used the shortcut approach to derive our initial windfall tax benefit pool 
we chose to use a one pool approach which combines all awards granted to employees  including non employee directors 
on january   our board of directors adopted a supplemental employee incentive plan 
the plan was intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for full time non officer employees by providing for cash payments in the event our common stock reached specified trading prices 
the bonus payout of a minimum of of an employee s base salary was triggered if  for any trading days which need not be consecutive that fell within a period of consecutive trading days occurring on or before november   the closing price per share of our common stock equaled or exceeded the final price goal of per share 
the plan also provided that an interim distribution of of an employee s base salary would be paid to eligible employees upon achieving the interim price goal of per share prior to december  on the january  adoption date of the plan  our closing stock price was 
on april  and subsequently on june   we achieved the interim and final target goals and total distributions of million were paid in no further distributions will be made under this plan 
on july   our board of directors adopted a second supplemental employee incentive plan plan ii 
plan ii is similar to the january supplemental incentive plan  however  the final target is that the closing price per share of our common stock must equal or exceed the price goal of per share on or before june  under plan ii  each eligible employee may receive upon approval by the compensation committee a distribution of of his or her base salary or of base salary if we paid interim distributions upon the achievement of the interim price goal discussed below

among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of to at december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation

operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks 
see risk factors we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item a 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
during the past few years  we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast  where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued release no 
 modernization of oil and gas reporting  which amends the oil and gas disclosures for oil and gas producers contained in regulations s k and s x  as well as adding a section to regulation s k subpart to codify the revised disclosure requirements in securities act industry guide  which is being phased out 
the goal of release no 
is to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
energy companies affected by release no 
will be required to price proved oil and gas reserves using the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the month period prior to the end of the reporting period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based on future conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices 
realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production 
commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable 
the debt and equity markets have recently experienced unfavorable conditions  which may affect our ability to access those markets 
as a result of the volatility and disruption in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings  we may experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances 
at this time  we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent market events 
we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our lenders in our revolving credit facility 
derivative instruments and hedging activity our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices  but offer protection in the event of price declines 
further  if our counterparties defaulted  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
please read the discussion below as well as note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
periodically  we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production
