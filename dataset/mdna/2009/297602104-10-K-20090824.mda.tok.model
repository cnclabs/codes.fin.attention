item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto included under item of this annual report 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements relating to our future results 
such forward looking statements are identified by use of forward looking words such as anticipates  believes  plans  estimates  expects  and intends or words or phrases of similar expression 
these forward looking statements are subject to management decisions and various assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the effects of terrorist attacks or conflicts or wars involving the united states or its allies or trading partners  the effects of labor strikes  weather conditions that may affect sales  volatility in fuel  utility  transportation and security costs  changes in global or regional political or economic conditions  including changes in governmental and central bank policies  changes in business conditions in the furniture industry  including changes in consumer spending patterns and demand for home furnishings  effects of our brand awareness and marketing programs  including changes in demand for our existing and new products  our ability to locate new design center sites and or negotiate favorable lease terms for additional design centers or for the expansion of existing design centers  competitive factors  including changes in products or marketing efforts of others  pricing pressures  fluctuations in interest rates and the cost  availability and quality of raw materials  those matters discussed in items a and a of this annual report and in our sec filings  and our future decisions 
accordingly  actual circumstances and results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles which require  in some cases  that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
estimates are based on currently known facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and these differences could be material 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments  affect our consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write downs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists eg a wholesale purchase order or retail sales invoice  the sales arrangement specifies a fixed or determinable sales price  product is shipped or services are provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
as such  revenue recognition occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent retailers or  in the case of ethan allen operated retail design centers  upon delivery to the customer 
recorded sales provide for estimated returns and allowances 
we permit our customers to return defective products and incorrect shipments  and terms we offer are standard for the industry 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
retail design center acquisitions we account for the acquisition of retail design centers and related assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires application of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june  accounting for these transactions as purchase business combinations requires the allocation of purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may exceed its fair value 
we conduct our required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside our control 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
additional factors that we consider when making judgments about the deferred tax valuation include tax law changes  a recent history of cumulative losses  and variances in future projected profitability 
effective july   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which provides a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure in a company s financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
if an income tax position exceeds a probability of success upon tax audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  the company recognizes an income tax benefit in its financial statements 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a long term liability except for the amount for which a cash payment is expected to be made or tax positions settled within one year 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 

table of contents business insurance reserves we have insurance programs in place to cover workers compensation and property casualty claims 
the insurance programs  which are funded through self insured retention  are subject to various stop loss limitations 
we accrue estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience 
although we believe that the insurance reserves are adequate  the reserve estimates are based on historical experience  which may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we adjust insurance reserves  as needed  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
other loss reserves we have a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  tax liabilities  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with our counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
basis of presentation as of june   ethan allen interiors inc has no material assets other than its ownership of the capital stock of ethan allen global  inc and conducts all significant transactions through ethan allen global  inc  therefore  substantially all of the financial information presented herein is that of ethan allen global  inc results of operations our company has been severely impacted by the ongoing recession in the united states and abroad 
continued weakness in the us economy  high unemployment  volatile capital markets  depressed housing prices and tight consumer lending practices have driven consumer confidence down to  or near  historical lows and resulted in considerable negative pressure on spending by individual consumers  our primary customer base 
the company is continuing to adjust our infrastructure to match our sales volumes as we work through these difficult times 
restructuring activities in  the company made several announcements on changes to our operations as we continue to improve the structure of our business especially in light of the recent economic downturn 
in january  the company announced a plan to consolidate the operations of its eldred  pennsylvania upholstery manufacturing plant and several of its retail service centers 
in june  the company announced the consolidation of its chino  california operations into its maiden  north carolina facility and the consolidation of its andover  maine sawmill and dimension mill to its beecher falls  vermont sawmill and dimension mill operations 
for these fiscal actions  the company estimates pre tax restructuring  impairment  and other related charges will ultimately approximate million  consisting of million in write down of long lived assets  million in employee severance and other payroll and benefit costs  and million in other associated costs 
by segment  we expect million in costs for the wholesale segment and million for the retail segment 
total costs for these actions in the current fiscal year by segment are million for wholesale  and million for retail all of which have been classified in the statement of operations as restructuring and impairment charges 
approximately employee positions and contract worker positions will be eliminated due to these actions 
in january  we announced a plan to consolidate the operations of certain company operated retail design centers and retail service centers 
in connection with this initiative  we have permanently ceased operations at ten 
table of contents design centers and six retail service centers which  for the most part  were consolidated into other existing operations 
we also implemented our design team concept across the retail division at the end of the fiscal year 
we recorded pre tax restructuring  impairment  and other related charges of million for fiscal  with million for lease cancellation and other costs which will be paid out over periods ranging from less than one to seven years  million  which was non cash in nature  related to fixed asset impairment charges  primarily for real property and leasehold improvements  and million was related to employee severance and benefits 
during fiscal  we recorded a net reduction of pre tax restructuring  impairment  and other related charges of million  primarily due to net gains on the sale of real estate of million  partly offset by additional charges and adjustments to previous estimates for leased facilities of million and employee severance  benefits and other charges of million 
cumulative charges to date for these actions total million  all of which have been classified in the statement of operations as restructuring and impairment charges 
in addition to the retail charges  million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal to update the fair value of a wholesale plant site held for sale 
on september   we announced a plan to close our spruce pine  north carolina case goods manufacturing facility and convert our atoka  oklahoma upholstery manufacturing facility into a regional distribution center 
the decision impacted approximately employees 
we recorded a pre tax restructuring and impairment charge of million during the quarter ended september   of which million was related to employee severance and benefits and other plant exit costs  and million of fixed asset impairment charges 
during the first six months of fiscal  adjustments totaling million were recorded to reverse remaining previously established accruals which were no longer deemed necessary 
analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets we conduct an annual impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the first of april each fiscal year  unless events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets below their carrying value 
in determining whether an interim test is appropriate  management considers several factors including changes in the company s stock price  financial performance  third party ratings on its long term debt  and expected financial outlook of the business 
methods employed to value the enterprise and the company s retail and wholesale segments include the market approach and the income approach  which are reconciled with the total market capitalization of the company 
these valuation methods use historical revenues and cash flows  as well as company and external analysts financial projections and apply discount rates  weighted average cost of capital rates  total invested capital multiples  and premium control multiples 
fair value of our trade name is valued using the relief from royalty method 
significant factors used in trade name valuation are royalty rates  future growth and discount rates  and expense rates 
in the fiscal quarter ended december   net sales declined from the previous quarter and there was a meaningful decline in the company s average stock price from the first fiscal quarter to the second from to 
this decline coupled with the sudden and dramatic change in the business climate as seen through the financial crisis with global banking institutions led to an interim evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of these tests  management concluded that the estimated value of the wholesale and retail segments exceeded their carrying values and no impairment was indicated 
in the fiscal quarter ended march   net sales declined from the previous quarter resulting in a basis point decline in gross margin plus a further decline in the company s average stock price from to 
these declines coupled with a significant loss from operations led to a second interim evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of these tests  management concluded the carrying value of goodwill on our retail division s books exceeded its fair value 
therefore  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
no impairment of the goodwill or other indefinite lived assets on our wholesale division s books was appropriate 

table of contents in the fiscal quarter ended june   the company performed its annual impairment test on april and noted no additional impairment was appropriate 
during the quarter  business performance stabilized with net sales slightly lower than the previous quarter  gross margin improved basis points and there was a slight increase in cash on hand to million 
the average price of our stock increased from to 
the ratings on the company s long term debt were lowered by third parties to speculative grade and the company updated its forecasts 
the company considered these factors and concluded that an interim impairment test was not required on the wholesale segment 
no additional evaluation of the retail segment was appropriate as all goodwill was written off in the previous fiscal quarter 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of future reviews will not result in substantial impairment charges 
impairment assessment inherently involves judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices  costs or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions we use in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
business results our revenues are comprised of i wholesale sales to independently operated and company operated retail design centers and ii retail sales of company operated design centers 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  included under item of this annual report 
the components of consolidated revenues and operating income loss are as follows in millions fiscal year ended june  revenue wholesale segment retail segment elimination of inter segment sales consolidated revenue operating income loss wholesale segment retail segment adjustment for inter company profit consolidated operating income operating income for the wholesale segment for the twelve months ended june and includes pre tax restructuring and impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
operating income for the retail segment for the twelve months ended june and includes pre tax restructuring and impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
represents the change in the inventory profit elimination entry necessary to adjust for the embedded wholesale profit contained in ethan allen operated design center inventory existing at the end of the period 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal net sales for the period largely reflect the delivery of product associated with booked orders and backlog existing as of beginning of the period 
during the year  sales were negatively 
table of contents affected by a weak retail environment for home furnishings which we believe is due to a number of factors including but not limited to continued weakness in the us economy  high unemployment  volatile capital markets  depressed housing prices and tight consumer lending practices as well as the use of highly promotional pricing strategies by the company s competitors 
these factors were partially offset by i the positive effects of our continued efforts to reposition the retail network  ii the introduction of our new american artisan product line  iii several new marketing initiatives including the launching of our new interactive web site ethanalleninc 
com and our rewards program  and in the latter part of the fiscal year  special savings pricing  and iv the continued use of national television media  where we emphasize to clients our interior design services and the full line of our quality product offerings 
wholesale revenue for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the year over year decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in the incoming order rate as a result of the softer retail environment for home furnishings noted throughout the current period and from fewer independent retail design centers  which decreased to from including four locations transferred in to the company s retail division during the year 
retail revenue from ethan allen operated design centers for the twelve months ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the twelve months ended june  the decrease in retail sales by ethan allen operated design centers was attributable to a decrease in comparable design center delivered sales of million  or  and reduced revenue from sold and closed design centers of million 
this unfavorable variance was partially offset by higher sales generated by newly opened including relocated or acquired design centers of million 
the number of ethan allen operated design centers remained at at both june  and june  during that twelve month period  we acquired four design centers from independent retailers  and opened six new design centers of which three were relocations 
comparable design centers are those which have been operating for at least months 
minimal net sales  derived from the delivery of customer ordered product  are generated during the first three months of operations of newly opened including relocated design centers 
design centers acquired by us from independent retailers are included in comparable design center sales in their th full month of ethan allen operated operations 
year over year  written business of ethan allen operated design centers decreased and comparable design center written business decreased 
over that same period  wholesale orders decreased 
retail written business reflects the softer retail environment for home furnishings noted throughout the current year  likely offset  to some degree  by i our continued efforts to reposition the retail network  ii recent product introductions  iii several new marketing initiatives described previously  and iv our continued use of national television as an advertising medium throughout much of the year 
gross profit for fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal the million decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to a combined decline in both wholesale and retail sales volume of  partially offset by a shift in sales mix with retail sales representing a higher proportionate share of total sales in the current full year as compared to the prior full year 
as a result of reduced sales  and to reduce inventories  manufacturing plants were operated at approximately of capacity 
this resulted in higher unabsorbed costs in our manufacturing plants which were charged to expense during the period 
the consolidated gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal as a result  primarily  of the factors set forth above 
operating profit  the elements of which are discussed in greater detail below  was impacted by the following items during the twelve months ended june  and operating expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal decreases in salary related costs were experienced due to the reduced number of employees and other cost cutting efforts taken by the company that impacted bonuses and 
table of contents benefits 
advertising expenses decreased  while still maintaining our national tv and shelter magazine presence 
delivery and warehousing costs were lower due to decreased sales 
partially offsetting these decreases were i a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the march quarter and ii an million period over period increase in restructuring and impairment charges  both discussed earlier  and iii added costs of million due to the implementation of the team concept which caused a temporary overlap of expenses and is now concluded 
consolidated operating income for the year ended june  totaled a loss of million  or of net sales  compared to income of million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the decrease of million was largely attributable to i a reduction in net sales  resulting in a million reduction in gross profit  ii a goodwill impairment charge  iii increased restructuring and impairment charges and iv net declines in other operating expenses  all of which were discussed previously 
wholesale operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the decrease of million was primarily attributable to i the reduction in net sales  and ii a million increase in restructuring and impairment charges due to the actions discussed earlier 
retail operating income decreased million to a million loss  or of sales  for fiscal  from a loss of million  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in retail operating income generated by ethan allen operated design centers was primarily attributable to reduced sales caused by the weak retail environment for home furnishings  as well as the million goodwill impairment charge 
interest and other miscellaneous income  net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million decrease was mostly due to lower investment income resulting from reduced cash and cash equivalent balances maintained along with lower rates of interest during the current period and by gains recorded in connection with the sale of selected real estate assets in the prior year 
interest and other related financing costs remained largely unchanged at million from million in the prior year 
this amount mostly consists of interest expense on our senior unsecured debt issued in september income tax totaled a benefit of million for fiscal as compared to an expense of million for fiscal our effective tax rate for the current year was  compared to in the prior year 
the effective tax rate was a result  primarily  of the total current year loss before tax and the resulting valuation allowance taken against certain deferred tax assets and the inability to apply the manufacturers deduction provided for under the jobs creation act of net income for fiscal was a loss of million as compared to income of million in fiscal net loss per diluted share totaled in the current year compared to net income of per diluted share in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million  from billion in fiscal net sales for the period largely reflect the delivery of product associated with booked orders and backlog existing as of beginning of the period 
during the year  sales were impacted by a weak retail environment for home furnishings  particularly during the latter half of the year 
we believe this is due to continued weakening of consumer confidence with the current economic conditions in the us and abroad 
these factors were partially offset by i the positive effects of our continued efforts to reposition the retail network  ii new product introductions  and iii an increase in the continued use of national television as 
table of contents an advertising medium  where we emphasize to clients our interior design services and the full line of our quality product offerings 
we have made considerable investment within the retail network to strengthen the level of service  professionalism  interior design competence  efficiency  and effectiveness of retail design center personnel 
the implementation of the team concept is the latest phase of that progression  which resulted in the development of over interior design teams 
we believe that with this structure along with the emphasis in our messaging to clients that we are here to help as little or as much as they like  as well as offering the benefit of making appointments with our design professionals  we continue to improve the customer service experience 
wholesale revenue for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year

this favorable variance was partially offset by unfavorable variances related to a decrease in comparable design center delivered sales of million  or  and reduced revenue from sold and closed design centers of million 
the number of ethan allen operated design centers increased to as of june  as compared to as of june  during that twelve month period  we acquired five design centers from  and opened one previously operated by independent retailers  and opened eighteen new design centers of which eleven were relocations 
comparable design centers are those which have been operating for at least months

gross profit for fiscal declined slightly to million from million in fiscal the million decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to a decline in wholesale sales volume partially offset by a shift in sales mix with retail sales representing a higher proportionate share of total sales in the current full year as compared to the prior full year 
the consolidated gross margin increased to for fiscal from in fiscal as a result  primarily  of the factors set forth above 
operating profit  the elements of which are discussed in greater detail below  was impacted by the following items during the twelve months ended june  and operating expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with i occupancy  managerial salaries and benefits  and designer compensation largely because of our continued efforts to be located in more prominent locations and to upgrade our ability to provide professional service during the year  as well as ii the impact of higher fuel costs on warehousing and delivery 
partially 
table of contents offsetting these increases were i decreases in workers compensation insurance and health insurance and compensation costs as a result of improved claim experience  and ii a period over period reduction in the restructuring and impairment charges mentioned earlier 
consolidated operating income for the year ended june  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the decrease of million was primarily attributable to higher period over period operating expenses discussed above  partially offset by i a reduction in restructuring and impairment charges and ii a small decline in gross profit  all of which were discussed previously 
wholesale operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the improvement of million was primarily attributable to i the reduction in restructuring and impairment charges mentioned above  and ii improved performance within our remaining product sourcing operations  including a reduction in overhead as a result of past plant closures 
these factors were partially offset by an overall decrease in wholesale shipments during the year 
retail operating income decreased million to a million loss  or of sales  for fiscal  from million  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in retail operating income generated by ethan allen operated design centers was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses as a result of our continued efforts to reposition the retail network including the million restructuring and impairment charges recorded in the year 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher gross profit on the higher sales recorded during the year 
interest and other miscellaneous income  net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million decrease was mostly due to decreased investment income resulting from lower cash and short term investment balances maintained during the current period coupled with lower rates of interest 
interest and other related financing costs remained largely unchanged at million from million in the prior year 
this amount mostly consists of interest expense on our senior unsecured debt issued in september income tax expense totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal our effective tax rate for the current year was  compared to in the prior year 
the effective tax rate was a result  primarily  of the adverse effects of recently enacted changes within certain state tax legislation  increased state income tax liability arising in connection with the operation of a greater number of company operated design centers  and increased foreign income tax liability associated with our five retail design centers operating in canada and our manufacturing operation in mexico 
partially offsetting these items were the benefits derived from the manufacturers deduction provided for under the jobs creation act of and certain tax planning initiatives 
net income for fiscal was of million as compared to million in fiscal net income per diluted share totaled in the current year and per diluted share in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we held cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity under revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  the company terminated its unsecured million revolving credit facility which had never been used for other than support of outstanding letters of credit 
on may   we entered into a three year secured million asset based revolving credit facility the facility with fewer covenant restrictions which 
table of contents the company believes to be more appropriate in the current credit environment 
the facility is subject to borrowing base availability and includes an opportunity for expansion of up to an additional million of financing 
at the company s option  revolving loans under the agreement bear interest at an annual rate of either a london interbank offered rate libor plus to  based on the average availability  or b the higher of i a prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii a libor plus plus  in each case  an additional to  based on average availability 
the company will pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the facility and participation fees on issued letters of credit at an annual rate of to  based on the average availability and the letter of credit type  and a fronting fee of per annum 
the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to of eligible credit card receivables  plus up to of eligible accounts receivable  plus up to of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory 
the facility is secured by all property owned  leased or operated by the company in the united states excluding any real property owned by the company and also excludes any intellectual property owned by the company unless availability is less than or equal to million 
the facility contains customary covenants which may limit the company s ability to incur debt  engage in mergers and consolidations  make restricted payments including dividends  sell certain assets  and make investments 
the company may make restricted payments including dividends as long as availability equals or exceeds the greater of i of the aggregate commitment or ii million 
if the average monthly availability is less than the greater of i of the aggregate commitment and ii million  the company is also required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant which may not be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
the facility also contains customary borrowing conditions and events of default  the occurrence of which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans 
in addition  on september   we completed a private offering of million in ten year senior unsecured notes due the senior notes 
the senior notes were offered by ethan allen global  inc global  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and have an annual coupon rate of 
we have used the net proceeds of million to expand our retail network  invest in our manufacturing and logistics operations  and for other general corporate purposes 
in june  moodys investors service lowered our corporate and senior unsecured credit ratings to ba from baa  and standard poor s s p lowered our corporate and senior unsecured credit ratings to bb from bbb 
both rating services cited the weak economy and the resultant pressure on the home furnishings industry as reasons for the downgrade 
while the change in our credit rating had no impact on our existing credit facilities  the s p downgrade  if not improved to investment grade by march  the issuer of our private label credit cards has a right to demand a standby letter of credit of up to million 
at june   we had million in letters of credit outstanding  leaving million remaining available credit under the revolver 
any additional letters of credit would reduce the credit available for borrowings under the revolver 
the company believes it has sufficient cash and access to credit including its ability to expand the million credit facility to up to million to fund its operations and growth plans

while expenses were reduced and restructuring actions were taken to counteract these conditions  cash savings in the current year were not enough to offset reduced income 
cash generated from working capital accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid and other current assets  customer deposits  payables  accrued expenses  and other current liabilities reduction  increased cash by million largely from inventory reduction initiatives taken 
the million change from other operating activities was largely driven by the non cash restructuring and goodwill impairment charges net of tax effects recorded this fiscal year 
investing activities in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was lower by million due  primarily  to a million decrease in cash utilized to fund capital expenditures 
the level of acquisitions decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the current level of capital spending is principally attributable to i continued design center development and renovation  but at a reduced level from the prior two years  and ii entity wide technology initiatives including the new interactive website 
we anticipate that cash from operations will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures  business conditions permitting 
financing activities for fiscal  cash used in financing activities decreased million as a result  primarily  of a curtailment in payments for the acquisition of treasury stock 
on july   we declared a dividend of per common share  payable on october   to shareholders of record as of october  we expect to continue to declare quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future 

table of contents as of june   our outstanding debt totaled million  the current and long term portions of which amounted to less than million and million  respectively 
the aggregate scheduled maturities of long term debt for each of the next five fiscal years are less than million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and less than million in fiscal  and the balance of our long term debt million matures in fiscal we had no revolving loans outstanding under the credit facility as of june   and stand by letters of credit outstanding under the facility at that date totaled million

while we are not a party to any significant long term supply contracts or purchase commitments  we do  in the normal course of business  regularly initiate purchase orders for the procurement of i selected finished goods sourced from third party suppliers  ii lumber  fabric  leather and other raw materials used in production  and iii certain outsourced services 
all purchase orders are based on current needs and are fulfilled by suppliers within short time periods 
at june   our open purchase orders with respect to such goods and services totaled approximately million

retailer related guarantees independent retailer credit facility on june   we obligated ourselves  on behalf of one of our independent retailers  with respect to a million credit facility the amended credit facility 
the company had previously guaranteed on april   on behalf of the independent retailer  a million credit facility the credit facility

the agreement expires in april the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that we could be required to make under this obligation is limited to the amount outstanding under the credit facility at the time of default subject to pre determined lending limits based on the value of the underlying inventory and  as such  is not an estimate of future cash flows 
no specific recourse or collateral provisions exist that would enable recovery of any portion of amounts paid under this obligation  except to the extent that we maintain the right to take title to the repurchased inventory 
we anticipate that the repurchased inventory could subsequently be sold through our retail design center network 
as of june   the amount outstanding under the amended credit facility totaled approximately million 
based on the underlying creditworthiness of the respective retailer  we believe this obligation will expire without requiring funding by us 
however  in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  a liability has been established to reflect our non contingent obligation under this arrangement as a result of modifications made to the credit facility subsequent to january  as of june   the carrying amount of such liability is less than

product warranties our products  including our case goods  upholstery and home accents  generally carry explicit product warranties that extend from three to five years and are provided based on terms that are generally accepted in the industry 
all of our domestic independent retailers are required to enter into  and perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of  a warranty service agreement 
we record provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and make periodic adjustments to those provisions to reflect actual experience 
on rare occasion  certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
in certain cases  a material warranty issue may arise which is beyond the scope of our historical experience 
we provide for such warranty issues as they become known and are deemed to be both probable and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that  from time to time  additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of our historical experience 
as of june   the company s product warranty liability totaled million 
impact of inflation we believe inflation had an impact on our business the last three fiscal years but we have generally been able to increase prices  create operational efficiencies  or seek lower cost alternatives in order to offset increases in operating costs and effectively manage our working capital 
business outlook while we cannot forecast  with any degree of certainty  changes in the various macro economic factors that influence the incoming order rate  we believe that we are well positioned both for the possibility of continued market weakness and the next phase of economic growth based upon our existing business model which includes i an established brand  ii a comprehensive complement of home decorating solutions  and iii a vertically integrated operating structure 

table of contents as macro economic factors change  however  it is also possible that our costs associated with production including raw materials and labor  distribution including freight and fuel charges  and retail operations including compensation and benefits  delivery and warehousing  occupancy  and advertising expenses may increase 
we cannot reasonably predict when  or to what extent  such events may occur or what effect  if any  such events may have on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the home furnishings industry remains extremely competitive with respect to both the sourcing of products and the retail sale of those products 
domestic manufacturers continue to face pricing pressures as a result of the manufacturing capabilities developed during recent years in other countries  specifically within asia 
in response to these pressures  a large number of us furniture manufacturers and retailers  including us  have increased their overseas sourcing activities in an attempt to maintain a competitive advantage and retain market share 
at the present time  we domestically manufacture and or assemble approximately of our products 
we continue to believe that a balanced approach to product sourcing  which includes the domestic manufacture of certain product offerings coupled with the import of other selected products  provides the greatest degree of flexibility and is the most effective approach to ensuring that acceptable levels of quality  service and value are attained 
in addition  we believe that our retail strategy  which involves i a continued focus on providing a wide array of product solutions and superior customer service  ii the opening of new or relocated design centers in more prominent locations  while encouraging independent retailers to do the same  iii the implementation of design teams within our retail network  and iv further expansion internationally  provides an opportunity to further grow our business

sfas no 
r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after an entity s fiscal year that begins after december  july  for the company 
the impact of this statement on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows will be dependent on the terms  conditions and details of such acquisitions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exists primarily through our borrowing activities 
our policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
for floating rate obligations  interest rate changes do not affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate obligations  interest rate changes affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at june   we had no floating rate debt obligations outstanding 
as of that same date  our fixed rate debt obligations consist  primarily  of the senior notes issued on september  the estimated fair value of the senior notes as of june   which is based on changes  if any  in interest rates and our creditworthiness subsequent to the date on which the debt was issued  and which has been determined using quoted market prices  was million as compared to a carrying value of million 
foreign currency exchange risk is primarily limited to our operation of five ethan allen operated retail design centers located in canada as substantially all purchases of imported parts and finished goods are denominated in united states dollars 
as such  gains or losses resulting from market changes in the value of foreign currencies have not had  nor are they expected to have  a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
historically  we have not entered into financial instrument  including derivative  transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate or currency exposure 
however  in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  global  in july and august  entered into separate forward contracts to hedge the risk free interest rate associated with million of the related debt in order to minimize the negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings  cash flows and equity 
the forward contracts were entered into with a major banking institution thereby mitigating the risk of credit loss 
upon issuance of the senior notes in september  the related forward contracts were settled 
at the present time  we have no current plans to engage in further hedging activities
