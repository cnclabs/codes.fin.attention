item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements  included elsewhere in this filing 
overview we are a diversified reit that invests primarily in single tenant commercial real estate assets subject to long term leases to high credit quality tenants 
we focus on properties that are subject to a net lease 
see business overview for what constitutes a net lease 
we also continue to be opportunistic and have made and expect to continue to make investments in single tenant properties where the owner has exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
we have two complimentary business lines owning single tenant properties and making first mortgage loans and other debt investments on single tenant properties 
for properties that we own  in addition to high quality tenant credit  we also seek to invest in strong real estate locations that will appreciate over time 
the principal sources of our revenues are rental income on our owned real properties and interest income from our debt investments loans and securities 
the principal sources of our expenses are interest expense on our assets financed  depreciation expense on our real properties  general and administrative expenses and property expenses net of expense recoveries 
our primary business objective is to generate stable  long term and attractive returns based on the spread between the yields generated by our assets and the cost of financing our portfolio 
we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
our overall portfolio leverage as of december  was approximately 
we expect our leverage levels to decrease over time  as a result of one or more of the following factors scheduled principal amortization on our debt  voluntary debt reduction  and lower leverage on new asset acquisitions 
as a result of market conditions  we began to reduce our debt levels during and expect to continue to do so in our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
we seek to finance our assets with match funded or substantially match funded debt  meaning that we seek to obtain debt whose maturity matches as closely as possible the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term fixed rate asset financings have been in the form of traditional third party mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and two term financings  including a secured term loan completed in december and one cdo completed in march 
for assets not yet financed with long term fixed rate debt  we typically employ a hedging strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates prior to the time we obtain long term fixed rate financing 
we enter into hedging transactions at the discretion of our management team  and we may determine that it is not in our company s best interests to hedge the interest rate risks with respect to certain expected long term financings 
we entered into such a period in the fourth quarter of when we removed our interest rate hedge 
we rely primarily on equity and debt capital to fund our portfolio growth 
through december   our primary capital issuances have been our initial public offering of common stock in march net proceeds of million  a series a preferred stock issuance in october net proceeds of million  trust preferred debt issued in december net proceeds of million  a follow on common stock offering in each of may and may june net proceeds of million and million  respectively  and a million convertible senior note offering in october net proceeds of million 
summary of investment and financing activity in as a result of market conditions  we did not add any new assets to our portfolio during instead  the focus of our portfolio activity during was reducing our debt and strengthening our balance sheet 
during  we retired million of principal on our debt  including million of borrowings to wachovia bank 
we expect the focus of our portfolio activity during to be continued repayment and or repurchase of our debt 
during april  we concluded to transition financing on certain of our assets for which we had not yet obtained long term fixed rate financing  from a day repurchase agreement with wachovia bank  na scheduled to mature in august  to a longer term credit facility with wachovia 
in doing so  we were able to strengthen our balance sheet by providing additional term on the debt scheduled maturity in april with an extension option until and reduce our risk to lender margin calls 
our strategy continues to be to obtain long term fixed rate financing on these assets when credit markets stabilize and we can do so at an attractive cost 
pursuant to our credit facility with wachovia bank  the bank has agreed to make an aggregate of million of term and revolving credit loans available to us 
as of december   we had million borrowed under this facility 
we pay interest on our borrowings at prevailing short term rates day libor plus a pricing spread ranging from to basis points 
our wachovia credit facility is recourse debt 
during december and january  we repurchased million of the convertible senior notes we issued in october at a price of million  or a discount from the face amount of the notes 
business environment conditions within the united states credit markets in general and united states real estate credit markets in particular continue to experience historic levels of dislocation and stress that began in the summer of these conditions continue to impact us in a variety of ways  including by making it difficult for us to price and finance new investment opportunities on attractive terms 
as a result of market conditions  we have not been adding new asset investments to our investment portfolio 
causing us to preserve our liquidity rather than make new investments due to the lack of debt or equity capital on attractive terms 
causing a delay in the long term fixed rate financing of the mortgage assets financed under our credit agreement with wachovia bank  which were scheduled to be financed through a cdo 
this credit agreement is priced at floating rates based on day libor  or the london interbank offered rate  is recourse to all of our other assets and enables the lender to exercise margin calls primarily for credit events related to the assets financed 
we may experience increases in our borrowing costs as a result of increases in libor 
we intend to pursue a variety of strategies for the assets financed on the facility  including obtaining long term fixed rate financing when market conditions permit  pursuing selected asset sales  and retiring the debt on selected assets and holding the assets unlevered 
we expect credit market conditions to impact our ability to refinance any of these assets and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or our ability to do so 
causing us to close our open hedge position during november  for a total loss of million  as a result of unprecedented credit market dislocations and associated declines in the year treasury and other benchmark market interest rates 
widening credit spreads and limited market trading activity for real estate securities continue to result in depressed valuations on our real estate securities 
if these conditions do not improve  we may be subject to impairment losses on our securities investments in the future  and these losses may be significant 
we do not know when market conditions will stabilize  if adverse conditions will intensify or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
if market instability persists or intensifies  the trends discussed above may continue and we may be impacted in a variety of additional ways 
for example  we may experience challenges in refinancing debt as it matures or raising additional capital  margin calls on our wachovia bank credit agreement and impairment charges on our assets 
we have taken and may continue to take a variety of cash conservation measures such as asset sales  expense reductions and dividend adjustments to increase our liquidity levels until credit markets normalize 
credit market conditions have resulted in reduced trading activity and lower valuations for our securities  which could impact the amount at which and how quickly we could sell our assets if needed to generate liquidity 
our ability to sell collateral to generate liquidity could also be impacted by factors such as market conditions  the relative illiquidity of certain of our assets ie  our owned property and loan investments and limitations on sale imposed pursuant to the debt financing terms of our assets 
current economic conditions and the credit crisis may cause commercial real estate values and market rental rates to decline significantly 
these declines could adversely impact us in a number of ways  including by causing us to record losses on our assets  reducing the proceeds we receive upon sale or refinance of our assets or adversely impacting our ability to re let our owned properties 
current economic conditions have contributed to unexpected bankruptcies and rapid declines in financial condition at a number of companies  particularly in the retail and financial sectors 
these conditions could cause one or more of the tenants to whom we have exposure to fail or default in their payment obligations  which could cause us to record material losses or a material reduction in our cash flows 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
loan investments 
since our initial public offering  our loan investments have been  and we expect in the future they will continue to be  accounted for as long term investments  as our strategy contemplates that we hold the loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity 
we are required to periodically evaluate each of these loans for possible impairment 
our impairment analysis includes both a general reserve component under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and an asset specific component under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairments of a loan 
significant judgment is required in the analysis of each component  including under sfas no 
making estimates of collateral values  and estimates of probabilities of default and lease rejection rates  and under sfas no 
evaluating factors such as the status of the loans ie  current or expected payment or other defaults  the credit quality of the underlying tenants  the present value of expected future cash flows on the loans  the fair market value of our collateral  and the amount and status of any senior debt 
for the years ended december  and december   we recorded sfas no 
general loan loss reserves of million and  respectively  and no asset specific loan loss reserves  although we did record a loss of charged to the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december   related to the write off in full of a development loan investment 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we allocate the purchase price of rental real estate acquired to the following based on fair values acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of above market and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence activities and other market data  and utilize various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant the dark value 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the differences between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease 
fair market lease rates are measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market rate renewal options for below market leases 
in computing present value  we consider the costs which would need to be invested to achieve the fair market lease rates 
we use a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market renewal options of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include in place leases and tenant relationships which are valued based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of the dark value of the property  carrying costs during the hypothetical expected time it would take management to find a tenant to lease the space for the existing lease term a lease up period considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
management estimates carrying costs  including such factors as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses during the expected lease up period  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships 
through december   we have assigned no value to tenant relationships on any of our acquisitions 
commercial mortgage backed securities 
we account for our investments in securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we estimate the fair value on all securities investments quarterly 
the fair values of cmbs are determined in most cases primarily by reference to index pricing 
management may also estimate fair value based on credit characteristics and term of the security  market yields on securities with similar credit ratings  and collateral values 
management has obtained broker quotes  but believes that in most cases the broker quotes reflect expected pricing for distressed trades in inactive and dislocated markets  rather than actual prices in orderly transactions 
management has ultimately determined the fair values recorded in the financial statements based on a variety of factors  and in most cases those fair values are significantly above the broker quotes 
our estimates of fair value are subject to significant variability based on market conditions  including interest rates and credit spreads 
we must also assess whether any unrealized losses on securities below our carry value reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary 
if so  we must write the impaired security down to its fair value through a charge to our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
the current market dislocations have made these judgments even more challenging 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider whether the decline is due to factors such as changes in interest rates or credit spreads indicator of temporary decline or credit rating downgrades on the securities or credit defaults on the underlying collateral assets indicator of an other than temporary decline 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the financial condition and near term prospects of the underlying credit  our intent and ability to retain our investment in the underlying credit for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value and the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost 
we recorded other than temporary declines in the fair value of our cmbs securities of million in  million for  and million for impairment on owned real properties 
we own real properties for investment 
we review these properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon determination of impairment  we would record a write down of the asset  which would be charged to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting write down  including an evaluation of factors such as the credit quality of the tenant  the anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  and an estimate of what lease rents will be if the property is vacated coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
however  these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
through december   we have determined that no write downs have been necessary on any of our owned real properties  other than a million impairment loss on our cott property recorded in the quarter ended september  derivative instruments and other risk management transactions 
our derivative instruments and other risk management transactions  which we hold for hedging or other risk management purposes  are carried at fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
fair value is based on market quotations 
fair values on such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as our securities available for sale discussed above 
further  to the extent the derivatives qualify as hedges under sfas no 
 net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity on our balance sheet  otherwise  they are reported as a component of current income or loss on our statement of operations 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  our derivatives must meet various technical requirements under sfas  including satisfying hedge effectiveness testing at each reporting date 
failure to meet these requirements would result in the change in value of the derivative instrument being charged directly to our statement of operations without any offset from the change in fair value of the related hedged transaction 
our hedging transactions may not perform as expected  including during periods of market dislocation 
for example  as a result of unprecedented credit market dislocations and associated declines in the year treasury and other benchmark market interest rates  we concluded to close our only open hedge position during november  resulting in a loss charged directly to our statement of operations during the quarter ended december   of million 
we currently have no open hedge positions 
stock based compensation 
pursuant to our stock incentive plan  we have made and expect to continue to make awards of common stock to our employees with vesting subject to attainment of performance criteria 
under sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  we are required to estimate the probability of vesting of these shares quarterly and recognize expense generally equal to the fair market value of the shares awarded on the grant date for any shares deemed probable to vest over the period the employee is required to perform services to receive the shares 
we base our estimates of probability on an assessment of our actual results against the relevant performance criteria 
these estimates may change over time as our actual results against the criteria are re assessed 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the expense we recognize 
property acquisitions during the quarter ended december   we did not make any new investments 
we also did not complete any new asset financings 
business segments we conduct our business through two operating segments operating real estate including our investments in owned real properties  and lending investments including our loan investments as well as our investments in securities 
segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses and minority interest gain on extinguishment of debt income loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses and minority interest gain on extinguishment of debt income loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses and minority interest income loss from continuing operations total assets comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rental revenue 
rental revenue and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million  or  to million 
the increase was driven by a full year of rental revenue from the entrecap portfolio which was acquired in april interest income was basically unchanged  decreasing million  or  to million 
expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to the large loss on derivatives  and higher levels of depreciation and amortization expense on real property  loss on investments  general and administrative expenses  property expenses and interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily the result of million of additional interest expense on the secured term loan we issued in december  million of additional interest expense on the convertible senior notes we issued in october  and million of additional interest expense on property mortgages  partially offset by million of lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings resulting from lower borrowings and interest rates in and the impact in of million of fees and million of interest expense under the bridge facility we entered into in connection with the acquisition of the entrecap portfolio in april 
our average balance outstanding and effective financing rate under our floating rate borrowings other than the bridge facility was approximately million at during average day libor of  compared with approximately million at during average day libor of 
depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million  or  to million  as a result of the additional real estate investments made during property expense increased million  or  to million 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries was million  compared to million in the growth in property expenses reflects the growth of our portfolio as well as our purchase of properties with greater overall exposure to property expenses under the lease provisions  primarily with respect to leases with the united states government 
while our investment focus continues to be on net leased properties  we expect to continue to pursue properties where we have exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
we had a million loss on derivatives in the period  compared to of income in the period 
the loss in the period relates primarily to million of losses we realized in november when we closed our only open hedge position 
as of december  and during most of  we had a single open interest rate swap  intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements for a planned long term financing of assets financed on our interim financing facility with wachovia bank 
during november  we closed the swap as a result of unprecedented credit market dislocations and associated declines in the year treasury and other benchmark market interest rates 
under sfas no 
 the full amount of the realized loss on closing the swap of million  along with million of related losses previously deferred in other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet  was charged directly to our consolidated statement of operations  as the swap position no longer represented an effective cash flow hedge under sfas no 
we currently have no open hedge positions 
loss on investments increased million  to million in  from million in losses in reflect the million write off of the investment in matapeake in the fourth quarter see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k  the million impairment loss on securities investments in the fourth quarter see note  the million write off of a development loan in the third quarter see note  a million general reserve for loan losses in the fourth quarter see note  and the million impairment loss on the cott property in the third quarter see note 
losses in reflect impairment losses on two cmbs securities during the second quarter of see note 
management determined that other than temporary declines in the fair value below cost basis had occurred on these two investments 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million to million  primarily reflecting higher legal expenses associated with litigation  including the actions we brought related to the real property we own in johnston  rhode island and lease to factory mutual insurance company 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation increased million  as a result of an additional year of stock awards amortizing to expense in  offset in part by a lower vesting percentage for performance based awards in as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
as of december   the grant date fair value for awards of  shares made in   shares made in   shares made in and  shares made in  had not yet been determined because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance had not yet occurred 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
we had million of non cash gains on extinguishment of debt in  compared to million in the period 
gains in the period related to the repurchase of our convertible senior notes in december  and the gains in the period related to our retirement of debt we assumed when we purchased the entrecap portfolio 
the gains in the period resulted from interest rate changes between the date we assumed the debt and the date it was repaid 
net loss 
net loss increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of the loss on derivatives in the period 
net loss allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rental revenue and property expense recoveries and an increase in interest income  offset in part by decreases in gain on sale of loans and securities and other revenue 
rental revenue and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million  or  to million 
we continued to make significant investments in owned properties during  and the significant increase in revenues associated with these investments is a result of the large growth in this portion of our overall investment portfolio during and interest income increased million  or  to million 
the increase was due to modestly larger overall aggregate loan and security investments 
we had no gains on sale of mortgage loans and securities in  compared to gains of million during the activity reflected gains on the sale of securities in the fourth quarter of million and a gain we earned on the origination and sale of a mortgage loan in the first quarter of million 
other revenue decreased million  or  from million to million  primarily reflecting income we received on loans that were paid off in expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to higher levels of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense on real property  property expenses and general and administrative expenses  and losses on two cmbs investments  offset in part by a reduction in stock based compensation expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily the result of million of increased interest expense on our property mortgages originated or assumed in and  million of additional interest expense under our repurchase agreement primarily resulting from higher borrowings and interest rates in  million of fees paid under the bridge facility we entered into in connection with the acquisition of the entrecap portfolio  million of interest expense under the bridge facility  million of interest expense on the convertible senior notes we issued in october  and million of interest expense on the secured term loan we issued in december our average balance outstanding under the repurchase agreement was approximately million during  compared with approximately million during depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million  or  to million  as a result of the significant increase in real estate investments made during and property expense increased million  or  to million

loss on investments decreased million  to million in  from million in losses in reflect impairment losses on two cmbs securities during the second quarter of management determined that other than temporary declines in the fair value below cost basis had occurred on these two investments 
losses in relate to write downs we took on our securities as a result of exposure to the winn dixie bankruptcy 
the losses in both periods are discussed at note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million to million  primarily reflecting higher employee compensation due to increased headcount and higher legal expenses primarily associated with the retirement of debt we assumed upon acquisition of the entrecap portfolio 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation decreased million  as our transition to a five year vesting period and a lower vesting percentage for performance based awards in offset an additional year of stock awards amortizing to expense 
as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
as of december   the grant date fair value for awards of  shares made in   shares made in  and  shares made in had not yet been determined because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance had not yet occurred 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
we had million of non cash gains on extinguishment of debt in the period  relating to our retirement of debt we assumed when we purchased the entrecap portfolio 
these gains resulted from interest rate changes between the date we assumed the debt and the date it was repaid 
net income loss 
net income loss decreased from million to million  primarily as a result of increases in interest expense  depreciation expense and property expenses  offset in part by an increase in rental revenues and property expense recoveries 
net loss allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
circuit city exposure circuit city stores  inc circuit city filed for bankruptcy protection in november  and  on january   announced its intention to liquidate its assets 
the company does not own any properties leased to circuit city and does not have any loan investments where circuit city is the underlying tenant 
the company does own investments in three commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs transactions containing a total of amortizing first mortgage loans each on a single tenant retail store net leased to circuit city 
each loan is secured by a first mortgage on the borrower s ownership interest in the property and an assignment of the borrower s lease with circuit city 
at this time  any estimate of the impact of the circuit city bankruptcy on securities the company owns is subject to a variety of assumptions 
circuit city may sell or assign its interest in one or more of the subject leases or the borrower may choose to protect its investment in the property by making the scheduled payments under the loan 
assuming a default under one or more of the loans  any estimate of the loss to the trust reflects assumptions such as the amount that will be recovered from the property in connection with a foreclosure on the mortgage  the amount that will be recovered in bankruptcy on the unsecured claim for unpaid rent under the lease  and the amount of any reserve deposited in the trust to absorb losses on the collateral 
additional detail about the company s exposure to circuit city is described below

we believe ffo is a useful additional measure of our performance because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for real estate depreciation  a non cash expense which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in addition  we believe that ffo provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance as compared to other reits  since ffo is generally recognized as an industry standard for measuring the operating performance of an equity reit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the following table reconciles our net income loss allocable to common stockholders to ffo for the years ended december   december  and december  year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss allocable to common stockholders adjustments add minority interest op units add depreciation and amortization expense on real property funds from operations weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted weighted average number of op units outstanding weighted average number of common shares and op units outstanding  diluted net income loss per common share  basic and diluted funds from operations per share gain on sale of mortgage loans and securities liquidity and capital resources we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
leverage also exposes us to a variety of risks which are discussed in more detail in our most recent annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
our overall portfolio leverage as of december  was approximately 
we expect our leverage levels to decrease over time  as a result of one or more of the following factors scheduled principal amortization on our debt  voluntary debt reduction  and lower leverage on new asset acquisitions 
as a result of market conditions  we began to reduce our debt levels during and expect to continue to do so in our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
we seek to finance our assets with match funded or substantially match funded debt  meaning that we seek to obtain debt whose maturity matches as closely as possible the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term fixed rate asset financings have been in the form of traditional third party mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and two term financings  including a secured term loan completed in december and one cdo completed in march 
as of december   we have financed on a long term basis an aggregate of approximately billion of portfolio assets with third party mortgage debt of million and term financings of million 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis  and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
we declared total dividends of per share of common stock during the year ended december   including per share in each of the first  second and third quarters 
we did not declare a dividend on our common stock in the fourth quarter of we declared a dividend of per share of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in each of the first  second  third and fourth quarters of our dividend policy is subject to revision at the discretion of our board of directors 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our cash available for distribution  our funds from operations  our maintenance of reit status  market conditions and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
short term liquidity and financing 
we expect that our short term liquidity requirements will be met generally through our available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  and  to the extent we make new investments  through revolving loan borrowings under our credit agreement with wachovia bank discussed below 
we expect that our short term liquidity requirements will also be met through a portion of the proceeds from any issuances of debt and or equity capital 
our ability to issue debt or equity capital is currently being adversely impacted by the factors discussed under business environment above 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as of march   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
on april   we entered into a credit agreement with wachovia bank 
pursuant to the agreement  wachovia bank agreed to make an aggregate of million of term and revolving credit loans available to us 
we drew a million term loan upon closing of the borrowing facility and may make draws of revolving credit loans from time to time during the agreement term to finance commercial real estate assets that are approved by the wachovia bank in its discretion 
the credit agreement is for a term of two years with a one year extension option at our option provided we meet certain conditions including reducing our borrowings to million by the scheduled maturity date in april 
we can prepay our borrowings under the facility in whole or in part at any time subject to a million minimum without any penalty or premium 
we are required to use a portion of our future debt or equity issuances to prepay borrowings under the facility 
we are required to pay interest on our borrowings at prevailing short term rates day libor plus a pricing spread ranging from to basis points 
in connection with the financing transaction  we also agreed to consolidate our existing lending arrangements with wachovia bank into this facility and  as a result  our prior million repurchase agreement and a million revolving loan agreement were terminated 
our borrowings under the facility are secured by the same collateral that previously secured our obligations under the repurchase agreement and million revolver  which includes a combination of first mortgage loan investments  intercompany mortgage loans on our owned property investments  commercial mortgage backed securities and a first lien on our ownership interest in the real property located in johnston  rhode island and leased to factory mutual insurance company 
our obligations under the credit agreement are also fully recourse to all of our other assets 
in the event wachovia determines in its sole discretion that the value of our collateral assets has declined  including as a result of an underlying tenant credit rating downgrade or other adverse tenant credit event  wachovia may require us to prepay a portion of our borrowings  provided that wachovia may not reduce the value of any of our collateral other than cmbs securities due to general credit spread or interest rate fluctuations 
we are required to comply with the following financial covenants under the credit agreement minimum liquidity as defined in the agreement of at least million  and minimum consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the agreement of at least million plus of the aggregate net proceeds from equity offerings or capital contributions after september  we repaid million of debt it owed to wachovia upon closing of the credit facility 
during september  we used a portion of the net proceeds from a common stock issuance to repay million of borrowings under the credit agreement 
we had million outstanding as of december  under our wachovia credit agreement  which borrowings were secured by loan investments with an aggregate carry value of million  intercompany mortgage loans and investments in our cdo with an aggregate carry value of million  cmbs investments with a carry value of million and a single owned property with a carry value of million 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million borrowed against assets that wachovia classifies as cmbs for purposes of the credit agreement and  therefore  are subject to margin call risk due to general credit spread and interest rate fluctucations 
as of march   we had further reduced borrowings against these assets to million 
long term liquidity and financing 
we expect that our long term liquidity requirements will be met generally through cash provided by operations  long term fixed rate financings on our asset investments and issuances of debt and equity capital 
our ability to obtain long term financings and to issue debt or equity capital is currently being adversely impacted by the factors discussed under business environment above 
we may also selectively sell assets to help us to meet our long term liquidity needs 
our primary long term liquidity requirement is repayment of our debt obligations 
we estimate that we will need to generate approximately million of liquidity to extend our term loan with wachovia until april  and we expect to be able to do so through a combination of cash from operations and asset sales 
if we are unable to extend the term loan  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
through december   our primary capital issuances have been our initial public offering of common stock in march net proceeds of million  a series a preferred stock issuance in october net proceeds of million  trust preferred debt issued in december net proceeds of million  a follow on common stock offering in each of may and may june net proceeds of million and million  respectively  and a million convertible senior note offering in october net proceeds of million 
during december and january  we repurchased million of the convertible senior notes at a price of million  or a discount from the face amount of the notes 
in march  we implemented a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
the plan provides us with an additional source of equity capital 
the plan allows interested stockholders to reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares of our common stock and to make monthly purchases of our common stock generally up to a maximum of  unless a higher amount is approved by us in our sole discretion 
shares purchased through the plan may be either i newly issued by us or ii purchased by the plan administrator in the open market  at our discretion 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock through the plan at an average price of per share 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock through the plan at an average price of per share 
as of december   we have reserved an aggregate of  shares of common stock for future issuance pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
we are not currently issuing new shares through the plan  although we reserve the right to elect to do so in our sole discretion at any time in the future 
during september  we raised million of net proceeds through an issuance of  shares of common stock to an existing greater than stockholder at a price of per share 
we issued the shares off of our shelf registration statement 
we intend to continue to raise additional capital from time to time to enable us to continue to implement our strategy 
our ability to raise capital is influenced by market conditions  and we cannot assure you that conditions for raising capital will be favorable for us at any time 
as of december   we have an effective shelf registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock and or senior or subordinated debt securities from time to time 
long term mortgage financings 
during the year ended december   we did not obtain any new mortgage financings 
our mortgage financings are fixed rate financings 
the notes typically mature over a long term period of approximately ten years  and debt service is payable monthly 
the notes are non recourse to us subject to limited recourse exceptions and are secured by a mortgage on the property and an assignment of the underlying lease and rents on the property 
the notes are often interest only for all or a portion of the note term  and thus require a balloon payment at maturity 
our ability to fund a balloon payment will be dependent upon our ability to refinance the debt and or sell the related property 
market conditions will impact our ability to refinance debt and sell assets 
see business environment and item a risk factors above 
term financings 
in december  we completed a million original principal balance secured term loan 
upon closing of the financing  we pledged approximately million principal amount of collateral to secure our obligations under the loan 
the interest coupon on the loan is fixed at annually until the loan matures in january our effective financing rate on the loan is annually inclusive of hedge and closing costs 
the loan is non recourse to us  subject to limited non recourse exceptions 
we also completed an entirely fixed rate cdo financing in march we aggregated approximately million of assets and then transferred these assets into a wholly owned securitization vehicle  and issued million face amount of multi class notes and million of preferred equity through the securitization vehicle 
the assets serve as collateral for our obligations under the notes 
the securitization vehicle is an spe  with its business limited to the issuance of the notes and the preferred equity  the acquisition of the collateral and certain other matters related thereto 
the net amount of the debt we issued was million  inclusive of a million discount to face  as we retained the three most junior note classes aggregating a face amount of million and the full million of preferred equity 
each of the five note classes of the cdo was and continues to be rated investment grade 
through october  we expect to reinvest principal repayments on the underlying assets into qualifying replacement collateral 
the cdo notes have a stated maturity in january  but are expected to mature in january when the notes become subject to an auction call procedure 
our weighted average effective financing rate inclusive of original issue discount and debt issuance and hedge costs on our cdo is approximately 
our cdo debt is non recourse to us but is secured by the collateral assets 
we entered into a million two year credit agreement with an option for an additional year with wachovia bank on april  the agreement is a floating rate libor based facility 
at closing  we refinanced the assets previously financed on our short term repurchase agreement into this facility 
we intend to pursue a variety of strategies for the assets financed on the facility  including obtaining long term fixed rate financing when market conditions permit  pursuing selected asset sales  and retiring the debt on selected assets and holding the assets unlevered 
we expect credit market conditions to impact our ability to refinance any of these assets and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or our ability to do so 
statement of cash flows operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by net loss before the loss on derivatives and as adjusted by various non cash gains  income and charges of million and decreases in other assets of million 
operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by net income as adjusted by various non cash gains  income and charges of million and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  partially offset by increases in other assets of million 
operating activities provided million of cash during  primarily driven by net income as adjusted by various non cash gains and charges of million  increases in accounts payable of million and decreases in other assets of million  partially offset by decreases in deposits and escrows of million 
we recognize rental income on our owned properties on a straight line basis in accordance with sfas as of december   this has resulted in us accruing million of rental income in excess of actual rents due under the various leases 
during the year ended december   rents on a straight line basis exceeded actual rents due under the leases by million 
we expect the impact of straight lining of rents to fluctuate over time as contractual rents step up and actual rents due increase under the various leases and we purchase additional properties 
certain of our owned properties are also subject to rents which pay semi annually  rather than monthly  and this also impacts the quarter to quarter changes due to straight lining of rents 
investing activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   which primarily resulted from principal received on loans of million and securities of million 
investing activities used million during the year ended december   which primarily resulted from net investments in real estate of million  investments in securities available for sale of million  investments in loans of million and investments in partially owned entities of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales of real estate investments of million and principal received on loans of million and securities of million 
investing activities used million during the year ended december   which primarily resulted from net investments in real estate of million  net investments in securities available for sale of million  and purchases of furniture  fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements of million  partially offset by a net reduction in our loan investments of million 
we sold a mortgage loan for million during cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  which primarily resulted from net repayments of principal on debt of million net of million on the wachovia repurchase agreement and credit facility  net of million on property mortgages and million on the secured term loan with kbc bank  dividends and distributions paid of million  and cash paid in hedging activities of million  partially offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of million 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  which primarily resulted from net borrowings of million  including borrowings of million under a secured term loan  million under convertible senior notes  million under the repurchase agreement net of repayments and million under mortgages on real estate investments  proceeds from common stock issuances of million and funds provided by hedging and risk management activities of million  partially offset by dividends and distributions paid of million  common stock repurchased of million and debt issuance costs of million 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  reflecting net borrowings from mortgages on real estate investments of million  net borrowings on repurchase agreements and other short term financing obligations of million  proceeds from our common stock offering of million  and cash received from a construction escrow held by our mortgage lender of million  offset in part by  dividends and distributions paid of million and debt issuance costs of million 
see our consolidated statements of cash flows in the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for a reconciliation of our cash position for the periods described above 
risk management transactions since our initial public offering  we have employed a hedging strategy to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations prior to the time we obtain long term fixed rate financing for our assets 
our risk management activities during this period have consisted primarily of interest rate swaps  and we expect they will continue to consist primarily of interest rate swaps in the future  although we may utilize other instruments 
we may determine that it is not in our company s best interests to hedge the interest rate risks with respect to certain expected long term financings  particularly during periods of market dislocation 
in accordance with sfas  the interest rate swaps are treated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes to the extent that they have been designated and qualify as such 
the effective portion of our realized and unrealized gains and losses on such transactions are treated as a component of other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet and are not reported as a component of current income or loss on our consolidated statement of operations 
the effective portion of our realized gains and losses  which generally represent the net payments we make or receive on the interest rate swaps  are then reclassified and amortized as part of interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations beginning at issuance of the related debt and continuing over the expected term of such issuance 
to the extent the sfas no 
cash flow hedge criteria are not met or the hedge is deemed ineffective  some or all of the realized and unrealized gains and losses on such transactions are treated as a component of current income or loss on our consolidated statement of operations 
no assurance can be made that we will continue to satisfy the cash flow hedge requirements of sfas no 
and as to the portion of our gains and losses that will be deemed effective under sfas no 
changes in management s initial assumptions regarding the proposed debt issuance eg  timing and the amount and type of debt and changes in the shape of the swap curve are among the factors that could cause us to include a greater portion of our gains and losses from the associated risk management transactions as current income or loss 
during november  we closed our only open hedge position as a result of unprecedented credit market dislocations and associated declines in the year treasury and other benchmark market interest rates 
under sfas no 
 the full amount of the realized loss on closing the swap of million  along with million of related losses previously deferred in other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet  was charged directly to our consolidated statement of operations  as the hedge position no longer represented an effective cash flow hedge under sfas no 
we settle our derivative and other risk management transactions in cash 
therefore  upon settlement  we will pay or receive cash for the net amount due 
these amounts could be material and could have a material impact positive or negative on our liquidity 
since april  our counterparty has required that we deposit cash to collateralize substantially all amounts we may owe at settlement of an open hedge 
see note in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional discussion of our hedging and risk management transactions 
as discussed above  we closed our only open hedge position during november  and we had no open hedging and risk management transactions as of december  contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years mortgages on real estate investments collateralized debt obligations credit facility secured term loan convertible senior notes other long term debt operating leases total we expect that the reinvestment feature of our cdo will enable us to reinvest about million of principal repaid on assets financed in the cdo into new assets in  and we currently intend to apply this amount to assets financed on the credit facility 
negative amounts shown with respect to our collateralized debt obligations represent amortization of original issue discount 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements 
in april  we agreed to invest in matapeake partners llc  a real estate investment and management company 
as of december   we had an outstanding commitment to fund up to million of additional capital to matapeake  although we do not expect that matapeake will request that we fund any portion of this commitment  nor do we expect to fund any portion of this commitment  even if requested to do so 
we entered into an office lease in april for our corporate offices at avenue of the americas  new york  new york 
the term of the lease is for seven years and five months with a base rent of approximately million per year for the first four years after a five month rent free period and approximately million per year for the remainder of the term 
during october  we acquired a real property in fresno  california leased to aetna life insurance company  and agreed to fund expected improvements to the real property of approximately million 
during november  we arranged long term financing on this property and we funded a reserve account with our lender for the full amount of this obligation 
the improvements were completed in december  and substantially all of the reserve has been disbursed as of december   with the remainder expected for disbursement in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices  rate indices or other market factors 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  tenant credit ratings and equity prices 
we may attempt to mitigate certain of these risks by entering into hedge and other risk management transactions during the short term and fixed rate financings for the long term 
we seek to obtain long term fixed rate financing as soon as practicable after we make an asset investment 
there can be no assurance  however  that such mitigation strategies will be completely or even partially successful 
the level of our exposure to market risk is subject to factors beyond our control  including political risk including terrorism  monetary and tax policy  general economic conditions and a variety of other associated risks 
interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk in various aspects of our business 
the most significant ways we can be impacted by interest rates are as follows 
increases in the level of interest rates may impact our ability to add new assets  as spreads on assets we are targeting may compress unless there is a corresponding increase in asset returns and demand for our products may be adversely affected 
also  to the extent we finance assets in our portfolio on our floating rate borrowing facilities  our net income from these fixed rate assets will decrease as interest rates rise particularly libor rates and our borrowing cost increases 
our wachovia bank credit facility is currently our only floating rate borrowing facility 
in addition  as interest rates rise  our anticipated cost to finance these assets on a long term fixed rate basis may rise  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced 
we may attempt to mitigate these risks by entering into risk management transactions that react in a manner that offsets our increased interest costs and by locking our long term financing cost as soon as practicable after we commit to an asset 
as a result of market conditions  we are not currently carrying an open interest rate hedge to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for assets for which we may obtain long term financing for in the future 
our decision to do so leaves us exposed to increases in long term interest rates for those assets and  therefore  may make it more difficult or more costly to obtain long term financing 
as noted above  there can be no assurance that our mitigation strategies will be successful 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also affect the yield required on our loans and real estate securities 
changes in the required yield would result in a higher or lower value for these assets 
if the required market yields increase as a result of these interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would decline relative to us treasuries 
conversely  if the required market yields decrease as a result of interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would increase relative to us treasuries 
these changes in the market value may affect the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the losses to be other than temporary  our statement of operations through impairment losses on our loans or securities 
these value changes may also affect our ability to borrow and access capital 
credit spread curve exposure we are subject to credit spread risk in various aspects of our business 
credit spreads represent the portion of the required yield on an income investment attributable to credit quality 
credit spreads fluctuate over time as investor appetite for credit risk changes 
changes in credit spreads can have many of the same impacts on us as a change in interest rates  or principally increases in credit spreads can result in spread compression on investments we target and  thus  a slowing of our new investment pace  increases in credit spreads can increase our anticipated cost to finance assets not yet financed with long term fixed rate debt  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced  and increases in credit spreads can lower the value of our loans and securities as required yields on these assets increase 
market conditions over the past months have resulted in increases in credit spreads and generally lower fair valuations for our securities 
if these conditions continue or persist  we may be required to record impairment losses on our securities  and these losses may be significant 
tenant credit rating exposure substantially all of our portfolio assets are subject to risks due to credit rating changes of the underlying tenant or tenants 
deterioration in the underlying tenant s credit rating can result in a lower value for the related asset  which could result in a reduction in the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the loss to be other than temporary  an impairment loss on our statement of operations 
in addition  declines in the credit rating of a particular tenant prior to our obtaining long term fixed rate financing could result in a margin call by the related lender  and precipitous declines may significantly impede or eliminate our ability to finance the asset 
we manage these risks by maintaining diversity among our credits and assessing our aggregate exposure to ratings classes  in particular lower rated classes 
we also seek to lock or procure long term financing on our assets as promptly as practicable after we commit to invest 
equity price risk exposure we may seek to raise capital by sale of our common stock 
our ability to do so is dependent upon the market price of our common stock and general market conditions 
any sales we make may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
fair value for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material affect on these estimated fair values 
the fair values indicated below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environment as of december   and december   as the case may be  and may not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate or credit spread fluctuations  or changes in the ratings of the underlying tenants

we have estimated the fair value of this portfolio of loans based on sales of loans with similar credit and structural characteristics where available  and management s estimate of fair values where comparable sales information is not available 
the maturity dates for the loans range from through commercial mortgage backed securities represent subordinate interests in securitizations  as well as pass through certificates representing our pro rata investments in a pool of mortgage loans collectively  cmbs 
structuring fees receivable represent cash flows receivable by us from the sale of loans to third party purchasers 
the notional values for the cmbs are shown at their respective face amounts 
the fair values of cmbs are determined in most cases primarily by reference to index pricing 
management may also estimate fair value based on credit characteristics and term of the security  market yields on securities with similar credit ratings  and collateral values 
management has obtained broker quotes  but believes that in most cases the broker quotes reflect expected pricing for distressed trades in inactive and dislocated markets  rather than actual prices in orderly transactions 
management has ultimately determined the fair values recorded in the financial statements based on a variety of factors  and in most cases those fair values are significantly above the broker quotes 
for the cmbs  we expect to receive monthly interest coupon payments  and contractual principal payments as scheduled 
these instruments represent hedging and risk management transactions involving interest rate swaps 
they have been valued by reference to market quotations 
we had none outstanding at december  our credit facility bears interest at floating rates  and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks  the effective rates approximate market value 
accordingly  the carrying amounts outstanding are believed to approximate fair value 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage notes on real estate investments  collateralized debt obligations and the secured term loan using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our estimates of market interest rates

the maturity date of the collateralized debt obligations reflects our expected maturity date in january and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate 
we estimate the fair value of our convertible senior notes using a discounted cash flow analysis  based upon management s estimates of market interest rates  and indications of market yields  where available 
the maturity date of our convertible senior notes reflects our expected maturity date in october when the note investors have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate
