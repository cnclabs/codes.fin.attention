item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results  as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march   as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in the business section and the risk factors above  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute video game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms  including video game consoles such as the playstation  microsoft xbox and nintendo wii  personal computers  handheld game players such as the playstation portable psp and the nintendo ds and wireless devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone 
some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  madden nfl football  harry potter and fifa soccer  and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  the sims  need for speed  dead space and pogo 
our goal is to publish titles with global mass market appeal  which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non english speaking countries 
in addition  we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property 
examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sports based products eg  madden nfl football  ncaa football and fifa soccer  wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg  the sims  need for speed and battlefield and titles based on long lived literary and or movie properties eg  the godfather and harry potter 
special note regarding deferred net revenue many of our software products are developed with the ability to connect to the internet 
depending on the type of product  this feature permits consumers to play against others via the internet and or receive additional updates or content from us 
for those games that consumers can play via the internet  we may provide a matchmaking online service which permits consumers to connect with other consumers to play against each other 
in those situations where we do not separately sell this online service  we account for the sale of the software product as a bundle sale  or multiple element arrangement  in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price 
through fiscal year  for accounting purposes  vsoe existed for the online service 
accordingly  we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of the software product between the online service offered and the software product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element separately 
however  starting in fiscal year  vsoe did not exist for the online service and we began to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of these bundle sales on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period  which we estimate to be six months beginning in the month after shipment 
in addition  we also provide updates or additional content digital content for some software products to be delivered via the internet 
for some software products  at the date of sale we had an obligation to make available for download via the internet incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee 
in those transactions  we also accounted for the sale of the software product as a bundle sale and recognized the revenue on a deferred basis over the period in which we expect to make available the incremental unspecified digital content 
on a quarterly basis  the deferral amount will vary significantly depending upon the number of titles we release  the timing of their release  sales volume  returns and price protection provided for these online enabled software products 
in addition  we expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions during the period in which the product is delivered rather than on a deferred basis  which inherently creates volatility in our reported gross profit percentages 

table of contents financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was  million  up million as compared to the fiscal year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content increased by million as compared to march   directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content decreased by million as compared to march   directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march  without these changes in deferred net revenue  reported net revenue increased by approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year fiscal year net revenue was driven primarily by rock band and spore 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was  million as compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to a diluted loss per share of for the fiscal year ended march  net loss increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of the recognition of million of goodwill impairment for our ea mobile reporting unit  recognition of million related to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  of which million related to us deferred tax assets that existed as of our fiscal year ended march   a million increase in cost of goods sold  and a million increase in research and development and marketing and sales costs 
these were partially offset by an increase of million in net revenue due to increased sales of our games and a decrease of million in acquired in process technology primarily due to our acquisition of vgh in during fiscal year  we generated million of cash in operating activities as compared to generating million for fiscal year the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in external development costs  marketing and advertising costs and personnel related expenses 
trends in our business economic environment 
as a result of the national and global economic downturn  overall consumer spending has declined 
retailers globally have taken a more conservative stance in ordering game inventory 
the decrease in retail orders contributed to the decline in anticipated demand for our products during the holiday selling season 
we remain cautious about our future sales in light of the current economic environment and the impact it has had on our retailers 
current generation game consoles 
video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well 
the current cycle began with microsoft s launch of the xbox in  and continued in when sony and nintendo launched their next generation systems  the playstation and the wii  respectively 
unlike past cycles  we believe this current cycle may be extended  partly due to the growth of online services and content  and the greater graphic and processing power of the current generation hardware 
as a result  we expect the growth in the installed base of the xbox  the playstation and the wii to slow down as we enter the back half of this cycle 
therefore  in light of the current economic environment and where we stand in the current generation console cycle  our industry may experience slower growth than in recent years 
online content and services 
in addition to selling packaged goods games  we also provide a variety of electronically delivered products and services 
many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available by direct electronic download through the internet from websites that we maintain and others that we license 
we also offer electronically delivered content and services that are add ons or related to our packaged goods products eg  game enhancements or matchmaking services  and other games  content and services that are available only via electronic delivery such as games for wireless devices  and internet only games and game services 
electronically delivered content and services are offered to consumers as subscription services  electronic downloads for a one time fee  or on an advertising supported basis 
we have made 
table of contents significant investments in electronically delivered content and services  and we believe that this will become an increasingly important part of our business over time 
mobile platforms 
advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for on the go interactive entertainment that appeal to a broad consumer base 
our efforts in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two areas packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for wireless devices 
we expect sales of games for wireless devices to continue to be an important part of our business worldwide 
recent developments fiscal cost reduction plan 
in fiscal year  we announced details of a cost reduction plan 
this plan includes a narrowing of our product portfolio  a reduction in our worldwide workforce of approximately percent  or  employees  the closure of facilities  and reductions in other variable costs and capital expenditures 
we consolidated and reorganized two of our labels  the sims and ea casual entertainment into the ea play label in order to capture synergies and generate greater efficiencies between the two labels 
we now have three labels ea games  ea sports and ea play 
we believe a more focused product portfolio and a reduction in total operating expenses are better strategies for operating in the current environment 
international operations and foreign currency exchange impact 
international sales are a fundamental part of our business 
net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year and approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and  to a much lesser extent  in asia 
we believe that in order to succeed internationally  it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs 
year over year  we estimate that foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue of approximately million  or percent  for the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the us dollar strengthened against other currencies  including the euro and the british pound sterling 
in addition  our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency 
if the us dollar continues to strengthen against these currencies  then foreign exchange rates may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 
goodwill impairment 
adverse economic conditions  including the decline in our market capitalization and our expected financial performance  indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the fiscal year ended march  as a result  we performed goodwill impairment tests for our reporting units in accordance with sfas no 
 and concluded the ea mobile reporting unit s goodwill was impaired 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our ea mobile reporting unit 
substantially all of our goodwill associated with our ea mobile reporting unit was derived from our acquisition of jamdat mobile inc in february deferred income tax valuation allowance 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards 
sfas no 
additionally requires that a valuation allowance must be established against deferred tax assets when  for purposes of sfas no 
 it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making this determination  we are required under sfas no 
to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 
sfas no 
provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results  particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the economic environment 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
in making our assessment  we are also required to consider the scheduled reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  carry back of future deductible amounts allowed under current tax law  and tax planning strategies 
based on these requirements  we 
table of contents have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets  consisting of million related to deferred tax assets that existed as of our fiscal year ended march   plus an additional million against deferred tax assets recorded during fiscal year in addition  we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggests that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns  allowances and bad debt reserves we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and wii  pcs  handheld game players such as the psp and nintendo ds  and wireless devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone 
we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met evidence of an arrangement 
evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products that must be present in order to recognize revenue 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
for online game services  delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided 
for digital downloads that do not have an online service component  delivery is considered to occur generally when the download is made available 
fixed or determinable fee 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable generally upon cash collection 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes to any of these assumptions or management judgments  or changes to the elements in a software arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
for example  in connection with some of our packaged goods product sales  we offer an online service without an additional fee 
prior to fiscal year  we were able to determine vsoe for the online service to be delivered  therefore  we were able to allocate the total price received from the combined product and online service sale between these two elements and recognize the related revenue separately 
however  starting in fiscal 
table of contents year  vsoe no longer existed for the online service to be delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these transactions is recognized over the estimated online service period 
more specifically  starting in fiscal year  we began to recognize the revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods on a straight line basis over a six month period beginning in the month after shipment 
accordingly  this relatively small change from having vsoe for the online service to no longer having vsoe has had a significant effect on our reported results 
in addition  for some software products we also provide updates or additional content digital content to be delivered via the internet that can be used with the original software product 
in many cases we separately sell digital content for an additional fee  however some purchased digital content can only be accessed via the internet ie  the consumer never takes possession of the digital content 
we account for online transactions in which the consumer does not take possession of the digital content as a service transaction and  accordingly  we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated service period 
in other transactions  at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee 
in these cases  we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the game 
determining whether a transaction constitutes an online service transaction or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult 
the accounting for these transactions is significantly different 
revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 
revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered 
if the service period is not defined  we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period 
determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 
in addition  determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult 
product revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors channel partners  is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns  price protection  and other offerings  which may occur with our customers and channel partners 
price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product 
the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price 
in certain countries  we have stock balancing programs for our pc and video game system software products  which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances 
it is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 
in certain countries  from time to time  we decide to provide price protection for our software products 
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products  current trends in retail and the video game segment  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products  and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing software products 
for example  the risk of product returns and or price protection for our software products may continue to increase as the playstation console moves through its lifecycle 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates changed  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported total net revenue 
in addition  if our estimates of returns and price protection related to online enabled packaged goods software products change  the amount of net deferred revenue we recognize in the future would change 

table of contents significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion on the appropriate accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets and acquired in process technology  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective  and  if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities assumed and acquired in process technology in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives and acquired in process technology is expensed upon consummation 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  an asset that is not amortized 
determining the fair value of acquired assets requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset and the related expected future cash flows 
determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to extinguish the liability and determining the fair value of acquired in process technology requires an assessment of our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in process technology 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 
assessment of impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
for some assets  our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful 
this success is dependent upon several factors  which are beyond our control  such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 

table of contents sfas no 
requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
sfas no 
requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
to determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step  we use a combination of the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data  and or the income approach  or discounted cash flows 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of developing  marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of accuracy 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
assessment of impairment of short term investments  marketable equity securities and other investments 
we periodically review our short term investments  marketable equity securities and other investments for impairment 
our short term investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies  both are accounted for as available for sale under the provisions of sfas no  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as amended 
unrealized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are recorded to other comprehensive income  net of tax  until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in the fair value of a security to a level below its cost basis is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security 
the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the duration that the fair value has been less than the cost basis  severity of the impairment  reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
during the fiscal year ended march  and  we recognized impairment charges of million and million  respectively  on our marketable equity securities 
we did not recognize any impairment charges on our marketable equity securities during the fiscal year ended march  our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
our other investments consist principally of non voting preferred shares in two companies whose common stock is publicly traded and are accounted for under the cost method as prescribed by accounting principles board apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  as amended 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in the carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required  based primarily on the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we recognized impairment charges of million and million  respectively  on our other investments 
we did not recognize any impairment charges during the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents assessment of inventory obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel 
we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value  based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 
at the point of a loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan is determined using the black scholes valuation model which requires us to make certain assumptions about the future 
determining the estimated fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the black scholes valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use a combination of historical stock price volatility and implied volatility computed based on the price of options publicly traded on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate  which is based on historical data  as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers  and co publishing and distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks  copyrights  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of product 
royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue 
significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract 
because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue  it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors  including the total number of titles subject to the contract  the timing of the release of these titles  the number of software units we expect to sell  which can be impacted by a number of variables  including product quality  the timing of the title s release and competition  and future pricing 
determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products 
accordingly  if our future revenue projections change  our effective royalty rates would change  which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 

table of contents prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and  therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor 
when performance remains with the licensor  we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 
these obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months 
as of march  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 
each quarter  we also evaluate the future realization of our royalty based assets  as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments or losses determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold 
we evaluate long lived royalty based assets for impairment based on the provisions of sfas no 
ie  on an undiscounted cash flow basis when impairment indicators exist 
unrecognized minimum royalty based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and  therefore  any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
during fiscal years and  we recognized loss charges of million and loss and impairment charges of million  respectively  related to our royalty agreements 
we had no loss or impairment charges during fiscal year income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards 
sfas no 
additionally requires that a valuation allowance must be established against deferred tax assets when  for purposes of sfas no 
 it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making this determination  we are required under sfas no 
to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 
sfas no 
provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results  particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the economic environment 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income  we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets  namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments 
each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence  and involve assumptions about future activity 
sfas no 
provides that certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 
for example  when determining the valuation allowance we recorded in the fiscal year ended march   we did not include as a source of future taxable income the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in redwood city  california 
these facilities are subject to leases which expire in july  and are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
if we are unable or decide not to renew these leases and instead acquire the facilities  then we would be able to include a significant portion of the 
table of contents temporary differences representing approximately million of deferred tax liabilities as a source of future taxable income  and we would record a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance 
based on the assumptions and requirements noted above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets  consisting of million related to deferred tax assets that existed as of our fiscal year ended march   plus an additional million against deferred tax assets recorded during fiscal year in addition  we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggests that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate

in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
fsp fas provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased  and includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
fsp fas is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and should be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact fsp fas will have on our consolidated financial statements

for fiscal year  we generated million of cash proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments and million in proceeds from sales of common stock through our stock based compensation plans 
our primary use of cash in non operating activities consisted of million used to purchase short term investments  million in capital expenditures and million used for acquisitions 
short term investments and marketable equity securities due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities  our short term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short term interest rates 
as of march   our short term investments had gross unrealized gains of million  or percent of the total in short term investments  and gross unrealized losses of less than million  or less than percent of the total in short term investments 
from time to time  we may liquidate some or all of our short term investments to fund operational needs or other activities  such as capital expenditures  business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs 
depending on which short term investments we liquidate to fund these activities  we could recognize a portion  or all  of the gross unrealized gains or losses 
marketable equity securities decreased to million as of march   from million as of march  this decrease was due to a million reduction in our unrealized gains and impairment charges of million and million recognized on our neowiz and the common stock investments  respectively

accounts payable accounts payable decreased to million as of march   from million as of march   primarily due to the timing of payments related to our inventory purchases 
accrued and other current liabilities our accrued and other current liabilities decreased to million as of march  from million as of march  the million decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in accrued incentive based compensation and a million decrease in accrued contingent liabilities related to certain of our acquisitions 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in our deferred net revenue other and a million increase in royalties payable directly associated with the increase in our co publishing and distribution revenue and inventory 
deferred income taxes  net our net deferred income tax asset position decreased by million as of march  as compared to march  primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance 
financial condition we believe that cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable equity securities  cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and  potentially  future acquisitions or strategic investments

inflation we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and market prices  which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks 
foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below 
while we do not hedge our short term investment portfolio  we protect our short term investment portfolio against different market risks  including interest rate risk as discussed below 
our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consist of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk cash flow hedging activities 
from time to time  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses  as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded 
the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value  if any  is reported in each period in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
our hedging programs are designed to reduce  but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and research and development expenses 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march   these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of million  included in other current assets 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march   these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of million  included in other current assets 
balance sheet hedging activities 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and 
table of contents payables 
the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near month end 
our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income  net 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  which are also reported in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in certain cases  the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated asset or liability  in which case our results will be impacted 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling 
as of march   we had forward foreign currency contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling 
the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march  and the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material  the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business 
a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure credit worthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential losses in fair value of our option contracts used in cash flow hedging of million in both scenarios 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential losses on our forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of million and million  respectively  as of march  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
however  because short term investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of short term investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments 
additionally  the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading 
also  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 

table of contents as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale and  consequently  recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of any tax effects  in stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  us treasury securities corporate bonds us agency securities commercial paper asset backed securities total short term investments notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio

the fair value of our marketable equity securities was million and million as of march  and march   respectively 
in fiscal years and  we recognized other than temporary impairment losses on our marketable equity securities of million and million  respectively 
our marketable equity securities have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by volatility in the public stock markets
