item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview epicor software corporation epicor or the company designs  develops  markets and supports enterprise application software solutions and services primarily for use by midsized companies and the divisions and subsidiaries of global enterprises  which generally consist of companies with annual revenues between million and billion  and emerging enterprises  which generally consist of rapidly growing businesses with annual revenues under million 
epicor s solutions are designed to help companies focus on their customers  suppliers  partners  and employees through enterprise wide management of resources and information 
this collaborative focus distinguishes the company from conventional enterprise resource planning erp vendors  whose primary focus is improving internal business processes and efficiencies 
the company believes that by automating and integrating information and critical business processes across their entire value chain  enterprises can improve not just their bottom line  but also their top line  allowing them to compete more effectively in today s increasingly global economy 
the financial market crisis has continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide and has led to continued weakening in the global economic environment 
the effect of the continued weakening of the global economy and the fallout from the financial market crisis is expected to continue to challenge epicor s ability to sell software licenses and may negatively impact demand for our consulting services 
the adverse economic environment has also increased the difficulty of forecasting revenues  as a decrease in license revenue may lead to a decrease in consulting revenue in the same or subsequent quarters 
lower license revenue may also decrease maintenance revenue since maintenance fees for new product licenses are directly related to software license sales 
in response to this difficult economic environment  epicor took steps in november to reduce our headcount and lower expenses 
the company continues to monitor the economic situation  the business environment and the company s outlook 
total revenues for the year ended december   increased to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this included total revenue from the nsb acquisition of million  of which million was related to hardware and other

cash flows were relatively flat despite significantly lower net income for the year ended december   compared to this is due to an increase in amortization and increase in restructuring charges in the current year  an approximate million noncash tax benefit in the prior year  offset with additional cash provided by working capital accounts in the current year 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states of america generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as such  management is required to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies which are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following 
table of contents revenue recognition the company enters into contractual arrangements with end users that may include licensing of the company s software products  product support and maintenance services  consulting services  resale of third party hardware or various combinations thereof  including the sale of such products or services separately 
the company s accounting policies regarding the recognition of revenue for these contractual arrangements is fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers many factors when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america related to revenue recognition 
these factors include  but are not limited to the actual contractual terms  such as payment terms  delivery dates and pricing of the various product and service elements of a contract  availability of products to be delivered  time period over which services are to be performed  creditworthiness of the customer  the complexity of customizations and integrations to the company s software required by service contracts  the sales channel through which the sale is made direct  var  distributor  etc  discounts given for each element of a contract  any commitments made as to installation or implementation go live dates and whether vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists 
each of the relevant factors is analyzed to determine its impact  individually and collectively with other factors  on the revenue to be recognized for any particular contract with a customer 
management is required to make judgments regarding the significance of each factor in applying the revenue recognition standards  as well as whether or not each factor complies with such standards 
any misjudgment or error by management in its evaluation of the factors and the application of the standards  especially with respect to complex or new types of transactions  could have a material adverse affect on the company s future revenues and operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable go through a collection process that is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with customers at specified intervals and assistance from other personnel within the company who have a relationship with the customer 
the company writes off accounts to its allowance when the company has determined that collection is not likely 
the company believes no significant concentrations of credit risk existed at december  receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections performance and specific collection issues 
if actual bad debts differ from the reserves calculated  the company records an adjustment to bad debt expense in the period in which the difference occurs 
such adjustment could result in additional charges to the company s results of operations 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets were recorded as a result of the company s acquisitions and represent acquired technology  customer base and trademarks 
these intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic life of the asset 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the intangible assets and considers any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
any material changes in circumstances  such as large decreases in revenue or the discontinuation of a particular product line  could require future write downs in the company s intangibles assets and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur 
goodwill the company s goodwill was recorded as a result of the company s acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the company has recorded these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company annually performs an impairment review of its recorded goodwill  and in determined that no impairment of goodwill existed because the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
the company tests 
table of contents its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist  by determining if the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
factors that could trigger an impairment include  but are not limited to  underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
future impairment reviews may require write downs in the company s goodwill and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur 
during the fourth quarter of  the closing price of the company s common stock was significantly impacted by the volatility in the us equity markets 
the price of the company s common stock reached a low of during the fourth quarter  a condition that was not sustained for an extended period of time 
these lows for the company s common stock coincided with the stock markets week lows recorded as the financial crisis intensified 
during most of the fourth quarter  the company s common stock traded above per share and closed the fiscal quarter at per share on december  our market capitalization as of december  was million and exceeded the carrying value of our consolidated net assets of million by million 
we believe that the fair value of our company exceeds our market capitalization because our fair value should include a control premium 
a control premium is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
the premium is justified by the expected synergies  such as the expected increase in cash flow resulting from cost savings and revenue enhancements 
although our market capitalization exceeded the carrying value of our consolidated net assets by million as of december  before considering a control premium  the company completed a formal interim step impairment test  which again showed no impairment 
however  due to the ongoing uncertainty in market conditions  which may continue to negatively impact our market capitalization and cash flows  we will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  volatility  terms and estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from the estimate  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
beginning in  the company changed its previous practice of predominantly granting stock options to employees  and began granting primarily restricted stock as an alternative 
compensation expense for restricted stock is based on the fair market value of the restricted stock on its grant date  and is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
income taxes income taxes are determined under guidelines prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability and has established a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment  the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
during the year ended december   the company determined  primarily based on operating income during recent years and anticipated operating income and cash flows for future periods  that it is more likely than not that 
table of contents certain foreign deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and accordingly  it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
as a result  the company released a portion of the valuation allowance related to certain foreign jurisdictions  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit to net income  as well as a credit to goodwill as some of the deferred tax assets existed at the date of scala s acquisition 
the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance for the remaining foreign deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
the remaining valuation allowance will continue to be evaluated over future quarters 
future releases of the valuation allowance related to the scala acquisition will be accounted for as a reduction in income tax expense pursuant to sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas no 
r 
effective january   sfas r provides that any reduction to the valuation allowance established in purchase accounting is to be accounted for as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective january   the company adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although the company believes it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are supportable  the company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
the company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made

the company believes that its existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity position 
foreign currency risk the company has several operations in foreign locations around the world 
these operations incur revenue and expenses in various foreign currencies 
revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar expose the company to foreign currency market risk 
unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other foreign currencies may have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
these foreign currency market movements could create a foreign currency gain or loss that could be realized or unrealized for the company 
the company s board of directors has approved a foreign 
table of contents currency risk policy that allows the company to enter into forward contracts and purchase option agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 
the company has an ongoing program to evaluate its foreign currency risk and to minimize these risks whenever possible through leading and lagging accounts payables and accounts receivables  centralized cash management and other forms of natural hedging

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
based on the investment interest rate and the balance as of december   a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis  as well as decrease the company s net income and decrease cash flows from operations 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
deposits with its us issuers may exceed the amounts of federal deposit insurance provided on such deposits  and deposits held outside the us are not afforded such protection 
the company has approximately of its cash and cash equivalents outside the us the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company has not experienced any losses on deposits of cash or cash equivalents 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above 
changes in interest rates do not affect the amount of interest we pay on our fixed rate senior convertible notes  but do affect the fair value of the debt 
interest under the company s credit facility is computed on a floating rate basis 
the credit facility requires the company to enter into interest rate swap agreements to protect against fluctuations in the floating rate for up to of the outstanding balance of the term loan for a period of time 
on april   the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements that convert a portion of its floating rate interest rate exposure under the credit facility to a fixed rate basis 
the interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps will be reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swap on the balance sheet 
the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap agreements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as interest rates change 
at december   the interest rates swap arrangements hedged the floating rate interest risk on million of the million term loan balance then outstanding under the credit facility 
accordingly  at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  as well as decrease the company s net income and decrease cash flows from operations 
foreign currency risk 
the company did not have any foreign currency forward or option contracts open as of december  international revenues represented of the company s total revenues for the year ended december   and of revenues were denominated in foreign currencies 
the company had an unrealized and realized transactional foreign currency loss for the year ended december  of million 
for the year ended december   the transactional loss was primarily due to settlement of inter company balances  changes in value of certain cash and other net assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies and a decline in value of foreign currency option contracts associated with the company s acquisition of nsb 
given a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the exchange rate between the us dollar and other major currencies  the unrealized or realized transaction gain or loss would increase or decrease by approximately usd million for the year ended december   and likewise increase or decrease the company s earnings and cash flows for the respective periods
