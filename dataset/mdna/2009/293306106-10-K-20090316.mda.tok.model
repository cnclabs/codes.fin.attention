item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
note to the financial statements contains segment information 
overview results of operations the engineering segment provides consulting services relating to the development  management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project services 
services provided by the engineering segment include feasibility studies  engineering  design  procurement  and construction management 
the construction segment provides construction management personnel and services in the areas of inspection  mechanical integrity  vendor and turnaround surveillance  field support  construction  quality assurance and plant asset management 
the automation segment provides services related to the design  fabrication  and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems  advanced automation  information technology  and process piping heat tracing projects 
the land segment provides land management  right of way  and governmental regulatory compliance services primarily to pipeline  utility and telecom companies and other owner operators of infrastructure facilities throughout the united states and canada 
the company s revenue is composed of engineering  procurement and construction service revenue and engineered systems sales 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company s engineering services have historically been provided through cost plus contracts whereas a majority of the company s engineered system sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide engineering  materials  and equipment and may provide construction services on a direct hire or subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued all costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment s operation 
corporate sg a expense is comprised primarily of marketing costs  as well as costs related to executive  governance investor relations  finance  accounting  safety  human resources  project controls and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific client projects 
corporate sg a expense may vary as costs are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overall comparisons revenue overall revenue increased  or million  from million in to million in and increased  or million  from million in only of our growth in was a result of the incremental revenue contribution from acquisitions 
we had increases in revenue in of million due to additional work created by hurricane ike and million from a refinery rebuild project 
both of these projects included large amounts of material and subcontractor purchases and are expected to be completed by the first quarter of revenue also grew due to an overall higher level of project activity in the markets we serve 
in particular we benefited from the increased capital spending in the pipeline area which increased revenue in our construction  engineering and land segments 
approximately of our revenue growth from to was external growth as a result of the incremental revenue contribution from acquisitions 
the balance of the revenue growth from to occurred as a result of internal measures and a higher level of project activity in the market we serve 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in and increased million  or  from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased by from in to in but increased in from in the major factor that contributed to lower gross profit margins in relative to was an increase of million in revenues related to low margin pass through procurement and subcontracted construction revenue 
the remaining decline was due to increased work on lower margin services such as pipeline inspection 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses overall sg a expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in in  overall sg a expense increased million  or  from million in as a percentage of revenue  sg a decreased from in to in and decreased from in the main savings occurred in bad debt expense and amortization 
in  the bad debt expense was elevated due to the creation of the reserve on the notes receivable for the sle project and amortization was increased by  due to the goodwill impairment in the automation segment 
even though we did not have the significant increase in bad debt due to the sle project in  we did have increased amounts of general bad debt expense due to the economic instability that has caused some customers to file bankruptcy or to otherwise be unable to pay 
details relating to the changes in each segment are discussed further below 
corporate sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase primarily relates to salaries and employee related expenses  which increased million 
there was also an increase of million in facilities expense  million in professional services for items such as sarbanes oxley sox compliance and professional consulting services and an increase in amortization and depreciation expense of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of million 
as a percentage of revenue  corporate sg a decreased from in to in corporate sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase relates primarily to salaries and employee related expenses  which increased million 
of these expenses  million relates to the management incentive plan 
since the company experienced losses in  we incurred no management incentive plan expense during that year 
the remainder is attributable to a general increase in corporate overhead positions to support company growth 
there was also an increase in professional services for items such as sarbanes oxley sox compliance and audits totaling million and an increase of amortization and depreciation expense of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of million

operating profit increased million to million in as compared to million in  increasing  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in this increase was primarily the result of the company s loss in on two fixed price contracts that did not recur in however  operating profit in was reduced by a million charge taken in relation to the sle project  discussed in further detail in item other income expense other income decreased from  in to  in other income was  in other income in was derived mainly from gains on the sale of fixed assets with the majority being from the sale of land in beaumont which resulted in a gain of  other income in was derived from a gain of  from the sale of our building in baton rouge offset by a loss of  on the sale of assets from the closing of our dallas office

refining related activity in was particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates  expand existing facilities and utilize heavier sour crude 
capital spending in the pipeline area also trended higher  with numerous projects in north america currently underway to deliver crude oil  natural gas  petrochemicals and refined products 
renewable energy appears to be an emerging area of activity and potential growth  with the company currently performing a variety of services primarily on biomass related facilities 
the engineering segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
our detail design services proved strong with revenues increasing  or million  from million in to million in this increase was mainly due to a refinery rebuild project 
in  these services increased  or million  from million in as a percent of total engineering revenue  detail design revenue increased to in from in and increased in from in our field services revenues decreased  or million  from million in to million in due to a general decrease in demand from our existing customers for in plant resources

the decrease in was due to the completion of the two epc projects 
as a percent of total engineering revenue  procurement services revenue increased to in from in and decreased in from in the level of procurement services varies over time depending on the volume of procurement activity our customers choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services 
fixed price revenues decreased  or million  from million in to million in there was a decrease in of  or million  from million in as a percent of total engineering revenue  fixed price revenue decreased to in from in  and in it decreased from in this decrease was the result of the company s decision to be very selective in the fixed price contracts it undertakes due to the risk of loss if the contract costs are not estimated accurately 
gross profit our engineering segment s total gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of total gross profit  the engineering segment s gross profit decreased from to during the same period 
the decrease in total gross profit percentages was due to the increase in low margin procurement services revenue from million to million 
total gross profit in increased million  or  from million in due to the completion of the two epc loss projects 
in  the company shifted a portion of its services to developer type work for customers that are typically smaller than its historical customer base  including sle 
the viability of these projects and the creditworthiness of these types of customers must be carefully analyzed to assure profitable results 
in the future  the company intends to analyze these projects on a more comprehensive basis before accepting them 
however  the company believes that some of its customers may begin to require contracts on a fixed price basis 
the company has also engaged in a number of entrepreneurial ventures over the past several years  not all of which have been profitable 
in the future  the company intends to scrutinize these projects much more carefully before engaging in them and exit them more quickly if they are not successful 
during  one of those ventures was discontinued in march with the closing of our dallas office as the location did not provide the intended benefits 
we earn a lower margin on procurement services than we earn on our core engineering services 
for example  procurement services for produced a gross profit margin  whereas core engineering services produced a gross profit margin of 
if the company s business shifts away from predominantly engineering projects to epc projects which include material procurement and construction responsibility  engineering gross profit as a percentage of revenue will be negatively impacted 
this shift would precipitate lower gross profit because higher cost plus margins on engineering labor  recognized during the period in which it was earned  would be combined with the lower margins on procurement services and construction subcontractor charges and recorded throughout the duration of the projects 
in addition  if our business shifts more to fixed price work  our risk assessment and project management tools will be critical to our continued successful operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the engineering segment s sg a expenses increased million in over as a result of increases for bad debt expense 
of this increase  million was related to creation of the reserve against the sle notes receivable  while the remainder comprised general increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
to offset these increases  facilities and office expenses decreased by million due to the closing of the dallas office in march also  salaries and employee expenses decreased by million as a result of the reclassification of some employees from overhead to direct expense positions 
additional savings were recognized as a result of the reduction in stock compensation expense and professional services 
operating profit operating profit increased million to million in as compared to million in  which increased million from million in as a percentage of total revenue  operating profit remained relatively stable at in compared to in  but increased significantly from in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued construction segment twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands gross revenue    less intercompany revenue   total revenue pipeline    non pipeline total revenue    gross profit    operating sg a expense    operating income    revenue the construction segment contributed of our total revenue for  as its revenue increased million  or  from million in to million in the revenue in for this segment increased  or million  from million in the construction segment s estimated backlog at december  was million but the backlog and previously anticipated growth expected for pipeline and osha plant inspections  as well as plant turnaround and construction management support projects and high tech maintenance services  may be negatively impacted by current economic conditions 
non pipeline revenue  as a percent of the segment s total revenue  continued to decline from in  to in and during our non pipeline revenue growth increased year over year from million in to million in increased capital spending in the pipeline area in  particularly in inspection services  contributed of the segment s total revenue in as pipeline revenue has grown year over year from to and again from to the revenue from this segment comes entirely from field services that are not typically limited to one project 
the company s past experience with this activity is that the term of these assignments on average spans multiple projects and multiple years 
gross profit the construction segment s gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in in  this segment s gross profit increased million  or  from million in as a percent of revenue  gross profit decreased by  from in to in  but it increased in from in the percentage of gross profit has decreased while revenue has been increasing significantly due to the changing mix of work being performed in this segment 
the main increase in work has been in pipeline related revenues which typically carry lower margins than our non pipeline related revenues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the construction segment s sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in in  sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased from in to in  and decreased in from in the construction segment s sg a expenses increased million in over mainly due to increases in salaries and related employee expenses of  amortization and depreciation expense of  and allowances for bad debt of  these increases were offset by savings of  in professional services and  in facilities expense 
the construction segment s sg a expenses increased million in over mainly due to increases in salaries and related employee expenses of  overhead positions were added to accommodate the internal and acquisition related growth of this segment 
additionally  facilities expense increased  as a result of additional office space leased to house acquired operations

this project is expected to end during the first quarter of the company began to focus more on automation services beginning in and began marketing them more aggressively at that time 
refining related activity has been particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates 
this  together with the acquisition of analyzer technology international  inc ati in january  has increased the client demand for turn key  analytical solutions 
another factor positively affecting the automation business is that the computer based distributed control systems equipment used for facility plant automation becomes technologically obsolete over time  supporting ongoing replacement 
in  this segment expanded its customer base and geographic reach to include specialty chemicals and pulp and paper markets with the acquisition of advanced control engineering  llc in september 
the automation segment s estimated backlog at december  was million  but the backlog could be negatively impacted by the current and possible future economic downturn 
gross profit the automation segment s gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in in  it decreased million  or  from million in also  as a percent of revenue  gross profit increased by from in to in  but it decreased in from in during  the automation segment expanded into several new regions  resulting in higher increased costs in relation to revenues 
also during  an unanticipated shortage of available experienced labor caused an increase in labor hourly rates of approximately 
during that same period  most material costs unexpectedly increased by approximately to  and the price of copper wire increased 
these increases in labor and material costs adversely affected project margins on fixed price projects in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the automation segment s sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in in  sg a expenses decreased million  or  from million in as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased from in to in  and it decreased in from in the automation segment s sg a expenses increased  in over  mainly due to increases in allowances for bad debt of  facilities expense of  and stock compensation expense of  these increases were offset by savings in amortization and depreciation expense of  due to the goodwill impairment of  that was taken in in   of amortization was recorded in connection with the intangible assets created from the acquisition of advance control engineering  llc 
additional savings of  was recognized in professional services 
this segment s sg a expenses decreased  in over  mainly due to decreases in salaries and related employee expenses of  salaries and expenses for business development personnel were moved to corporate overhead in july to be consistent with the reporting of these costs throughout the company 
the reduction of overhead personnel and the transfer of automation segment overhead personnel expense to direct expense also contributed to this decrease 
we also recognized professional services savings of  and  less in bad debt expense in compared to offsetting these savings  amortization costs increased by  of these additional costs   was goodwill impairment

therefore  financial information only includes seven months of activity 
this acquisition has given englobal additional cross selling capabilities and allows us to offer our clients a turkey solution for a pipeline project  with the additional capability of right of way acquisition through the land group 
a general increase in capital spending by our clients has contributed to this increase in land segment revenue 
we have also been able to increase our client base 
the land segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
however  the backlog may be negatively impacted by current and possible future economic downturn 
gross profit gross profit for our land segment increased million  or  from million in to million in in  it increased million  or  from million in this increase in gross profit is attributed to the ability to renegotiate our existing contracts to cover our increased costs

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in is primarily due to the extended months reported for however  in reviewing sg a as a percentage of revenue  there were decreases of in facilities  in marketing  and in salaries and related employee expenses 
in  the houston operations of the former wrc corporation moved into the existing englobal facilities and the engineering segment took over some of the former wrc corporation s facilities in denver 
operating profit the land segment s operating profit increased by million from million in to million in operating profit in increased million from million in as a percentage of total revenue  operating profit increased to in from in  and increased in from in liquidity and capital resources overview the company defines liquidity as its ability to pay liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations 
our primary source of liquidity during the year ended december  was borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility with comerica bank  discussed under senior revolving credit facility below the comerica credit facility 
cash on hand at december  totaled million and availability under the comerica credit facility totaled million resulting in total liquidity of million 
we believe that we have sufficient available cash required for operations for the next months 
however  cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if i revenues decline as a result of the decline in the price of oil or other economic factors  ii amounts billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner  iii circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices  iv project mix shifts from cost reimbursable to fixed price contracts during significant periods of growth  v the company loses one or more of its major customers  vi the company experiences cost overruns on fixed price contracts  vii our client mix shifts from our historical owner operator client base to more developer based clients  viii future acquisitions are not integrated timely  or ix we are not able to meet the covenants of the comerica credit facility 
if any such event occurs  we would be forced to consider alternative financing options 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million in net cash in but required the use of million and million in net cash in each of and respectively 
for the year ended december   cash generated from operations was offset by the increase in working capital primarily due to increased trade receivables of million  increased accounts payable of million  and increased accrued compensation and benefits of million 
the increase in trade receivables was primarily due to amounts billed but not collected in a timely manner in our engineering segment and circumstances preventing the timely internal processing of invoices in our automation segment 
the increase in accounts payable primarily related to vendor sub contractor payments of approximately million related to projects in both our engineering and automation segments 
the increase in accrued compensation and benefits was primarily related to year over year timing differences of pay period ending dates during the month of december 
in  the note receivable re classification on the sle project was related to the client s obligation in the principal amount of million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash flows from operating activities were significantly lower in than in and primarily due to the million in operating losses recorded during on two fixed price epc contracts 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to million in and million in in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the investment made to acquire ace 
in  our investing activities consisted of capital additions of million primarily for computers and technical software applications 
the investing activity in  which was significantly higher than in and  was primarily a result of the investments made in acquiring wrc corporation and certain assets of both ati and watco 
future investing activities are anticipated to remain consistent with prior years and include capital additions for leasehold improvements  technical applications software  and equipment  such as upgrades to computers 
the comerica credit facility  discussed under senior revolving credit facility below  limits annual capital expenditures to million 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used cash totaling million in  but provided cash totaling million and million in and  respectively 
our primary financing mechanism is our line of credit under the comerica credit facility 
the line of credit has been used principally to finance working capital requirements 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
cash flow from financing activity in  which was significantly higher than in and  was primarily a result of borrowings related to our acquisitions of wrc corporation  ati  and watco plus the losses related to the two fixed price contracts 
we anticipate that future cash flows from financing activities will be borrowings  payments on the line of credit and payments on long term debt instruments 
line of credit fluctuations are a function of timing related to operations  obligations and payments received on accounts receivable 
we estimate that payments on long term debt  including interest for the coming year  will be million 
senior revolving credit facility historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
during august  the company entered into a new credit agreement with comerica bank  which provides a three year  million senior secured revolving credit facility comerica credit facility 
the comerica credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of company s subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  and positions comerica as senior to all other debt 
it replaced a million senior revolving credit facility that would have expired in july the outstanding balance on the comerica credit facility as of december  was million 
the remaining borrowings available under the comerica credit facility as of december  were million after consideration of loan covenant restrictions 
at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the comerica credit facility will bear interest at a eurodollar based rate plus an additional margin based on the leverage ratio or at the prime based rate 
the additional margin ranges from basis points to basis points on the libor based loans 
upon maturity  the libor debt will automatically roll into the revolver unless the company elects to renew  at which time a new maturity date and interest rate will be set 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the comerica credit facility requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants as of the end of each calendar month  including the following o leverage ratio not to exceed to  o asset coverage ratio less than to  and o net worth greater than the sum of million plus of positive net income earned in each fiscal quarter after january  plus of the net proceeds of any offering  sale or other transfer of any capital stock or any equity securities 
the comerica credit facility also contains covenants that place certain limitations on the company including limits on new debt  mergers  asset sales  investments  fixed price contracts  and restrictions on certain distributions 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the comerica credit facility as of december  due to significant losses incurred on two fixed price projects during the third and fourth quarters of  the company requested and was successful in obtaining a waiver and subsequent amendment to the comerica credit facility in order to meet the monthly fixed charge ratio 
if we had not been able to obtain a waiver or amendment of the covenant  we may have been unable to make further borrowings and may have been required to repay all loans then outstanding under the comerica credit facility 
letters of credit as of december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling  primarily to cover self insured deductibles under both our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
long term debt our total long term debt outstanding on december  was million see note to consolidated financial statements  a decrease from million as of december  as of december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling  primarily to cover self insured deductibles under both our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period and thereafter total in thousands long term debt    capital lease contractual interest and discount on certain notes    subtotal long term debt    insurance note payable   operating leases       total contractual cash obligations      future interest consists primarily of interest on the line of credit under the comerica credit facility

interest and discount rates on the remainder of the company s notes payable vary from to  with the weighted average being at december  del 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued non cash transactions in  non cash transactions included million discounted notes payable issued in connection with the acquisition of ace 
in  non cash transactions included a million note receivable issued upon the sale of a building the company owned in baton rouge  louisiana and a note receivable in the principal amount of million issued to south louisiana ethanol sle and evidenced by a hand note 
to see details of the hand note  see exhibits  and filed with the k

also in  million of stock was issued associated with the acquisition of wrc corporation 
we also acquired insurance with notes payable of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
derivative financial instruments we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
long term note receivable in the first quarter of  englobal engineering  inc eei and south louisiana ethanol  llc sle executed an agreement for epc services relating to the retro fit of an ethanol plant in southern louisiana 
the history of the sle project the project is described in note to the company s financial statements included in its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  after funding certain initial stages of the project with cash  sle obtained temporary financing from its bridge lending bank in the amount of million until it could obtain permanent financing for the project 
the parties anticipated that permanent financing would be obtained from other lenders no later than august  sle had engaged a major commercial bank to assist with finding permanent financing 
further  sle informed eei that this commercial bank had obtained permanent financing for numerous other ethanol facilities 
based on this  as well as on conversations between the company s chief executive officer and representatives of this commercial bank  eei expected the financing for the project to be consummated on a timely basis 
given this expectation  together with the favorable prices for corn and for ethanol  and the robust credit markets  eei believed that the project would be successful and commenced work in the fourth quarter of in the late summer of  although sle was current in its payments it had not obtained permanent financing  corn prices began to increase and ethanol prices began to decline 
accordingly the company decided that it was advisable to obtain security for the amount due 
on august   sle executed a collateral mortgage  a collateral note  and a promissory note in the amount of up to million  securing payment of the amount due  and the company re classed the amounts receivable from sle to a note receivable 
in connection with this promissory note  and as provided for under louisiana law  sle executed another promissory note the hand note on or about october  the hand note had a principal balance of approximately million  constituting all amounts then due 
sle was current on all invoices through september  however  on september   sle requested that eei immediately demobilize its activity and instruct its subcontractors to do the same 
eei complied with this request 
because collectability was not assured  the company reserved the amounts which were in excess of the hand note 
although work has not recommenced on the project and sle has not obtained permanent financing  the company continues to believe that  due to the value of the collateral and the company s lien position  the note receivable is fully item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued collectible 
specifically  an updated appraisal from the bridge lending bank s appraiser indicates a fair market value of million  an orderly liquidation value of million  and a forced liquidation value of million 
the company believes that if the collateral is liquidated  sle s obligations to the company would be paid in full pursuant to the collateral mortgage in favor of the company 
however  collectability is not assured at this time 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a valuation reserve and subsequent charge against bad debt expense in the amount of million to reduce the book value of the note receivable 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased the valuation reserve and subsequent charge against bad debt expense in the amount of  as of december   the company performed its impairment analysis for the asset group classified as long term notes receivable  particularly notes receivable south louisiana ethanol  of million 
due to the ongoing discovery and analysis currently in process on our sle litigation we cannot yet determine the actual proceeds that would be generated for englobal when the courts determine the status of each asset and the relative lien priorities of sle s creditors  and then such assets are sold 
however  at this time management believes that  given the company s lien position as documented in public records  the value of the collateral will cover the current balance sheet exposure 
any additional charge  or negative determination by the courts  could have a negative impact on future earnings estimated at cents per share per million of un recovered exposure as a result of a non cash charge to operations 
however  at this time the company believes that the ultimate disposition of the sle collateral will not materially adversely affect our liquidity or overall financial position 
the company will continue to evaluate the sle situation and  if required in the future  make adjustments to the reserve as necessary to remain in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
contingent liabilities and commitments to our knowledge  the company is not exposed to any environmental liability 
the company does not have any product liability issues 
lease commitments are included in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
the company leases all of its office space 
there are no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
income tax provision on july   the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and related implementation issues  which provides guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return

this interpretation also revises the disclosure requirements and was adopted by the company effective as of january  there are currently no material tax positions identified as uncertain for the company or its subsidiaries 
we recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in governmental penalties 
as of december   we have not recognized interest or penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions 
the company is subject to federal and state income tax audits from time to time that could result in proposed assessments 
the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of such audits  how these audits would be resolved and whether the company would be required to make additional tax payments  which may or may not include penalties and interest 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company does not have any examination on going by the internal revenue service  and the open years subject to audit are currently tax years for most states where the company conducts business  the company is subject to examination for the preceding three to six years 
asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
the number of days outstanding for trade accounts receivable increased from days at december   to days at december  primarily due to administrative delays in getting billings completed on new projects and clients extending payments beyond payment terms 
we do not expect the number of days outstanding for trade accounts receivable to materially change in the first quarter of bad debt expense was approximately 
and 
of revenue for the years ended december  and we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million or of trade accounts receivable balance for each of the years and  respectively 
while we continue to manage this portion of our business very carefully  it is possible that our days sales outstanding  bad debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts will deteriorate if the economy continues to decline 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially face liability for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the sole or concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each new year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our first and fourth quarters may be less robust than our second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition because the majority of the company s revenue is recognized under cost plus contracts  significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition 
most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
however  timing of accounts receivable collections could have a serious impact in the company s liquidity 
also  the company is engaging in more development contracts with smaller companies 
we anticipate that collection risk will be greater on these projects and have instituted new policies relating to ascertaining the creditworthiness of new customers 
it is not clear how changes in the economy will impact smaller companies ability to undertake and finance these projects 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our revenue is largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts 
some contracts typically smaller contracts have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
the contract is awarded with a maximum aggregate revenue  referred to as the not to exceed amount 
the company does not earn revenue over the not to exceed amount unless we obtain a change order 
the company is not obligated to complete the contract once the not to exceed amount has been reached 
billings on time and material contracts are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
in accordance with statement of position sop  revenue and cost for these types of purchases are not included in total revenue and cost 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
during and  pass through transactions totaled million and million  respectively 
we had no pass through transactions in profits and losses on fixed price contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid for materials  equipment and subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed price contracts 
the company s inability to manage significant levels or increases in costs and estimated earning in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts could have a serious impact on the company s cash flow 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on fixed price contracts 
change orders change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change deliverables under a contract without adding new provisions 
either we or our clients may initiate change orders 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  manner of performance  equipment  materials  scope of work  and or the period of completion of the project 
change orders occur when changes are experienced once a contract is begun 
change orders are sometimes documented and in most cases the terms of change orders are agreed upon with the client before the work is performed 
other times  circumstances may require that work progress without the client s written agreement before the work is performed 
in those cases  we are taking a risk that the customer will not sign a change order or at a later time the customer will seek to negotiate the pricing of the additional work 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is more likely than not that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
we have a favorable history of negotiating and collecting for work performed under change orders and our bi weekly billing cycle has proven to be timely enough to properly account for change orders 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis as of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued value  including goodwill 
reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment calculations are components one level below our reportable operating segments 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including determination of an appropriate discount rate  projecting revenue growth and gross margins  estimating operating and interest expense and projecting capital expenditure levels are involved in making these fair value estimates 
as a result  actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in significantly different fair value estimates and therefore different decisions about the appropriate recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements 
as a result of these uncertainties  we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of the scenarios in the discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it negatively impacts our results of operations and financial position 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis for the year ended december  indicated no impairment to the recorded value of our goodwill assets 
the company recognized  of impairment in our automation segment in and did not recognize impairment for the year ended december  if the economic downturn causes the value of one or more of the company s subsidiaries to decline  the company might have goodwill impairment in future years 
deferred tax the company had net deferred tax asset balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
these net deferred tax assets are identified in footnote to the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the effective date of sfas for us was january  adoption of sfas has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standard for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for fiscal periods  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  this new accounting standard will not have an impact on our financial statements unless and until we enter into transactions that create noncontrolling interests 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will apply to englobal prospectively for future business combinations with an acquisition date on or after january  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation and changing prices the company is planning to incorporate certain provisions in its future fixed price contracts that would allow the company to recover a portion of certain unforeseen price changes in materials and labor that are not in the range of normally expected inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
or sfas no 
there are no material investments at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on our annual average line of credit obligation 
due to the current credit market  a greater concern might be the impact of a material violation of certain financial covenants in our credit agreement resulting in a re pricing of that agreement 
assuming an increase in interest rate to on our variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on an annual average line of credit debt obligation  plus a renewal or origination fee of equal proportion on a similar credit agreement 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
the company has no market risk exposure in the areas of interest rate risk from investments because the company did not have an investment portfolio as of december  currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
transactions in canadian dollars in our canadian subsidiary have been translated into us dollars using the current rate method  such that assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange during the appropriate fiscal period 
as a result  the carrying value of the company s investments in canada is subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  any revenue received from the company s international operations in other than us dollars will be subject to foreign exchange risk 
the percentage of revenue received from foreign customers is identified in the discussion of segment revenue 
most revenue received from foreign customers is paid to the company in u 
s 
currency  except for revenue collected by our canadian subsidiaries 
the canadian dollar is not subject to volatile price fluctuations compared to the us dollar
