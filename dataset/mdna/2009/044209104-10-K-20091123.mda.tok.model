with approximately  employees worldwide  ashland serves customers in more than countries 
established in as a regional petroleum refiner  ashland  during the past several years  has been focused on the objective of creating a dynamic  global specialty chemicals company 
in that process  ashland has divested certain noncore businesses  redesigned business models  and acquired businesses in growth markets like specialty additives  functional ingredients  water and adhesives to enhance ashland s specialty chemicals offerings 
ashland s acquisition of hercules incorporated hercules  in november  propels the combined company to a global leadership position with expanded capabilities and promising growth potential in specialty additives and functional ingredients  paper and water technologies  and specialty resins 
with the acquisition of hercules  ashland has expanded its international footprint as ashland s sales and operating revenues revenues generated outside of north america in increased to from and in and  respectively 
revenue by region expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue for the years ended september   and was as follows revenues by geography a north america europe asia pacific latin america other a revenues from the acquired operations of hercules are included herein from november  business segments as discussed above  ashland completed the acquisition of hercules in november ashland s reporting structure is now composed of five reporting segments ashland aqualon functional ingredients functional ingredients  previously hercules aqualon group  ashland hercules water technologies water technologies  which includes hercules paper technologies and ventures segment as well as ashland s legacy water technologies segment  ashland performance materials performance materials  ashland consumer markets consumer markets  and ashland distribution distribution 
for further descriptions of each business segment see the results of operations business segment review beginning on page m total consolidated revenue for  and as a percent of revenue by business segment was as follows revenues by business segment a functional ingredients n a n a water technologies performance materials consumer markets distribution a revenues from the acquired operations of hercules are included herein from november  m key developments during  the following operational decisions and economic developments had an impact on ashland s current and future cash flows  results of operations and financial position 
hercules acquisition ashland s acquisition of hercules in november was a significant step in achieving ashland s objective of creating a leading  global specialty chemicals company 
the new combined company is comprised of a core of three specialty chemical businesses specialty additives and functional ingredients  paper and water technologies  and specialty resins  which will drive ashland both strategically and financially 
this acquisition positions ashland to deliver more stable and predictable earnings  generate stronger cash flows and gain access to higher growth markets worldwide 
the transaction was valued at  million and included million of debt assumed in the acquisition 
as part of the financing arrangement for the transaction  ashland borrowed  million  which included million drawn on the million revolving credit facility  a million term loan a facility  an million term loan b facility  a million accounts receivable securitization facility and a million bridge loan that was subsequently replaced with the issuance of million senior unsecured bonds in may ashland retained million of assumed hercules debt 
as a result of the financing and subsequent debt incurred to complete the hercules acquisition  standard poor s and moody s investor services downgraded ashland s corporate credit rating to bb and ba  respectively 
in addition  ashland is now subject to certain restrictions from various debt covenants 
these covenants include certain affirmative covenants such as various internal certifications  maintenance of property  preferential security interest in acquired property  restriction on future dividend payments and applicable insurance coverage as well as negative covenants that include financial covenant restrictions associated with leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and total net worth and capital expenditure levels 
as a result of these new covenant restrictions  ashland s focus during was to pay down debt by concentrating on generating cash and savings from increased profitability from sales  reductions in operating expenses  working capital  capital expenditures and dividends  and the sale of non strategic assets  primarily business divestitures and auction rate securities 
this focus and efficient execution on these cash generation and savings opportunities enabled ashland to reduce debt by approximately billion in debt during despite a steep economic decline 
drew marine divestiture in august  ashland sold its global marine services business known as drew marine  a business unit of water technologies  to jf lehman co 
in a transaction valued pretax at approximately million before tax  which was subsequently reduced by million after giving affect to post closing adjustments related to working capital 
this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of million  which is included in the net gain loss on divestitures caption of the statement of consolidated income 
this sale reflects ashland s strategy to strengthen its core specialty chemicals businesses 
the drew marine business is a recognized global leader in providing technical solutions  high value products and services to the global marine industry  including chemicals and testing equipment  water treatment  tank cleaners and corrosion inhibitors  sealing and welding products  refrigerants and refrigeration services  engineered systems and products  fuel management programs and fire safety and rescue products and services 
economic environment ashland s financial performance during was severely impacted by a significant decline in demand within the markets it conducts business  a direct result of continued weakness in the global economy  especially within north america and europe  which began broadly at the end of ashland experienced significant volume declines of to across all of its business segments during despite this pressure  ashland was able to manage pricing and reduce costs  resulting in an overall improved gross profit margin 
this is particularly evident for consumer markets  where the gross profit as a percent of sales increased significantly during the twelve months ended september   compared to the prior year 
overall  ashland s aggressive pricing management and cost reduction initiatives outweighed the significant volume declines during  enabling ashland to increase operating cash flows and substantially reduce debt associated with the financing of the hercules acquisition 
cost structure efficiency and hercules integration programs during  ashland implemented operational redesigns program  primarily within ashland s water technologies and performance materials businesses  to take proactive steps to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure of the businesses 
this program continued during and was further expanded to capture additional cost saving opportunities 
in conjunction with the hercules acquisition in november  ashland announced an integration plan integration plan that targeted certain projected cost savings as part of combining joint and redundant services and facilities 
this m program focused primarily on capturing operational  selling and administrative savings within the combined company 
additionally  with the prolonged and significant deterioration of global economic demand during  ashland announced in january an additional cost reduction and organizational restructuring plan program  which was subsequently expanded in july  to further reduce ashland s overall cost structure 
a summary of each program  along with targeted savings and status as of september   is as follows program originally intended to produce annualized cost savings of million by the end of  primarily within the water technologies and performance materials businesses  was expanded to million by the end of essentially all cost savings initiatives related to this program have been achieved as of the end of integration program originally intended to produce synergy cost savings of million  was expanded to million in expected synergy savings by the end of as of the end of fiscal  ashland has achieved essentially all of the total run rate cost savings associated with this program 
program originally intended to produce reduced costs including various plant and operational efficiencies and significant reductions in travel and entertainment expenses of million 
this program was expanded to million and includes a specific million cost reduction program within distribution to realign the cost structure of this business and additional continued efforts to resize ashland to match the current global economic demand 
as of the end of  ashland has achieved approximately million in total run rate cost savings associated with this program 
other items included in the program announced in january  but not part of the totals above  reduced costs during only 
these items primarily included freezing wage and salaries globally for  except where legally mandated otherwise  with estimated savings of approximately million  and implementing a two week furlough program for most us and canadian based employees  that was essentially completed in june of  and several other job and benefits related actions 
furlough program savings totaled approximately million 
in total  ashland has achieved run rate cost reductions of million of the combined million in these cost reduction initiatives 
the cumulative effect of these restructuring activities has resulted in the elimination of approximately  employee positions and eight permanent facility closings through the end of and in total is currently expected to reduce the global workforce by a total of approximately  or by the end of as of september   the total restructuring cost incurred under the cost structure efficiency programs during was million  of which million during had been charged as an expense within the statement of consolidated income  consisting of million classified within the selling  general and administrative expense caption and million of accelerated depreciation charged to the cost of sales and operating expenses caption 
the remaining cost of million related to severance associated with hercules personnel  which qualified for purchase method of accounting in accordance with us gaap  and had no effect on the statement of consolidated income 
additional costs from reductions in resources or facilities may occur in future periods  which could include charges related to additional severance  plant closings  reassessed pension plan valuations or other items  although ashland does not currently expect these to be significant 
ashland anticipates completing these restructuring activities during for further information on ashland s cost structure efficiency and hercules integration programs  see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations consolidated review ashland s net income amounted to million in  million in and million in  or  and diluted earnings per share  respectively 
income from continuing operations  which excludes results from discontinued operations  amounted to million in  million in and million in  or  and per diluted earnings per share  respectively 
ashland s net income is primarily affected by results within operating income  net interest and other financing expense income  income taxes and discontinued operations 
operating income amounted to million in  million in and million in operating results in compared to increased as the acquisition of hercules businesses increased operating income by approximately million in  despite million in nonrecurring purchase accounting charges related to inventory fair value adjustments and in process research and development 
in addition  ashland incurred million for severance charges and accelerated depreciation for the ongoing integration and reorganization from the hercules acquisition and other cost structure efficiency programs 
these key items  along with significant volume declines across all business segments  severely effected operating results as compared to the prior period for legacy ashland businesses  but were more than offset by aggressive cost reductions  lower raw materials costs and the affects of price increases  particularly within the consumer markets segment 
operating results in compared to declined slightly as operating income decreases in performance materials and water technologies were offset by an operating income increase in distribution and income associated with unallocated and other 
m ashland incurred net interest and other financing expense of million during as compared to net interest and other financing income of million in and million in  with the current year expense primarily attributable to the debt issued in conjunction with the financing of the hercules acquisition 
the decrease in net interest and other financing income in compared to primarily reflects the lower interest rate environment for short term investment instruments 
in  ashland incurred certain significant nonrecurring items that included a million gain from the sale of drew marine  which was reported within the net gain loss on divestitures caption of the statement of consolidated income  as well as a million loss related to cross currency swaps and a million loss on auction rate securities  which were both caused by the hercules acquisition and reported within the other expense caption of the statement of consolidated income 
the effective income tax rate for of was significantly affected by the other expense caption items described above as well as certain resolutions to previously open foreign and domestic tax matters during the year 
the effective tax rate of during and during were impacted by several nonrecurring charges during the year as well as the resolution of specific foreign and domestic tax matters  but to a lesser extent than during discontinued operations was a million and million loss  respectively  during and and income of million during each year had various adjustments related to previously recorded divestiture gains as well as updates to the asbestos liability and receivable models  which in included a significant income adjustment of million after tax relating to improved credit quality in a certain receivable 
a comparative analysis of the statement of consolidated income by caption is provided as follows for the years ended september   and in millions change change sales and operating revenues revenues for decreased million  or  compared to the current year included  million  or  in additional revenues related to the acquired hercules businesses 
significant volume declines across all businesses substantially decreased revenue by  million  or  with unfavorable currency exchange rates decreasing revenue by million  or  compared to net price and mix decreases of million  or  also reduced revenues compared to as successful price management within consumer markets and water technologies were more than offset by price declines within performance materials and distribution 
revenues from the acquisition of the pressure sensitive adhesive and atmospheric emulsions business of air products and chemicals  inc air products within performance materials in june contributed an additional million  or  in revenues for increased million  or  from primarily due to increased pricing of million and million related to a favorable currency exchange as well as million from the acquisition of air products 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease related to declines in both volume and product mix as well as an additional million decrease related to the elimination of a one month financial reporting lag for foreign operations reporting lag during during  pricing increases were consistently implemented across each of ashland s businesses to recover significant cost increases occurring within volatile raw material markets 
volumes declined modestly  despite the difficult market conditions that continued to deteriorate the north american economy throughout  particularly in core sectors such as building and construction  coatings  transportation and marine 
the currency exchange rate is principally influenced by the us dollar s usd performance against the euro 
in millions change change cost of sales and operating expenses gross profit as a percent of sales cost of sales and operating expenses cost of sales for decreased million  or  compared to as increases related to the acquisitions of hercules and air products were more than offset by significant declines in volume and raw material costs in as compared to the acquisitions of hercules and air products represented a  million  or  increase in cost of sales for  which includes a nonrecurring charge of million associated with the inventory fair value adjustment of hercules acquired inventory 
additionally  a change in product mix increased cost of sales by million 
significant volume declines reduced cost of sales by  million  or  while currency exchange  due to the strengthening of the us dollar s average as compared to  reduced cost of sales by million  or 
decreases in raw material costs contributed an additional million  or  decline in cost of sales 
gross profit as a percent of sales gross profit margin increased by percentage points compared to as a result of the hercules acquisition  which included higher margin businesses  the mix of higher margin products sold during and improved pricing  particularly within consumer markets 
m cost of sales for increased compared to  which resulted in an overall decline in gross profit margin 
raw material price increases were the primary factor for this gross profit decline  which represented a million cost increase compared to as volatile pricing in the crude oil market  which experienced an approximate increase in the cost per barrel of oil during before peaking at over a barrel  also influenced other significant hydrocarbon based raw materials throughout currency exchange rates increased cost of sales million  while the air products acquisition added an additional million 
these cost of sales increases were partially offset by a combined million decrease related to volume declines and product mix as well as a million decline related to the reporting lag elimination during in millions change change selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses for increased compared to  with selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increasing percentage points as the acquisition of hercules businesses and several key charges increased this percentage

the acquisitions of hercules and air products added million in selling  general and administrative expenses excluding the severance and restructuring charges as compared to ashland s cost reduction initiatives and other items reduced expenses by million from  while currency exchange effects reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
for further information on cost cutting initiatives see the key fiscal developments discussion within management s discussion and analysis as well as note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased slightly compared to while decreasing percentage points as a percent of total revenue 
expenses impacting the comparability of compared to include charges recorded in that consisted of million for the voluntary severance offer  million for the elimination of the reporting lag and million related to an expense for certain postretirement plans 
these expenses did not occur in expenses during were negatively impacted by million for currency exchange and million for severance charges  related to realignment of certain businesses within ashland during  partially offset by million of decreased other costs 
in millions change change research and development expenses research and development expenses for doubled compared to and included a charge of million related to the purchased in process research and development projects at hercules as of the acquisition date

total equity and other income increased during compared to the increase in primarily related to improved performance from various foreign joint venture associations compared to in millions change change net gain loss on divestitures m net gain loss on divestitures includes the sale of drew marine  a division within water technologies  as well as the transfer of ashland s interest in marathon ashland petroleum llc map transaction along with two other businesses to marathon oil corporation marathon 
ashland recorded a gain of million during related to the sale of drew marine 
the gain in primarily relates to the settlement with marathon of certain tax related matters associated with the map transaction  which resulted in a million gain 
other gains and losses recorded during the three year period primarily relate to increases and decreases in the recorded receivable from marathon for the estimated present value of future tax deductions related primarily to environmental and other postretirement obligations 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on divestitures 
in millions change change net interest and other financing expense income interest income interest expense other financing costs the increase in net interest and other financing expense of million during primarily relates to an increase in interest expense of million compared to  which represents interest charges associated with debt drawn upon the closing  on november   of the hercules acquisition  which also increased other financing costs as compared to interest expense for includes million of amortization for deferred debt issuance costs  with million related to the bridge loan extinguishment that was converted into senior unsecured bonds during in addition  interest expense included million related to accelerated amortization from prepayments made on both the term loan a and term loan b facilities 
in conjunction with the hercules acquisition  interest income declined during as the remaining funding to complete the merger was paid from ashland s existing liquid investments 
the decrease of million in net interest and other financing income during compared to primarily related to the decrease in interest income to million in from million in  reflecting the lower interest rate environment for short term investment instruments compared to interest expense and other financial costs remained consistent from to in millions change change other expenses loss on currency swaps loss on auction rate securities other expenses included two significant nonrecurring items caused by the hercules acquisition 
the first was a million loss on currency swaps related to a swap associated with the hercules acquisition 
hercules had held a significant hedge against certain open currency swap positions that ashland immediately settled upon the acquisition 
the second was a million charge on auction rate securities as a result of a permanent realized loss on these securities due to the continued illiquid market these securities trade in and ashland s change in intent to no longer hold these securities until maturity 
for further information on auction rate securities see the liquidity discussion within management s discussion and analysis as well as note g of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in millions change change income tax expense effective tax rate the overall effective tax rate was significantly increased during due to several key factors 
using a statutory federal tax rate applied to the income from continuing operations for  income taxes would have been an expense of million 
significant discrete items for included an million valuation allowance on auction rate security losses and increases in the resolution and re evaluation of tax positions taken in prior years of million 
these discrete expense items were partially offset by research and development credits of million 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of ashland s tax provision for the last three years to the us statutory rate 
the overall effective tax rate significantly increased in from due to several key factors 
significant volatility in the capital markets as it relates to investments held for life insurance policies resulted in a million tax effect in  m which historically has been a tax benefit for ashland 
in addition  during ashland recorded a million tax benefit related to dividends held within the employee stock ownership plan compared with a million tax benefit in  primarily due to the special dividend of paid on october  as part of the distribution to shareholders of a substantial portion of the apac divestiture proceeds 
in millions change change income from discontinued operations net of tax apac asbestos related litigation reserves electronic chemicals during  ashland recorded two adjustments that related to prior periods within the discontinued operations caption of the statement of consolidated income 
these included a charge related to a change in the duration period on a retained environmental liability from the electronic chemicals business divested in and a charge related to a tax basis adjustment from the apac divestiture 
ashland assessed the affect these adjustments had on income from discontinued operations and net income in the current and prior periods and  after considering quantitative and qualitative factors  determined such adjustments to be below the threshold that would necessitate a restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the prior years 
ashland also considered the impact of these prior period adjustments on its internal controls and financial reporting and based on qualitative and quantitative factors  including the discrete nature of the transactions involved  concluded that the matters did not indicate a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting 
during and  subsequent tax adjustments reduced the gain on the sale of apac 
ashland periodically updates the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos related litigation reserves  which resulted in a net million charge in  and a favorable net million and million adjustment during and  respectively 
additionally  during a favorable million after tax adjustment was recorded due to a reassessed assumption for a certain asbestos receivable due to improved credit quality 
quarterly operating income loss the following details ashland s quarterly reported operating income for the years ended september   and in millions december march june september results of operations business segment review results of ashland s business segments are presented based on its management structure and internal accounting practices 
the structure and practices are specific to ashland  therefore  the financial results of ashland s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies 
ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved  more refined information becomes available and businesses change 
revisions to ashland s methodologies that are deemed insignificant are applied on a prospective basis 
during  ashland began fully allocating significant actual corporate costs as opposed to budgeted expenditures which was utilized in prior periods  except for certain significant company wide restructuring activities  such as the current restructuring plan related to the hercules acquisition described in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements  and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that ashland no longer operates 
to align prior period results to the current period presentation  ashland reclassified certain depreciation and amortization charges in and that were previously presented within the unallocated and other section to the applicable reporting segments that were originally allocated these corporate charges 
as previously discussed  ashland s businesses are managed along five industry segments functional ingredients  water technologies  performance materials  consumer markets and distribution

d distribution s gross profit as a percentage of sales for and include a lifo quantity credit of million and million  respectively 
there was no lifo quantity credit for as previously discussed  ashland s financial performance during has been severely impacted by significantly declining demand  a direct result of the continued weakness in the global economy  especially within the north american and european transportation and construction industries 
volume levels were down across all businesses  including operations acquired from hercules on november   decreasing anywhere from to versus despite this m pressure ashland has been implementing pricing improvements and has aggressively reduced excess capacity to match current market demands  which has more than offset the effects of the declining volume  as average selling prices are generally higher versus a year ago 
this coupled with significant reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses from the cost structure efficiency programs previously described further improved operating income during during  ashland s financial performance was also hindered by modest declining demand and significant raw material cost increases due to instability in raw material markets as compared to this economic environment created significant downward pressure on the gross profit margin of each business segment  particularly within the performance materials  valvoline and water technologies businesses during overall volume results during for the businesses were mixed  with water technologies and valvoline reporting slight increases compared to while distribution declined and performance materials levels were unchanged 
functional ingredients functional ingredients is one of the world s largest producers of cellulose ethers and pale wood rosin derivatives 
it provides specialty additives and functional ingredients that manage the physical properties of aqueous water based and nonaqueous systems 
many of its products are derived from renewable and natural raw materials and perform in a wide variety of applications 
functional ingredients reported operating income of million for since ashland s acquisition of hercules on november  during  this business incurred several significant charges that included a million inventory fair value adjustment and a million charge for purchased in process research and development  both associated with the hercules acquisition  as well as a severance charge of million 
revenues reported were million and included a significant one time sales transaction to an oilfield chemical supplier in the amount of million  which represented of revenues and of volume for sales per shipping day for was million and metric tons sold was thousand

its process  water treatment and functional chemistries are used to improve operational efficiencies  enhance product quality  protect plant assets  and ensure environmental compliance 
in august ashland sold its global marine services business known as drew marine  a business unit of water technologies  to jf lehman co 
in a transaction valued pretax at approximately million before tax  which was subsequently reduced by million after giving affect to post closing adjustments related to working capital 
the drew marine business  with annual revenues of approximately million a year  has approximately employees  offices and stocking locations in countries 
the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of million  which is included in the net gain loss on divestitures caption of the statement of consolidated income 
as part of this sale arrangement ashland has agreed to continue to manufacture certain products on behalf of drew marine 
compared to water technologies reported operating income of million for compared to million reported during significant volume declines related to the global economic downturn were more than offset by reductions within selling  general and administrative expenses  reductions to costs of goods  improved product mix and pricing  and the addition of the former hercules paper technologies and ventures business from the hercules acquisition 
current year results also included several charges related to this acquisition that included a million inventory fair value adjustment recorded within the cost of sales caption  a million charge for purchased in process research and development recorded within the research and development expense caption and a severance charge of million recorded within the selling  general and administrative caption 
revenues increased to  million compared to million  a direct result of the hercules acquisition  which contributed revenues of million 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a million  or  decline in volume and a million  or  decline attributable to foreign currency  while improved pricing and mix contributed an additional million  or  as compared to gross profit margin decreased percentage points to for  partially due to the million of previously mentioned acquisition related inventory charges to cost of sales as well as inclusion of the former hercules paper technologies and ventures business  which has historically been a lower gross profit business as compared to the legacy ashland business 
the acquired hercules business contributed million to gross profit while price increases and mix m improvements that reduced cost of goods sold  contributed an additional million to gross profit 
other items affecting the gross profit margin included a million decrease in volume and a million decrease attributable to foreign currency 
overall raw material inflation was experienced early in  with sequential moderation through the rest of the year  however  this was more than offset by successfully negotiated full service and municipal contracts that recaptured the increased raw material costs during the period 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during  as the million increase from the acquired operations of hercules was partially offset by a million reduction in selling expense  principally related to operational cost savings from restructuring the business subsequent to the hercules acquisition  and a million reduction attributable to foreign currency 
research and development expenses increased million during  primarily due to a million increase from the acquired operations of hercules  which included the million acquisition related charge for purchased in process research and development 
compared to water technologies reported operating income of million during  a decrease compared to million reported during  as lower gross profit margin and increased selling  general and administrative costs were the primary factors in this decline 
revenues increased to million compared to million during  primarily due to increases of approximately million  or  and million  or  in currency exchange and volume  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by an million  or  decrease in price and a million  or  decrease as a result of the reporting lag recorded in gross profit margin decreased percentage points to 
despite this decrease  gross profit increased million from as currency exchange and volume contributed increases of million and million  respectively  to gross profit 
these increases in gross profit were offset by cost increases in raw materials and services of million as well as a million decrease related to the reporting lag recorded during selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during primarily due to a million increase in currency exchange and a million decrease from costs associated with the reporting lag recorded during research and development expenses increased million during performance materials performance materials is a global leader in unsaturated polyester resins and vinyl ester resins 
in addition  it provides customers with leading technologies in gelcoats  pressure sensitive and structural adhesives  and metal casting consumables and design services 
compared to performance materials reported operating income of million for  a decrease from the million reported during significant volume declines during  primarily due to the global economic downturn  were partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
revenues decreased to  million compared to  million in decreases in volume of million  or  primarily due to significant weakness within the transportation  construction  packaging and converting and metal casting markets  currency exchange of million  or  and price declines of million  or  were the primary factors in the decrease in revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by revenues from the acquisition of air products which contributed million  or  to revenues 
excluding the effect of air products for  revenue decreased 
gross profit margin during remained unchanged at 
pounds sold per shipping day decreased to million during  which caused a million decrease in gross profit  while the effect of foreign currency decreased gross profit by million 
however  disciplined price management and aggressive reductions in manufacturing costs from excess capacity mitigated the gross profit margin decline from lost volume as price increases coupled with raw material cost decreases added million to gross profit  which included a million charge for plant closure costs 
the acquisition of air products contributed million to gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during as compared to  primarily due to a million decrease related to headcount and other cost reduction programs and a million decline in reduced corporate allocations 
these decreases were partially offset by increased severance charges of million during compared to research and development expenses declined million during compared to  which was also primarily related to headcount reductions and cost saving initiatives

increases in currency exchange of million  or  and price of million  or  were the primary factors in the m increase in revenue 
in addition  the acquisition of air products in june contributed million to revenues 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by volume and product mix decreases of million  or  primarily as a result of weakness in the north american markets for the composites and adhesives business unit  and a million decrease related to the reporting lag elimination recorded during the decrease in volume and product mix caused operating income to decline by million 
gross profit margin during decreased percentage points to primarily due to raw material cost increases of million 
these raw material cost increases were not fully offset by price increases during  causing gross profit and operating income to decline by million 
the decreases in gross profit related to price  volume and product mix were partially offset by an increase from currency exchange of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during as an increase of million and million related to corporate allocations and currency exchange  respectively  was partially offset by a million decrease in costs recorded from the reporting lag recorded during research and development expenses decreased million during equity and other income increased million during compared to  primarily due to a million increase in equity income associated with joint ventures

compared to consumer markets reported record operating income of million for  a increase compared to million reported during profit margin improvement was the primary factor in consumer markets record performance as well as successful implementation of various cost saving initiatives within operations and selling  general and administrative costs 
revenues decreased to  million compared to  million in increased pricing of million  or  and a favorable change in product mix of more premium lubricants sold during of million  or  partially offset volume declines in revenue of million  or  as lubricant volume decreased to million gallons during foreign currency declines also reduced revenue by an additional million  or  as compared to gross profit margin during increased percentage points to 
the combination of price increases that began in fiscal  lower raw material costs and cost saving initiatives positively impacted results causing an increase in gross profit of million 
this increase in gross profit was offset by net volume and mix decreases reducing gross profit by million and foreign currency declines of million compared to selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during primarily due to currency exchange decreases of million and reduced travel  entertainment and other expenses of million

a change in the product mix sold during reduced revenue by million compared to gross profit margin during decreased percentage points to 
despite this decrease  gross profit increased million from the prior period as currency exchange contributed an increase of million while price increases did not fully offset increases in raw material costs  causing a net million decline in gross profit and operating income 
the remaining difference was due to fluctuations within product mix  which caused gross profit and operating income to decline by million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during the current period primarily due to currency exchange increases of million

ashland distribution also provides environmental services in north america  including hazardous and nonhazardous waste collection  recovery  recycling and disposal services 
m compared to distribution reported operating income of million for  a increase compared to million for as significant declines in volume  primarily due to the weakness in north american industrial output  was offset by an improved gross margin and successful cost savings initiatives within selling  general and administrative expenses  which included some restructuring of excess capacity 
revenues decreased to  million compared to  million in primarily as a result of volume declines 
pounds sold per shipping day decreased to million compared to million in  causing a million decline in revenues 
decreases in foreign currency of million  or  and price of million  or  contributed to the overall revenues decline as price increase announcements with customers during have been met with limited success 
gross profit margin during increased percentage points to and benefited from a favorable million quantity lifo adjustment 
raw material price decreases resulted in a favorable contribution of million to gross profit  which includes the favorable quantity lifo adjustment 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in gross profit due to volume declines and a million decrease in currency exchange compared to selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during as compared to  with decreases in corporate allocations of million  incentive compensation and salaries of million  travel and entertainment of million and currency exchange of million as the primary factors 
these decreases were partially offset by severance charges of million incurred during compared to distribution reported operating income of million during  a increase from the million reported during revenues increased to  million compared to  million in the prior period 
price increases  primarily in certain chemicals and plastics  were the primary factor in revenue growth causing a million  or  increase with currency exchange increases adding an additional million  or 
these increases during were offset by a million decrease in volume  as pounds sold per shipping day decreased to million compared to million in  causing a decline in the gross profit and operating income of million 
the reporting lag recorded during resulted in an additional million decrease in revenue 
gross profit margin during the current period decreased percentage point to and benefited from a favorable lifo quantity credit of million 
despite this decline  gross profit increased million compared to as price increases offset raw material cost increases  contributing million to gross profit and operating income 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  during primarily due to increased charges for incentive compensation of million 
unallocated and other unallocated and other costs were million for compared to income of million for and costs of million in during  ashland began fully allocating significant actual corporate costs as opposed to budgeted expenditures which was utilized in prior periods  except for certain significant company wide restructuring activities  such as the current restructuring plan related to the hercules acquisition described in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements  and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that ashland no longer operates 
cost components for consisted of million for severance and plant closure charges associated with the ongoing integration and reorganization of the hercules acquisition and million in due diligence costs associated with investment opportunities and other charges  which were partially offset by a currency gain on an intercompany loan of million 
income components for included lower incentive compensation and direct support costs that were not reallocated back to the businesses that was partially offset by an million charge for costs associated with ashland s joint venture with cargill to manufacture bio based propylene glycol  which had been suspended due to persistently high glycerin input costs and other costs related to growth opportunities 
in addition to the ongoing costs that typically occur each year related to formerly owned businesses  included an million adjustment from favorable experiences related to ashland s self insurance program 
fiscal included million of income from reduced corporate expenditures and other costs as well as a million charge for costs associated with ashland s voluntary severance offer 
ashland s voluntary severance offer was initiated as a result of the apac divestiture in august as a result of the divestiture  it was determined that certain identified corporate costs that had previously been allocated to that business needed to be eliminated to maintain ashland s overall competitiveness 
as a means to eliminate those costs  ashland offered an enhanced early retirement or voluntary severance opportunity to administrative and corporate employees during fiscal in total  ashland accepted voluntary severance offers from employees under the program 
as a result  a million charge was recorded for severance  pension and other postretirement benefit costs during fiscal the termination dates for employees participating in the program were completed and paid in fiscal m financial position liquidity ashland s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows  are summarized as follows 
in millions cash used provided by operating activities from continuing operations investing activities from continuing operations financing activities from continuing operations discontinued operations effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows generated from operating activities from continuing operations  a major source of ashland s liquidity  amounted to  million in  million in and million in the increased cash generated during primarily reflects a cash improvement in operating assets and liabilities as compared to and  primarily attributable to changes within accounts receivable  inventory and trade and other payables as a result of ashland s increased focus on working capital management throughout the company 
these elements of working capital generated million of cash inflow during compared to a cash inflow of million in and a cash outflow of million in net income of million for included a noncash adjustment for depreciation and amortization of million as well as significant charges from the hercules acquisition and other items that did not occur in and  including an inventory fair value adjustment and purchased in process research and development amortization of million and million  respectively  debt issuance cost amortization of million  a currency swap loss of million and a million loss on auction rate securities 
these significant charges were offset by the gain associated with the drew marine sale of million 
operating cash flows for and included net income of million and million  respectively  and a noncash adjustment of million and million  respectively  for depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as compared to relates to the additional depreciation and amortization associated with the valuation of the acquired hercules operations and other acquisition related amortization 
the depreciation and amortization from these assets will be included in operations on an ongoing basis through the remainder of their useful lives as determined and as part of the purchase accounting fair value estimates discussed in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
ashland contributed million to its qualified pension plans in  compared with million in and million in and paid income taxes of million during  compared to million in and million in cash receipts for interest income were million in  million in and million in  while cash payments for interest expense amounted to million in  million in and million in cash flows from discontinued operations  consisting primarily of cash flows from apac  amounted to a cash outflow of million in  million in and million in investing activities cash used in investing activities was  million for as compared to million and million used by investing activities in and  respectively 
the significant cash investing activities for included cash outflows of  million for the purchase of hercules operations in november  million for the settlement of currency interest rate swap hedges related to the acquisition and million for capital expenditures 
these significant cash investing activities were offset by sales of auction rate securities during resulting in cash proceeds of million and proceeds from the fibervisions and drew marine sales of million 
significant cash investing activities for included net purchases of available for sale securities of million  million for capital expenditures and million for purchased operations offset by cash proceeds of million associated with the map transaction 
significant cash investing activities for included million for capital expenditures and million for the northwest coatings acquisition offset by million in cash inflow from available for sale securities 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for as compared to a million and a  million cash usage for financing activities in and  respectively 
significant cash financing activities for included cash m inflows of  million associated with short term and long term financing secured with bank of america securities llc  scotia capital usa inc and other lenders for the acquisition of hercules  including the subsequent senior notes due issued in may for which the proceeds were used to extinguish the bridge loan facility under the interim credit agreement discussed further in note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this cash inflow for was partially offset by cash used for the extinguishment of certain debt instruments that hercules held as of the closing date of the acquisition  the extinguishment of the bridge loan facility  previously discussed  and other debt prepayments made subsequent to the hercules acquisition that totaled  million 
in addition  million in debt issue costs were paid in connection with securing the financing for the hercules acquisition and the subsequent senior notes due issued to replace the bridge loan facility 
in total  as a result of ashland s focus and efficient execution on cash generation and savings opportunities  ashland was able to reduce debt by approximately billion of the debt associated with the financing of the hercules acquisition during cash dividends paid during were 
per common share and totaled million  a million reduction as compared to as a result of the reduction in the per common share dividend paid during and fiscal included a significant cash outflow of million for cash dividends paid and million for repurchase of common stock which are both discussed further in the capital resources discussion 
cash flow metrics at september   working capital current assets minus current liabilities  excluding long term debt due within one year amounted to million  compared to  million at the end of ashland s working capital is affected by its use of the lifo method of inventory valuation that valued inventories below their replacement costs by million at september   million at september  liquid assets cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable amounted to of current liabilities at september   compared to at september  the decrease in both working capital and liquid assets in is primarily the result of cash on hand used for the financing of the hercules acquisition 
the following summary reflects ashland s cash  investment securities and debt as of september  and september september in millions short term debt long term debt including current portion total debt cash and cash equivalents auction rate securities the scheduled aggregate maturities of debt by fiscal year for the next five years are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million in total borrowing capacity remaining under the million revolving credit facility was million  after reduction of the facility by million for letters of credit outstanding at september  with an additional million of borrowing capacity available through the accounts receivable securitization facility 
total short term debt at september  was million  which primarily related to draws on revolving credit facilities among international operations 
no short term debt was outstanding at september  the current portion of long term debt was million at september  and million at september  debt subject to variable interest rates as of september  was million 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates at september  would have resulted in an million increase or decrease in interest expense 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their current levels  with all other variables held constant 
based on ashland s current debt structure included in note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements and assuming interest rates remain somewhat stable  future interest expense could range from approximately million to million based on applicable fixed and floating interest rates 
as a result of the financing and subsequent debt issued to complete the acquisition of hercules  standard poor s and moody s investor services downgraded ashland s corporate credit rating to bb and ba  respectively 
covenants related to debt agreements ashland is now subject to certain restrictions from various debt covenants 
these covenants include certain affirmative covenants such as various internal certifications  maintenance of property and applicable insurance coverage as well as negative covenants that include financial covenant restrictions  these include leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  m total net worth and capital expenditure limitations 
the permitted consolidated leverage ratio at any time during any period of four fiscal quarters for ashland is as follows under the credit facility 
maximum consolidated leverage ratio for fiscal quarters ending funding date through september  december  through september  december  through september  december  through september  december  and each fiscal quarter thereafter the following describes ashland s september calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio per the senior credit agreement as previously disclosed in a form k filed on november  and reconciliation of consolidated ebitda as defined by the senior credit agreement  as amended to net income 
ashland has included certain non us gaap information below to assist in the understanding of various financial debt covenant calculations

c in accordance with the senior credit agreement  hercules financial results from october  through november   which is the period of time during ashland s first quarter that it did not own hercules  have been included within this calculation 
d includes certain nonrecurring or noncash transactions  including restructuring and integration charges  defined within the senior credit agreement 
allowable restructuring and integration charges are capped  per the senior credit agreement  as amended  not to exceed million during the three fiscal year period ending september  ashland incurred approximately million of qualifying restructuring and integration expenses in m the permitted consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter for ashland is as follows under ashland s senior credit agreement 
minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio for fiscal quarters ending funding date through september  december  through each fiscal quarter thereafter the following describes ashland s september calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio per the senior credit agreement included in a form k filed on november  in millions  except ratios a q q q q total covenant ratio fixed charge coverage consolidated ebitda capital expenditures adjusted interest expense scheduled debt payments adjusted dividend payment fixed charge coverage ratio x x min 
a all numbers adjusted to reflect terminology and calculation methodology governing the senior credit agreement  included in a form k filed on november   as amended 
under ashland s financing facilities  the minimum consolidated net worth covenant at the end of any fiscal quarter ending after december  must not be less than of ashland s consolidated net worth as of december   after giving effect to any purchase accounting adjustments relating to the hercules acquisition subsequent to december   increased on a cumulative basis for each subsequent quarter commencing with january  by an amount equal to of ashland s us gaap reported net income to the extent positive with no deduction for net losses plus of net cash proceeds of any issuance of equity interests other than disqualified equity interests 
as of september  ashland s consolidated net worth covenant was  million versus the minimum consolidated net worth covenant of  million  a difference of million 
as outlined above  this difference would be adversely impacted by any future operating losses  impairment including goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  pension remeasurement  severance or other related charges that reduce ashland s consolidated net worth 
ashland projects that cash flows from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving credit should be sufficient to meet investing and financing requirements to enable ashland to comply with the covenants and other terms of each respective financing facility 
these model projections are based on various assumptions that include  but are not limited to operational results  working capital cash generation  capital expenditures  pension funding requirements and tax payment and receipts 
any change in assumptions that would affect these cash flow projections by million would have an approximate 
x effect on the consolidated leverage ratio and a 
x effect on the fixed charge coverage ratio 
any change in debt of million would affect the consolidated leverage ratio by approximately 
x 
ashland is committed to fulfilling its debt obligations under the credit agreement 
if an event of default as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur and continue  the lenders under the credit agreement would have the right to declare the unpaid principal  interest and fees immediately due and payable 
ashland would also be required to cash collateralize any letter of credit obligations outstanding and the bank could exercise any other rights granted to them within the senior credit agreement 
if this were to occur  ashland would seek to amend the agreement 
there is no guaranty that the lenders would grant this amendment 
as of september   ashland is in compliance with all covenants imposed by ashland s credit facilities 
auction rate securities at september   ashland held at par value million student loan auction rate securities for which there was not an active market with consistent observable inputs 
in february  the auction rate securities market became largely illiquid  as there was not enough demand to purchase all of the securities that holders desired to sell at par value during certain auctions 
since that time the market for auction rate securities has failed to achieve equilibrium 
as a result  ashland determined that a temporary adjustment of million to the par value of these high quality instruments was required as of september  until the liquidity of the market returns 
m during the first quarter of  ashland liquidated million par value auction rate securities for million in cash proceeds and recognized a loss of million  which was the recorded book value of this instrument 
as a result of this sale  as well as ashland s current debt structure following the hercules acquisition and the ongoing impact from the current global economic downturn  ashland determined in the first quarter of that it no longer had the intent to hold these instruments until their maturity date 
as a result  ashland recorded the remaining million unrealized loss as a permanent realized loss in the other expenses caption of the consolidated statement of income 
a full valuation allowance was established for this tax benefit at december  because for tax purposes ashland did not have capital gains to offset this capital loss 
during  ashland sold million par value auction rate securities for million in cash proceeds which approximated book value 
in addition  during  ashland signed an agreement with ubs financial services  inc agreeing to sell a million par value auction rate instrument at its par value on or before june  as a result  ashland recorded a minimal unrealized gain associated with this settlement 
ashland s current estimate of fair value for auction rate securities is based on various internal discounted cash flow models and relevant observable market prices and quotes 
the assumptions within the models include credit quality  liquidity  estimates on the probability of each valuation model and the impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates 
any basis point change in the discount rate or three month adjustment in the duration assumptions would impact the internal valuation model by approximately million and million  respectively 
at september  and  auction rate securities carrying value totaled million par value of million  and million par value of million and were classified as noncurrent assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
due to the uncertainty as to when active trading will resume in the auction rate securities market  ashland believes the recovery period for certain of these securities may extend beyond a twelve month period 
as a result  ashland has classified these instruments as long term auction rate securities at september  and in ashland s condensed consolidated balance sheet 
capital resources during  ashland increased total debt by  million to  million and stockholders equity increased by million to  million 
the increase in debt was a result of the  million in secured financing from bank of america securities llc  scotia capital usa inc and other lenders for the acquisition of hercules  originally consisting of a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan a facility  an million term loan b facility  a million accounts receivable securitization facility and a million bridge loan  which was subsequently extinguished in may upon the issuance of the million senior notes due the total debt drawn upon the closing of the completed merger was  million which included amounts used to fund the million extinguishment of certain debt instruments that hercules held as of the closing date 
the remaining hercules debt assumed as part of the acquisition was fair valued at million as of the closing date 
the increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to the following million for the issuance of common shares for the acquisition of hercules  million from issuance of common shares under employee savings  stock incentive and other plans  and net income of million 
these increases were partially offset by regular cash dividends of million and other comprehensive losses of million  primarily related to pension losses 
debt as a percent of capital employed was at september  compared to at september  as part of the financing arrangements to acquire hercules  ashland is now subject to the following capital expenditure limits  which can be increased by any qualifying carryover from prior years million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in accordance with the senior credit agreement  of any capital expenditure amount set forth above that is not expended in the fiscal year for which it is permitted above may be carried over for expenditure in the next following fiscal year 
during  ashland s total capital expenditures per the senior credit agreement  totaled million  which was more than million below the required covenant and million below the combined actual capital expenditures of million for the twelve months ended september  for both companies 
in accordance with the senior credit agreement  an additional million will be added to the million minimum requirement for to arrive at the total capital expenditure covenant 
during  ashland recorded million for capital expenditures 
prior to ashland s acquisition of hercules on november   the hercules businesses incurred capital expenditures of million from october through november  which  in accordance with the senior credit agreement  are included in the covenant calculation for fiscal year ashland is currently forecasting million of capital expenditures for fiscal property  plant and equipment additions averaged million during the last three years and are summarized in note q of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  ashland used  million in capital to obtain hercules aqualon and paper technologies and ventures businesses 
during and  ashland used capital to acquire several businesses within performance materials  including air products in and northwest coatings in m a summary of the capital employed in ashland s current operations as of the end of the last three years follows 
in millions capital employed functional ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets distribution during  the board of directors of ashland decreased the quarterly cash dividend to cents per share 
this dividend was a reduction from the cents per share paid quarterly during and in total  ashland s annual cash outflow for dividends decreased by million compared to and in conjunction with ashland s new debt facilities  ashland is now subject to various covenants that may restrict certain future payments  which could include quarterly dividend payments  although ashland does not anticipate that will occur 
ashland did not repurchase any shares during or  but did repurchase million shares for million during the stock repurchase actions during were consistent with certain representations of intent made to the internal revenue service with respect to the transfer of map 
as part of the completed merger to acquire all of the outstanding shares of hercules in november  ashland issued million shares 
see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisition 
at september  and  million and million common shares  respectively  were reserved for issuance under stock incentive and deferred compensation plans 
on september   ashland s board of directors authorized the distribution of a substantial portion of the proceeds of the sale of apac to the ashland shareholders as a one time special dividend 
each shareholder of record as of october   received per share  for a total of million 
this amount was accrued as dividends payable in the consolidated balance sheet at september  and was subsequently paid during substantially all of the remaining proceeds were directed to be used to repurchase ashland common stock in accordance with the terms authorized by ashland s board of directors 
see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of ashland s share repurchase programs 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table aggregates ashland s obligations and commitments  which includes the former hercules businesses  to make future payments under existing contracts at september  contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable have been excluded

capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included in debt 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
e due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities  ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties 
therefore  these amounts were principally included in the later years column 
f ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
m off balance sheet arrangements as part of its normal course of business  ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments 
these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that ashland is unable to predict 
ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncement and its impact on ashland  see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  other liabilities and associated receivables for asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets tangible assets the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
buildings are depreciated principally over to years and machinery and equipment principally over to years 
such costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present 
such indicators include  among other factors  operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines and technological obsolescence 
recorded values of property  plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value  which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows assets held for use or net realizable value assets held for sale 
asset impairment charges are included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and were million in  million in and million in asset impairment charges for exclusively relate to corporate aircraft that were moved to assets held for sale upon the shutdown of the corporate aviation department during the year 
asset impairment charges for include an million charge related to pathguard pathogen control equipment 
as a result of water technologies decision to withdraw from this market during  these assets were written down to the approximate fair value of comparable assets 
total depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
included in depreciation expense for was million in accelerated depreciation related to the closure of plant facilities included within the cost of sales and operating expenses caption of the statements of consolidated income 
capitalized interest for was million and was not significant for and intangible assets in accordance with us gaap  ashland reviews goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment either annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
this annual assessment is performed as of july and consists of ashland determining each reporting unit s current fair value compared to its current carrying value 
ashland has determined its reporting units for allocation of goodwill include the functional ingredients  water technologies  performance materials  consumer markets and distribution reportable segments 
within the performance materials reportable segment  because further discrete financial information is provided and management regularly reviews this information  this reportable segment is further broken down into the casting solutions and composites and adhesives reporting units 
when externally quoted market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units 
historically  ashland has used a market m multiples valuation technique 
fair values were based principally on ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples of industry peer group companies for each of these reporting units and  as deemed necessary  a discounted cash flow model 
based upon recent market conditions  ashland determined during that a discounted cash flow model was a more representative valuation model to currently determine a business fair value 
discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions 
significant assumptions ashland utilized in these models included projected business results and future industry direction  long term growth factors ranging from to and ashland s weighted average cost of capital  which was determined to be 
ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be conservative estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to ashland s market capitalization  and implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of goodwill  ashland s valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment 
however  the estimated fair values of functional ingredients and water technologies reporting units did indicate results that were close to their carrying values  although ashland believes that this result is reasonable given all or a significant portion of these reporting units were purchased in a negative change in either the long term growth factor or weighted average cost of capital assumptions for these two reporting units would have resulted in a fair value at  or slightly below  ashland s current carrying value of these reporting units 
for the remaining reporting units  the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units by a significant amount 
ashland did compare and assess the total fair values of the reporting units to ashland s market capitalization at september   including the implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
while ashland s current market capitalization total was slightly below its current carrying value  the discounted cash flow models for each reporting unit summed together exceeded ashland s carrying value by approximately as of ashland s annual impairment testing date 
ashland believes its use of significant assumptions within its valuation models are reasonable estimates of likely future events 
because the fair value results for each reporting unit did not indicate a potential impairment existed  ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during  and ashland s assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives  including goodwill  could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit divestiture decision  negative change in ashland s weighted average cost of capital rates  growth rates or other assumptions  continued economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated  or another significant economic event 
significant future charges for impairments could impact ashland s ability to comply with the minimum consolidated net worth covenant  which is disclosed further in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of september   ashland recorded goodwill of approximately  million in connection with the purchase of hercules in november functional ingredients recorded  million of goodwill and water technologies recorded million of goodwill associated with the transaction 
in connection with the goodwill associated with this acquisition  ashland determined that a certain amount of the goodwill should be allocated to all reporting units because each reporting unit will benefit from synergies related to the acquisition that will increase these businesses overall reported profitability 
ashland calculated the increased value each reporting unit is expected to receive from the estimated synergy savings in determining the appropriate amount of goodwill to allocate for this transaction  which totaled the following million for performance materials  million for consumer markets and million for distribution 
employee benefit obligations ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover a majority of employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
benefits under these plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during those years of service 
in addition  the companies also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans  which provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled 
retiree contributions to ashland s health care plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
life insurance plans generally are noncontributory 
for further information  see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  in conjunction with the purchase of hercules  ashland assumed million and million of net liabilities associated with qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans  respectively 
the assumed hercules pension plan had a projected benefit obligation of  million as of the acquisition date 
certain key assumptions are used to measure the plan obligations of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 
ashland s pension and other postretirement obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions including the discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of compensation increase  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and certain employee related m factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
while no such caps exist for the assumed hercules postretirement plan  the current health care cost trend is not expected to have a material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the mercer pension discount yield curve spot rates 
ashland uses this approach to reflect the specific cash flows of these plans for determining the discount rate 
the discount rate determined as of september  was for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
the weighted average discount rate for ashland s us and us pension plans combined was as of september  ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the compensation increase assumptions for the us plans were for  for and for the rate of the compensation increase assumption for the us plans will remain at in determining ashland s pension costs for the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be in  in and in the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans was assumed to be in  in and in for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to a loss of in and an actual return of in however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its us pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
in  of the pension portfolio was shifted from equity investments to alternative assets that historically have had a higher rate of return than equity investments  prompting an increase in the expected return on us plan assets to in determining ashland s pension costs for ashland estimates total fiscal pension costs for us and non us pension plans to be approximately million 
shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions a a increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate decrease in the expected return on plan assets increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate a excludes hercules pension and other postretirement plans assumed during as part of its acquisition by ashland 
income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under us gaap  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date changes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from ashland s estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material affect on the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet 
m as a result of the hercules acquisition during  significant historical tax positions and structures related to this company have been combined within ashland 
some of these previous tax positions and structures from hercules have required a complete reassessment regarding certain of ashland s pre acquisition tax positions and structures 
as such  material changes in certain tax matters may occur in the future based on deviations from ashland s current estimates and assumptions in combining these tax positions and structures 
in june  us gaap prescribed a new recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this also provided guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
ashland adopted these provisions effective october  the cumulative effect of adoption resulted in a reduction to the october  opening retained earnings balance of less than million

asbestos related litigation ashland and hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland  have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions  ashland retained hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims  and litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
the claim experience of ashland and hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ashland asbestos related litigation the claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups  the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent update completed during  it was determined that the reserve adjustment for asbestos claims should be increased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  excluding the hercules asbestos claims further described below  ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide most of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
for the ashland asbestos related obligations  ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best  as of september  the remainder of the insurance receivable is due from london insurance companies  which generally have lower credit quality ratings  and from underwriters at lloyd s  whose insurance policy obligations have been transferred to a berkshire hathaway entity 
ashland discounts this piece of the receivable based upon the projected timing of the receipt of cash from those insurers unless likely settlement amounts can be determined 
at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million excluding the hercules receivable for asbestos claims  of which million relates to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve described above  and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from m insurers  was updated 
this model update along with potential settlement adjustments caused an additional million net increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
hercules asbestos related litigation hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland  has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market 
because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups  the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in november  ashland completed its acquisition of hercules 
at that time  hercules recorded reserve for asbestos claims was million for indemnity costs 
hercules accounting policy in recording reserves for asbestos claims was to reserve at the lowest level of an estimated range of exposure for indemnity claims  excluding estimates of future litigation defense costs 
ashland s accounting policy in recording reserves for asbestos claims is to include amounts for the best estimate of projected indemnity and litigation defense costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
as a result  ashland recorded a million increase to the asbestos reserve for hercules to include projected defense costs 
to do so  ashland utilized several internal models that it employs to estimate defense costs associated with asbestos claims 
during  ashland included the hercules claims within its annual assessment of these matters  which includes running various non inflated  non discounted approximate year models developed with the assistance of hr a and determining from the range of estimates in the models the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
based on ashland s assessment of the best estimate of the range of exposure from the most recent model results  an additional million increase was recorded  which was accounted for as an adjustment to hercules opening balance sheet because the adjustment related to claims that had been incurred as of the acquisition date 
total reserves for hercules asbestos claims were million at september  due to the number and diversity of hercules asbestos claims outstanding as of the acquisition date and how reliant the year models are on the accuracy of the claim data  ashland s review of the underlying claim files as part of transitioning to a standardized claims management approach remains in process 
ashland anticipates this will be finalized during the first part of fiscal once the review of the underlying claim files is completed  a final assessment of the hercules asbestos claims liability will be determined and any subsequent adjustment to the opening balance sheet will be recorded during in the period determined 
the amounts recorded as of september  represent ashland s best estimate of the liability based on the current status of the underlying claim files review 
as of ashland s acquisition date of hercules  all of the cash previously recovered and placed into a trust from the settlements with certain of hercules insurance carriers had been exhausted 
with the addition of estimated defense and indemnity costs  the total hercules asbestos reserve exceeded the amount needed to obtain reimbursements pursuant to coverage in place agreements with certain other insurance carriers 
accordingly  ashland initially estimated at the acquisition date the amount of future projected costs that will be reimbursable by such insurance using a similar methodology as performed on the historical ashland asbestos liability and recorded a million receivable within the noncurrent asbestos insurance receivable caption of the consolidated balance sheet 
upon completion of the annual update during  the receivable was increased by million reflecting the increase in liability from the updated model incorporated within ashland s complete valuation process 
as of september   the receivables from insurers amounted to million 
this estimated receivable exclusively consists of domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by am best  as of september  asbestos litigation cost projection projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for ashland and hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models was developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
ashland has estimated in various current approximate year models that it is reasonably possible m that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately million for the ashland asbestos related litigation and approximately million for the hercules asbestos related litigation or approximately billion in the aggregate  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
environmental remediation ashland and hercules are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland and or hercules have been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations amounted to million at september  compared to million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of the hercules acquisition on november   ashland assumed all hercules environmental and asset retirement obligation contingencies 
hercules obligations assumed by ashland were million  which includes an increase of million for different remediation approaches than previously assumed under hercules valuation models 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering studies  probability techniques  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland discounts certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
at september  and  ashland s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was million and million  respectively 
environmental remediation expense is included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and on an aggregate basis amounted to million in  million in and million in environmental remediation expense  net of insurance receivables  was million in  million in and million in environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites is approximately million  which includes the hercules sites 
no individual remediation location is material  as the largest reserve for any site is less than of the remediation reserve 
outlook the past year has been extraordinary for ashland and the global economy 
ashland has taken aggressive steps throughout the year in realigning and resizing the cost structures of its businesses to match current global demand 
in addition  ashland integrated the operations and businesses from the hercules acquisition  which has created a global specialty chemical company with significant scale and strong positions within the markets our products serve 
through this period of significant global demand deterioration and unprecedented transition within ashland  the company was able to generate over billion dollars in operating cash flow generation  primarily from the business operations and working capital management 
this cash was principally used to pay down ashland s debt that was borrowed during to finance the hercules acquisition 
ashland s significant business redesign  integration of hercules and debt reduction during has significantly changed the company s operating leverage and repositioned it for enhanced earnings growth moving forward 
with the reduction of million from ashland s cost structure  two thirds of which is permanent  volume recovery within each business should increase margins and profitability above historical levels 
in addition  ashland now operates a diverse group m of businesses with operations in less cyclical but growing markets  such as personal care  pharmaceuticals and water treatment  which should provide stability through economic downturns 
however  it is ashland s operations in some of the more cyclical industries  such as transportation and construction  which may provide disproportionate revenue and earnings growth opportunities as these industries recover from the current economic downturn 
ashland s cash flow will continue to be a significant focus during as a result  ashland anticipates capital expenditures to remain below historical levels at approximately million 
in november ashland contributed million in ashland common stock to the qualified us pension plan  which has reduced ashland s expected pension expense and future funding requirements during as a result of this contribution  ashland anticipates that its pension expense will increase only million during  which is based on ashland s current accumulated benefit funding status of as of september   giving affect for the million stock contribution 
in addition  ashland expects its blended interest rate on outstanding debt to average approximately in  which is expected to require cash interest payments of approximately million 
while significant cash generation has occurred in the past two years from ashland s percentage point decrease in trade working capital  ashland anticipates this level will be maintained or slightly improved during during a turbulent and unsettled global economy ashland has demonstrated its ability to generate improved operating results and strong cash flow  while significantly rescaling the overall company 
ashland s current operating leverage and strong cash flow generation performance has positioned it well to capitalize on future periods of increased global demand  which should produce sustained revenue and earnings growth 
effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
ashland s monetary liabilities currently exceed its monetary assets  leaving it less exposed to the effects of future inflation than in the past  when that relationship was reversed 
however  given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the us in the past several years as well as forward economic outlooks  current inflationary pressures seem moderate 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating at least part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis md a contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the statements include those made with respect to ashland s operating performance and ashland s acquisition of hercules 
these expectations are based upon a number of assumptions  including those mentioned within the md a 
performance estimates are also based upon internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  operating efficiencies and economic conditions  such as prices  supply and demand  cost of raw materials  weather and legal proceedings and claims including environmental and asbestos matters 
these risks and uncertainties may cause actual operating results to differ materially from those stated  projected or implied 
such risks and uncertainties also include those with respect to ashland s strategic transformation  including the risk that the benefits anticipated from the hercules transaction will not be fully realized  the substantial indebtedness ashland has incurred to finance the acquisition of hercules may impair ashland s financial condition  the restrictive covenants under the debt instruments may hinder the successful operation of ashland s business  and other risks that are described in filings made by ashland with the securities and exchange commission sec 
although ashland believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot assure the expectations reflected herein will be achieved 
this forward looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized or if other unexpected conditions or events occur 
other factors  uncertainties and risks affecting ashland are contained in risks and uncertainties in note a to the notes to consolidated financial statements and in item a of this annual report on form k 
ashland undertakes no obligation to subsequently update or revise the forward looking statements made in this form k to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k 
m item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
at september  and  ashland had no derivative contracts that qualified for hedge accounting 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on ashland s open foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would not significantly affect ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
ashland did not transact or have open any hedging contracts with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements for the year ended september  see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments
