see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a presentation of certain of the above information on a quarterly basis for each of the four quarters in the years ended december  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill and impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our goodwill at least annually and at any other time if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
our long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
during fourth quarter  we concluded that the current economic environment and the significant declines in our share price compared to our net book value represented significant adverse events  and therefore  we evaluated our goodwill and long lived assets for impairment as of december   under the two step model established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in evaluating our long lived assets for recoverability  we use estimates of undiscounted future cash flows of our individual reporting units and for goodwill our recoverability is measured by reference to fair value using after tax discounted cash flows 
as quoted market prices are unavailable for our individual reporting units  fair value was determined through the use of estimated future cash flows 
the estimated cash flows used to assess recoverability of our long lived assets and measure fair value of our reporting units were derived from current business plans developed using near term and long term management projections 
our asset impairment evaluations  including our annual goodwill impairment test  required us to make several assumptions in determining estimates of future cash flows to determine fair value of our individual reporting units  including near and long term revenue and cost assumptions 
our evaluation of goodwill and long lived assets resulted in the recognition of asset impairment charges totaling million in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to our acquisition of tet on april   we believe future events that could result in additional impairment of our goodwill and long lived assets include  but are not limited to  declines in the current economic environment or significant losses of our customer base in europe or in australia 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations  including the requirements of emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas  statement of position  software revenue recognition  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery of the products and or services has occurred  c the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize product revenue  including sales to distributors and sales under sales type leases  upon shipment of product 
we recognize services revenue when services have been provided and collection of invoiced amounts is reasonably assured 
routine recurring services include terminal repairs  help desk  on site technician visits  deployment and the provision of supplies 
amounts received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues from long term contracts that require substantial performance of customized software and hardware over an extended period are recorded based upon the attainment of scheduled performance milestones under the percentage of completion method 
operating lease revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term 
the units leased under operating leases are included in the balance sheet under property  plant and equipment 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables items can be divided into more than one unit of accounting 
an item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and 
table of contents if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items that do not meet these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for one or more of the delivered item s  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in cases in which there is not objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s  we either recognize revenue in accordance with sfas for items that are considered to be leasing under eitf and we have sufficient evidence to make our best estimate of the relative fair value of the delivered element or defer all revenue for the arrangement until the period in which the last item is delivered 
we present revenues net of sales taxes and value added taxes in our consolidated statement of operations in accordance with eitf no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statements 
share based compensation prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of income 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we also use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation expense  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation expense 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
for stock options with graded vesting terms  we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period on the accelerated method in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option award plans  rather than the straight line method 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options at december  that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
allowance for doubtful accounts payment terms for product and service trade receivables generally range from to days depending on the circumstances of each order or service contract 
payment on trade receivables from long term contracts is generally received within four months of the milestone approval date 
any payments not received within the agreed upon due date are considered past due 

table of contents we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
such allowance is computed based upon a specific customer account review of larger customers and balances past due as well as a general reserve against individually smaller accounts receivable balances 
our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  investigation into customers financial status  as well as consideration of customers payment history with us 
if we determine  based on our assessment  that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay  we will charge off the account receivables to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
sales type leases certain product sales made under a capital lease arrangement are recorded as a sales type lease in accordance with sfas lease contract receivables represent the total lease payments to be received reduced by lease payments already collected 
sales type lease revenues consist of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are earned 
an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio is recorded 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sales type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or customer credit conditions deteriorate  the allowance for uncollectible sales type leases may need to be increased 
unearned income  including an interest and maintenance element  is the amount by which the original sum of the lease contract receivable exceeds the fair value of the equipment sold 
the interest element is amortized to lease income over the lease in a manner that produces a constant rate of return 
the maintenance element is amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognition of the interest and maintenance income did not exceed of our net revenues in  or inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  adjusted for absorption of manufacturing variances  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
reserves for estimated excess and or obsolete inventory are recorded on a product or part level basis based upon historical usage and future demand and establish a new cost basis for the respective item 
for components not yet billed to us by our third party contract manufacturers  contingent liabilities are recorded by component based on the likelihood of our ultimate usage of the components 
product warranty we accrue for estimated warranty obligations when revenue is recognized based on an estimate of future warranty costs for delivered products 
such estimates are based on historical experience and expectations of future costs 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the accrued warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
our warranty period typically extends from one to five years from the date of shipment 
costs associated with maintenance contracts  including extended warranty contracts  are expensed when they are incurred 
actual warranty costs may differ from management s estimates 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  intellectual property rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 

table of contents foreign currency assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the united states with a functional currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates 
revenue  costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year 
foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
for subsidiaries operating outside the united states where the functional currency is us dollars  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currency are remeasured at year end exchange rates whereas non monetary assets  including inventories and property  plant and equipment  are reflected at historical rates 
revenue  costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year 
any gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in foreign currency loss on our consolidated statements of operation 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded net gains losses on remeasurement of million  million and  respectively 
for the same periods  we recorded net gains losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies of million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts are included in the results of operations 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax laws including rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries because earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
overview of financial results the following overview highlights certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance over the past three years 
year overview on april   we completed our acquisition of tet for approximately million in cash 
tet was a leading provider of secure card payment solutions in some of europe s largest markets  including france  germany  spain and the united kingdom 
with the acquisition  hypercom became one of the largest providers of electronic payment solutions and services in western europe  solidifying our position as the third largest provider globally 
net revenue for the twelve months ended december  was million  a increase over the twelve months ended december  the primary reason for the increase was due to our acquisition of tet on april  which accounted for the majority of the increase 
in addition  we have seen a strong increase in demand for our countertop and multilane products in the us  as well as an increase in our service business in brazil 
product gross profit was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  product gross profit increase is principally due to the result of higher gross margin on tet product sales  changes in product mix for countertop  mobile  and multilane products  as well as efficiencies gained from transitioning to contract manufacturing during the first half of we expect to see continued efficiencies gained from our move to a contract manufacturing model in the future  although actual results may be materially different than our expectations 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred a net loss of million per share  which was principally due to the expense related to our evaluation of goodwill and long lived assets that resulted in the recognition of asset impairment charges totaling million 
these charges were primarily related to our acquisition of tet on april   additional expenses related to contingent liabilities recorded for potential commitments to purchase potentially excess and obsolete inventory at our third party contract manufacturer  the cost moving to outsourcing of manufacturing  acquisition expenses  integration expenses  amortization and interest incurred related to our acquisition of tet all added to the net loss for the year 

table of contents year overview for  we recorded a net loss of million per share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million 
products revenue increased million or over due to gains achieved principally in semea  as well as the americas with an increase within this segment in mexico  the caribbean and central america mcca  offset by declines in north america 
the increases in product revenue resulted principally from gains in mobile and multi lane products 
services revenue increased million or over principally due to the acquisition of tpi in late december and of acg in february noted below  which contributed an incremental million and million  respectively  and the billing and collection of past service contract fees of million  the costs of which were written off in when acceptance of the billing and collection was deemed to be doubtful 
in addition  we experienced growth in our two significant service operations in the americas segment due to higher volume type services in brazil and an increased installed terminal base in mexico 
the net loss in was principally the result of million increase in our inventory reserves primarily related to non pci compliant products and components and restructuring activities to reconfigure our global sales and marketing organizations  as well as the outsourcing of manufacturing and consolidation of software  repairs and maintenance functions globally 
these activities included the following outsourcing our manufacturing requirements to a third party contract manufacturer  including supply chain  production  assembly  and testing previously performed in shenzhen  china and in atibaia  brazil 
transitioning of our entire manufacturing operations in shenzhen  china to third party manufacturing partner locations  which commenced in and was expected to be completed in shut down of manufacturing operations in atibaia  brazil in accordance with our plans to cease negative margin terminal sales 
this activity was completed during the third quarter of  consolidating global software development activities to singapore  latvia  and india  and reducing similar activities previously performed in the us and sweden 
the consolidation of global development activities was completed in  relocating us service and repair operations from phoenix  arizona to hermosillo  mexico  which was completed in  and reorganizing and reducing the manufacturing and operations management team in phoenix  arizona consistent with the move to third party contract manufacturing  which commenced in and was expected to continue during as a result of these actions  we incurred charges of million during of which million of cost is in the americas segment  million in the asia pacific segment  million in the semea segment and million in shared cost centers 
these costs are exclusive of any reversals of stock based compensation 
we expect additional costs associated with these and other related activities that will take place during the first and second quarters of to approximate million 
the estimated costs are based on planned activities and circumstances known by us as of the filing of the annual report on form k 
however  due to the inherent risk of the activities being undertaken  we cannot provide assurance that these estimated additional costs will not exceed million 
in february  we acquired the assets of acg  a provider of installation  technical support and help desk services for point of sale equipment in australia for million 
the acquisition builds on our existing card payment terminal business in australia and expands our service business footprint in the asia pacific marketplace  providing merchant support for all vendors point of sale terminals in australia as well as a business platform for potential expansion throughout the region 

table of contents in june  we completed the sale of our headquarters facilities located in phoenix  arizona  for a gross sales price of million 
we recorded a gain of million on the sale in the second quarter of we have entered into a long term operating lease for our new headquarters with annual net rentals approximating million commencing in march and concluding in approximately to years  depending on whether we elect to terminate the lease after the initial years 
year overview for  we recorded net income of million per diluted share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million 
products revenue gains were achieved in central and eastern europe  russia and the commonwealth of independent states  middle east and africa  as well as mexico and south america from increased sales of our optimum t product 
we experienced declines in the multilane sector in north america due to the completion of a significant order in the first half of as well as the effects of transitioning from a direct to indirect sales model for that product line  and we experienced declines in our pacific region due to reduction in product volume at a large customer in australia and a slow down in the new zealand market and emv migration 
our service revenues increased by in to million principally from gains in brazil due to new service contract awards  including servicing competitor products  as well as increased terminal sales  which were put under existing service contracts 
the return to profit in from losses in and resulted from favorable impacts of actions taken after our comprehensive business review see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein the business review  which improved profitability 
these actions resulted in a lower cost structure  a streamlined product line  an increase in revenues from newer bit products and the establishment of a global product marketing group 
as of december   we had million remaining in liabilities associated with the business review compared to million at december  during  million of the million was reversed out through earnings as a result of customers opting out of a particular warranty program and a change in severance benefits paid out 
the remaining liability balance at december  relates to a particular warranty matter in australia of million where we expect to replace certain faulty units in and the balance of an idle facility charge of million expected to be paid out through we also experienced a favorable impact of a gain on the sale of real property in hong kong and had a net positive contribution from interest income less interest expense and foreign exchange losses 
in december  we acquired the assets of tpi  which resulted in a charge of million related to acquired in process research and development 
while this acquisition is expected to contribute significantly toward both our product and services offerings  the contribution in was not material 
our cash and short term investments amounted to million as of december  this balance decreased from december  due to the acquisition of tpi  use of cash in operations  and our purchase of additional treasury shares

of the million increase in products revenue during  million is attributable to the acquisition of tet 
excluding the additional tet product revenue  the increase in products revenue of million is a result of increases in unattended sales in semea and asia pacific of million 
other increases in revenue were due primarily to increases in multi lane sales in the americas and nemea of million offset primarily by decreases in mobile sales in the americas and semea of million 
of the million increase in services revenue during  the majority is attributable to the acquisition of tet 
other areas of changes in the service revenue were due to growth in our service operations due to higher volume type services in brazil of million offset by a decline of million in mexico as the result of the loss of a significant service contract whereby our customer was acquired and changed their outsource strategy 
offsetting this net increase was the billing and collection of past service contract fees in brazil during of million

we expect to see continued efficiencies gained from our move to a contract manufacturing model in the future  although actual results may be materially different than our expectations 
in addition  gross profit in was negatively impacted by approximately million of one off charges for inventory not in compliance with industry security standards as well as other costs to begin the transition to contract manufacturing

operating expenses research and development research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expense increased approximately million or in compared to  primarily related to the acquisition of tet

selling  general and administrative expense increased approximately million or in compared to  primarily related to the acquisition of tet 
excluding tet  selling  general and administrative expense would have increased by million  primarily due to an increase in professional fees of million principally from legal expenses  increase in salary of million principally from human resources and information technology headcount  increase in depreciation of million and commissions of million 
these were offset by decreases in bad debt expense of million and bonus of million 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for and for this decrease was primarily due to operating expense synergies related to the acquisition of tet 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during fourth quarter  we concluded that the current economic environment and the significant declines in our share price compared to our net book value represented significant adverse events  and therefore  we evaluated our goodwill and long lived assets for impairment as of december  our evaluation of goodwill and long lived assets resulted in the recognition of asset impairment charges totaling million for  primarily related to our acquisition of tet on april   amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles expense increased approximately million or in compared to  primarily related to the acquisition of tet and the amortization of our purchased intangible assets 
gain on sale of real property during the second quarter of  we completed the sale of our former headquarters facilities located in phoenix  arizona  for a sale price of million 
we recorded a gain of million on the sale in the second quarter of there were no such sales during interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income in compared to million in this decrease is principally attributable to lower average cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances in compared to due to the acquisition of tet 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the acquisition financing of tet 
approximately million of interest expense was converted to principal in accordance with the agreement 
foreign currency losses totaled million in compared with million in the increase in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to net unfavorable movements of currencies not hedged and a general increase in hedged exposure increasing the direct cost of hedging 
income tax expense income tax expense for federal  state and foreign taxes was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase in income tax expense was due to taxable income in our nemea and semea segments and taxable income in brazil which by law could not be offset against prior net operating loss carryforwards 
during  we continued to provide a valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
that valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas no

gross margin related to services has declined principally due to competitive pressures and changes in service mix in our key service market of brazil 
although management has taken certain actions to address improving gross margins  the impact of pricing and service mix in brazil will likely continue to have a negative impact in our service margins for the foreseeable future 
the services gross margin was also impacted by charges primarily related to a contract loss with a european customer and severances related to cost reductions in brazil 
partially offsetting these charges were the high margin sale of a software license  as well as the effect of performing additional services in mexico without a corresponding increase in the cost base

this amount was written off at the date of the acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
business combinations accounted for by the purchase method fin as there were no alternative future uses 
management determined the value assigned to this asset through various methods including assistance from a third party valuation firm in valuing the tpi business 
as of the valuation date  there were seven projects that were considered to be in process 
the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the in process projects 
these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating expenses  cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the in process technology 
these net returns were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving commercial readiness 
we believe the assumptions used in valuing in process research and development are reasonable  but are inherently uncertain 
as of december  all of the in process research and development projects associated with the purchase of tpi had been completed 
selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  and facilities operations make up the selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for and for selling  general and administrative expenses of million for include million of merger and acquisition costs  executive severance and collection costs related to the brazil service contract fees  offset by reductions in performance based stock compensation and favorable litigation settlements 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million for  include million in payroll tax charges associated primarily with former employees in china  offset by million in net favorable tax settlements in brazil  reductions in severance related liabilities and accounts receivable allowance recoveries

interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income in  compared to million in this decrease is principally attributable to lower average cash  cash equivalent  and short term investments balances maintained throughout compared to  offset partially by increasing yields on our cash investments 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the pay off of mortgage debt in april  as well as the non recurrence of interest penalties incurred in on china payroll tax charges 
foreign currency losses totaled million in  compared with million in the increase in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to net unfavorable movements of currencies not hedged and a general increase in hedged exposure increasing the direct cost of hedging 
income tax expense income tax expense for federal  state and foreign taxes was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
income tax expense is principally comprised of income taxes associated with our profitable foreign locations 
during  we continued to provide a valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
that valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and occasionally from borrowings under a line of credit and or other debt facilities 
during  our primary source of cash was cash generated by our operations  as well as cash received from a debt instrument used to finance the tet acquisition 
our ability to service our long term debt  to remain in compliance with the various restrictions and covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts  will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which in turn is subject to  among other things  future operating performance  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control 
we have available to us  upon compliance with certain conditions  a revolving credit facility  less any letters of credit outstanding under the sub line of the revolving credit facility 
outstanding availability under our revolving credit facility for cash and outstanding letters of credit was million as of december  outstanding letters of credit under this revolving line of credit at december   was million

cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled million for  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for  a year over year increase of million 
the increase in cash provided by operations is principally related to changes in operating assets and liabilities  offset partially by the net loss 
changes in operating assets and liabilities and the related impact on our operating cash flows consist of the following change accounts receivable inventories accounts payable other increase decrease in operating assets and liabilities the net increase in cash was from improved collection of our accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
net cash was negatively impacted due to an increase in inventory levels  as well as increases in accrued payroll and related expenses  accrued liabilities primarily from professional services and deferred revenues primarily due to the tet acquisition 
cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities of million consist principally of capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million and the acquisition of tet during which resulted in cash expenditures of million 
this was partially offset by cash provided by the net proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million 
the capital expenditures were principally for upgrades to computer software and hardware related to the tet acquisition  manufacturing tools and equipment related to new product launches and our move to contract manufacturing  and expenditures related to outfitting the new corporate headquarters 
depending on the global economic environment  we intend to spend approximately to million over the next twelve months for capital expenditures related to computer software to further integrate the tet acquisition and for manufacturing tools and equipment for new product launches 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities of million consist principally of the proceeds of the tet acquisition debt of million  offset by the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options  repayment of long term debt  and debt issuance costs 
projected liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents were million and short term investments were million 
the amount of consolidated cash and short term investments is subject to intra month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations 

table of contents on january   we entered into a loan agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million with the ability to borrow up to million if certain conditions are met 
available borrowings under the loan agreement are subject to borrowing base calculations based on the value of eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the loan agreement includes customary covenants and certain negative covenants prohibiting the occurrence of certain types of debt  limiting capital expenditures or disposing of assets 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by the inventory and accounts receivable of certain of our subsidiaries in the us and the uk the remaining balance of our consolidated assets are unencumbered under the loan agreement and  if needed  may be used as collateral for additional debt 
during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of tet for approximately million in cash  which included a base purchase price of million and approximately million of cash and working capital adjustments 
to fund the acquisition  on february   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with francisco partners ii  lp fp ii 
the credit agreement provided for a loan of up to million to partially fund the acquisition at closing 
the loan under the credit agreement bears interest at per annum  provided that  at our election  interest may be capitalized and added to the principal of the loan to be repaid at maturity 
the loan was funded by an affiliate of fp ii  fp hypercom holdco  llc the lender 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are due four years from the funding date of march  based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under our revolving credit facility or other financing options  will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations and our tet acquisition debt requirement through the next months 
we believe that our cash reserves and short term investments combined with our loan agreement and our ability to influence operating cash flows  as well as certain investing and financing cash outlays  will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements through should operating results prove unfavorable  we may need to obtain additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods dollars in thousands 
less than after total year years years years long term debt operating leases minimum purchase obligations total minimum purchase obligations include all outstanding obligations to purchase goods or services at december  including agreements that are cancelable without penalty and agreements  which are enforceable and legally binding 
we estimate that approximately of the outstanding purchase obligations at december  are non cancelable due to the customized nature of the order and the long lead time requirements 
our long term debt obligation includes principal and accrued interest through the maturity of the debt in this assumes the debt will not be prepaid before maturity and the amount presented above reflects this estimate 

table of contents debt amendments on march   we entered into a line of credit agreement with a bank pursuant to which we had access to a million line of credit 
borrowings under the credit agreement were fully collateralized by short term investments held in our investment accounts with the bank 
any borrowings bore interest at a rate set forth in each promissory note issued at the time of the advance 
the credit agreement contained customary default provisions and was set to expire on march   but was extended to march  stock repurchase during august  the board authorized a stock repurchase program to allow the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
during november  the board authorized a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to an additional million of our common stock 
during march  we announced the adoption of a rule b plan for the repurchase of up to million of common stock pursuant to the terms of an existing repurchase authorization 
during and  we purchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million  respectively 
there were no treasury stock repurchases during and the repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock and resulted in a reduction to stockholder s equity 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of under the share repurchase programs

r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised 
outlook we believe that uncertainty around the duration and extent of the global economic crisis  projected volatility in currency markets  and the decrease in available credit to both businesses and consumers will make a challenging year for most companies around the world 
we also believe our business will be further challenged by the issues within the banking industry and the general retail slowdown in north america 
regardless of these challenges  we will continue to focus on initiatives to drive toward profitability and to integrate the tet acquisition to a common product platform 
from a competitive landscape  we will continue to see competitive pressures on a global basis as we and our major competitors try to maintain and expand our respective market shares 
these pressures will generally serve to decrease average selling prices for certain products within certain geographies 
we intend to continue to offset declines in selling prices with further cost reductions in our products  as well as continue to differentiate our product and total electronic payment solution offerings from that of our competitors 
we will continue to manage our balance sheet and leverage our working capital to help meet the objectives of our key initiatives and in response to the global economic environment for impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our cash equivalent investments are primarily in money market accounts and certificates of deposit and are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days from date of purchase 
our interest rate risk with respect to existing investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned  which approximate current interest rates for similar investments 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material given that our discount notes have fixed rates 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our international operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
the majority of our revenue and expenses are denominated in euros and other non us denominated currencies 
as a policy  we hedge the translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than local in an attempt to neutralize the effect of translation gains or losses in the statement of operations 
financial hedging instruments are limited by our policy to foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
we enter into forward or option contracts with our bank or other financial institutions to accomplish our hedging strategy 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real  thai baht  mexican peso and australian dollar  with smaller contracts for the british pound and chilean peso 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consist of mark to market adjustments  which are recorded in earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 
as a result of significant variations in the currency markets during last half of and the potential for a material cash impact in settling of forward contracts  we may elect to suspend our hedging activities in relation to foreign currency forward contracts which could materially impact our non cash foreign currency gain or loss 
we do not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage 
see item a  risk factors international operations pose additional challenges and risks that if not properly managed could adversely affect our financial results elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
at present  all of our long term debt obligations are at a fixed interest rate over the term of the agreement and there are no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december   however  as of march   we have million outstanding against the line of credit at an interest rate of 
during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectability of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
