the hedges were required to limit the company s exposure to fluctuations in the underlying great british pound gbp purchase price of the enodis shares which could have ultimately required additional funding capacity under the new credit agreement 
subsequent to entering into the hedging transactions  the us dollar strengthened against the gbp which resulted in a significant change to the fair value of the underlying hedges 
financial accounting standards board statement fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities states that hedges of a firm commitment to acquire a business do not qualify for hedge accounting or balance sheet treatment

the crane segment benefited from a strong crane end market demand during the first nine months of as compared to the same period of due to the slowing world economy  the lower demand for cranes  especially for tower cranes  during the last months of were lower than the same period in from a product line standpoint  the sales increase was driven by increased volumes of crawler  tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  and increases in our aftermarket sales and service business  slightly offset by decreased sales of our boom truck cranes in north america due to the continued soft residential housing construction market 
as of december   total crane segment backlog was billion  a decrease as compared to the december  backlog of billion and a decrease versus the september  backlog of billion 
for the year ended december   the crane segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  operating earnings of the crane segment were favorably affected by increased volume across all regions and all product lines except for boom trucks  appropriate product price increases  and product cost takeout initiatives

table of contents foodservice equipment segment net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales increased or million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the sales increase during was driven by the million in net sales from the enodis business since its acquisition on october  excluding the sales from enodis  sales would have only increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
this increase was the result of price increases and a favorable currency exchange rate impact 
by region  strong sales in the asia markets and slightly higher sales in europe more than offset weaker sales in north america 
for the year ended december   the foodservice segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  the operating earnings decrease was mainly due to the operating earnings loss of million from the enodis business as a result of a million inventory step up purchase accounting adjustment recorded in the opening balance sheet and subsequently recognized as a charge to earnings for the quarter

market conditions and outlook during  we will strive to successfully execute our long term strategy of building market leadership positions in our two core markets cranes and related products and foodservice equipment 
in addition  since we have divested our marine segment we are now focusing all resources and management efforts on expanding our competitive position within our two remaining segments 
as a 
table of contents result of the global economic slowdown  we have taken actions and will make additional changes to our businesses as market dynamics continue to unfold in we intend to build on our leadership positions during this slowdown and emerge as an even stronger competitor 
looking ahead to  we have forecasted consolidated revenue of approximately billion 
this is based on estimated revenue of billion in the crane segment and billion in the foodservice segment 
we have forecasted operating margins in the low double digit range for both segments 
based on these assumptions  we expect earnings per share in the range of to per share  excluding special items  such as further restructuring costs 
other financial expectations for include capital expenditures not to exceed million  depreciation and amortization of million  and an effective tax rate in the mid range 
finally  we have set a year end debt reduction target of billion since funding the enodis acquisition in november of due to continuing weak market conditions and continued global economic uncertainty  we cannot be assurred of meeting these forecasts and actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
cranes and related products for the industry data currently available through the first three quarters of  manitowoc grew market share slightly in tower cranes  lattice boom crawler cranes  and truck cranes 
truck cranes increased due in part to the addition of the new tai an dongyue joint venture in china market and stronger sales in the us rough terrain market share was unchanged compared with with a slight decline in the us which was compensated by share growth in europe and the middle east 
all terrain crane market share remained level from to with gains in the americas compensating for declines in asia 
looking ahead  we expect sales volumes to decrease in as construction spend is expected to decline an additional versus worldwide in real terms according to global insight  and specifically non residential construction will remain flat versus similarly  the us construction market is expected to decline in the non residential construction decline in the us will be a significant contributor to this decline as it is expected to drop an additional for the year 
the impacts of any economic stimulus packages and especially those targeted to stimulate infrastructure and energy projects which are heavy crane markets  are unknown 
manitowoc will continue to improve our product lines and we have a variety of new product programs in queue for the next three years for all our product families as we continue to grow worldwide  especially in emerging markets through our new facilities in china  india and slovakia and we target other long term growth markets in russia and brazil 
along with product offerings tailored for growing markets  we will also expand and strengthen our renowned crane care global product support network to be well positioned for the long term in all major markets worldwide 
as the market declines  we will also use the opportunity to improve our design and manufacturing processes to ensure we maintain our reputation for high quality products for the long term into the recovery 
foodservice equipment the biggest negative economic factors in were the decline into recession for most economies  the spike in commodity costs  and the rise to record levels of oil prices that reduced disposable income and changed dining out patterns 
on the positive side  it was the continual effect of changing consumer demand on operators that translated into the need for innovative foodservice equipment that answered the call for new menu items  more efficient equipment  and new beverage offerings to try to increase same store sales 
regionally  asia continued its strong growth  in particular china driven by qsr expansion and project business driven by the olympic games in beijing 
the global economy continues to be our greatest concern in we believe the segments that performed well in could continue to benefit in the coming months quick service restaurants qsrs  which benefitted from consumers trading down from higher priced alternatives  institutional customers and large project business 
from a product standpoint we expect the demand for accelerated cooking products  custom refrigeration  and energy efficient products to outperform other products families 
we also believe end user chains will continue to seek new menu items to drive sales 
we expect all developed regions to experience continued economic weakness and for the emerging markets  primarily asia  to exhibit much slower growth 
with the enodis acquisition  we will continue with our history of bringing innovative products and services to the foodservice market  only now that market is much wider and diverse 
we will continue to develop customer driven solutions through more energy efficient equipment  integrated kitchen systems and products that do more while taking up less physical space 
the softer global economy will also focus our efforts to realize synergies more quickly and improve our overall development  manufacturing  and marketing processes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during was million compared to million in we applied a portion of this cash flow in to capital spending  dividends and payment of outstanding debt 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  versus million on hand at december  cash flow from operating activities during was affected by stronger earnings from continuing operations of million as compared to million in an increase in accounts payable of million also favorably impacted cash flow from operations 
the increase in accounts payable is related to higher levels of inventory as compared to the prior year 
these favorable impacts were offset by increases of accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in accrued income taxes of million 
the receivable increase related to higher sales of our crane products while the increase in inventory levels was also due to the higher sales in our crane segment negatively impacted by the downturn in crane demand we saw in the fourth quarter of the decrease in accrued income taxes relates to payments of accrued income taxes and overpayments of estimated income taxes which are now classified as a receivable as of december  net earnings from discontinued operations  before the non cash impairment charge of million  was million which also contributed to total cash from operations 
cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash provided from the sale of the marine segment 
net cash used in investing activities during was billion as compared to million during cash was primarily used to fund our acquisition of enodis for  million and the related million settlement of hedges implemented to reduce the currency risk of the gbp purchase price 
capital spending  excluding equipment held for rental  of million in was higher than the total of million primarily due to the upgrade and replacement of manufacturing equipment  support of new product development  improvement of information technology systems and completion of capacity expansion projects 
additionally  on december   the company received million from the sale of its marine segment 
cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt to effect the enodis acquisition and cash used by financing activities consist primarily of repayments of indebtedness and payments of dividends to shareholders 
financing activities resulted in a net source of cash of billion during compared to cash provided from financing operations of million during 
table of contents on october   we completed our acquisition of enodis  a global leader in the design and manufacture of innovative equipment for the commercial foodservice industry 
the billion acquisition  inclusive of the purchase of outstanding shares and rights to shares  acquired debt  the settlement of hedges related to the acquisition and transaction fees  the largest and most recent acquisition for the company  has established manitowoc among the world s top manufacturers of commercial foodservice equipment

in order to fund the enodis acquisition  in april  the company entered into a  million credit agreement which was amended and restated as of august  to ultimately increase the size of the total facility to  million new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement became effective november  prior to november   the company borrowed from its million amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of december  the new credit agreement includes four loan facilities a revolving facility of million with a five year term  a term loan a of  million with a five year term  a term loan b of  million with a six year term  and a term loan x of million with an eighteen month term 
the company has the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the revolving facility or term loan a  if agreed upon by the lender  up to an aggregate amount of million 
the company is obligated to prepay the three term loan facilities from the net proceeds of asset sales  casualty losses  equity offerings  and new indebtedness for borrowed money  and from a portion of its excess cash flow  subject to certain exceptions 
borrowings made under the revolving facility term loan a  and term loan x will initially bear interest at percent in excess of an adjusted london interbank offered libo rate as defined in the new credit agreement  or percent in excess of an alternate base rate  at the company s option 
borrowings made under the term loan b will initially bear interest at percent in excess of an adjusted libo rate as defined in the new credit agreement  or percent in excess of an alternate base rate  at the company s option 
the company cannot borrow under the alternate base rate option if that rate is lower than the adjusted libo rate 
a commitment fee applies to the unused portion revolving facility and is currently percent per year 
the new credit agreement contains financial covenants whereby the ratio of a consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and other adjustments  as defined in the new credit agreement ebitda to b consolidated interest expense  each for the most recent four fiscal quarters consolidated interest coverage ratio and the ratio of c consolidated indebtedness to d consolidated ebitda for the most recent four fiscal quarters consolidated total leverage ratio at all time  must each meet certain defined limits

the new credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default 
as of december   we complied with all affirmative and negative covenants inclusive of the financial covenants pertaining to our new credit agreement 
based on our forecasted operating results and related debt reductions  we have projected compliance will all covenants through march of our ability to comply with the financial covenants in the future depends on further debt reduction and achieving our forecasted operating results 
given the uncertain global economies  continued constraints in the credit markets  and other market uncertainties  there are various scenarios  including a reduction from forecasted operating results  under which we could violate our financial covenants in the second half of our failure to comply with such covenants or an assessment that we are likely to fail to comply with such covenants  could also lead us to seek an amendment to or a waiver of the financial covenants contained in our new credit agreement 
despite our present belief that we could obtain an amendment if necessary  we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain any amendments to or waivers of the covenants contained in our new credit agreement that we may request 
any such amendment to or waiver of the covenants would likely involve upfront fees  higher annual interest costs and other terms less favorable to us than those currently in our new credit agreement 
in the event our current lenders won t amend or waive the covenants  the debt would be due and we would need to seek alternative financing 
we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
if we were not able to secure alternative financing  this would have a material adverse impact on the company

see additional discussion at note  subsequent events 
our senior notes due contain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
among other restrictions  these covenants require us to meet specified financial tests  which include the following consolidated interest coverage ratio and consolidated total leverage ratio 
these covenants also limit  among other things  our ability to redeem or repurchase our debt  incur additional debt  make acquisitions  merge with other entities  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase capital stock  and create or become subject to liens 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december   and based upon our current plans and outlook  we believe we will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent months 
our debt position at various times increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions and results in a meaningful portion of our cash flow from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt 
this could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not subject to our control  such as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and regulatory factors 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  even after taking into account such new borrowings 
the revolving credit facility or other future facilities may be used for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  funding future acquisitions  and other investing and financing needs 
we believe that our available cash  revolving credit facility  cash generated from future operations  and access to public debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund our capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
management also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
our new credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests to comply with the terms of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the new credit agreement 
further  such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes due and could trigger cross default provisions in other agreements 
b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we do not believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our planned activities at this time 

table of contents c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
we do not presently believe that events covered by the risk factors applicable to our business could materially affect our credit ratings or could adversely affect our ability to raise short term or long term financing

this amount is not reduced for amounts the company would recover from repossessing and subsequent resale of collateral 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states  europe and asia 
the company has established the retirement plan committee the committee to manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts 
in conjunction with the enodis acquisition see note  and effective as of december   the company merged all but one of the former enodis us pension plans into the manitowoc us pension plan 
the unmerged plan continues to accrue benefits for the enrolled participants  while the remaining merged plans had benefit accruals frozen prior to the merger of the plans 
in  cash contributions to all pension plans by us were million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in financial risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited

interest rate risk in the fourth quarter of  we cancelled our two fixed to floating rate swap contracts which effectively converted million of our fixed rate senior notes due to variable rate debt 
these contracts were considered to be hedges against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt obligation 
at december   we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks related to fluctuations in interest rates which could negatively impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt or increase our interest cost related to our floating rate debt 
however  in january the company entered into new interest rate hedging transactions related to its term loan a and term loan b facilities 
these hedge transactions fixed the interest rate paid for percent of each of these facilities for a weighted average life of at least three years as required by the terms of the new credit agreement 
see additional discussion at note  subsequent events 
commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  copper  aluminum  and petroleum based products 
each of our business segments is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices 
we have established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices 
some of these programs are centralized across business segments  and others are specific to a business segment or business unit 
in addition to the regular negotiations of material prices with certain vendors  during we entered into certain commodity hedges that fix the price of certain of our key commodities utilized in the production of our foodservice product offerings 
at december   million net of tax of million of unrealized losses due to commodity hedging positions remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next months 
currency risk we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
international sales  including those sales that originated outside of the united states  were approximately of our total sales for  with the largest percentage being sales into various european countries 
regarding transactional foreign exchange risk  we enter into limited forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates between a budgeted rate and the rate realized at the time we recognize a particular purchase or sale transaction and reduce earnings and cash flow impact on nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments either impact our consolidated statements of operations in the period of the underlying purchase or sale transaction  or offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables being hedged 
the maturities of these forward exchange contracts coincide with either the underlying transaction date or the settlement date of the related cash inflow or outflow 
the hedges of anticipated transactions are designated as cash flow hedges and the hedges of accounts receivable and accounts payable are designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts hedging anticipated transactions and future settlements of outstanding accounts receivable and accounts payable with an aggregate fair market value of a liability of million 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december  for fair value hedges would not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations as any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging accounts receivable or payable balances would be offset by equal gains or losses on the underlying receivables or payables 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december  for cash flow hedges would not have a significant impact on the date of settlement due to the insignificant amounts of such hedges 
amounts invested in non us based subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year end 
results of operations are translated into us dollars at an average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  is million
