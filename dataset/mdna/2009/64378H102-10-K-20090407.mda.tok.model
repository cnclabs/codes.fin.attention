critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated from sales of flour and instant noodle 
all of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions 
we determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions after considering whether a contract exists  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the contract have been fulfilled and delivered 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
accounting for derivative instruments statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires all derivatives to be recorded on the company s balance sheet at fair value 
these derivatives  including embedded derivatives in the company s series a and b redeemable convertible preferred stock  are separately valued and accounted for on the company s balance sheet 
the pricing models the company uses for determining fair values of its derivatives are a combination of the black scholes and binomial pricing models 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates and option volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net earnings 
the company has obtained a valuation report from a valuation firm to support its estimates 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  eitf which requires freestanding contracts that are settled in a company s own stock  including common stock warrants  to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or a liability 
under the provisions of eitf  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value on a company s balance sheet  with any changes in fair value recorded in the company s results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no fair value adjustments are required 
the company has determined that the conversion features of its redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock are derivatives that the company is required to account for as if they were free standing instruments under us gaap 
the company has also determined that it is required to designate these derivatives as liabilities in its financial statements 
as a result  the company reports the value of these embedded derivatives as current liabilities on its balance sheet and reports changes in the value of these derivatives as non operating gains or losses on its statement of operations 
the value of the derivatives is required to be recalculated and resulting non operating gains or losses reflected in the statement of operations and resulting adjustments to the associated liability amounts reflected on the balance sheet on a quarterly basis  and is based on the market value of the company s common stock 
due to the nature of the required calculations and the large number of shares of the company s common stock involved in such calculations  changes in the company s common stock price may result in significant changes in the value of the derivatives and resulting gains and losses on the company s statement of operations 
the consolidated financial statements also reflect additional non operating gains and losses related to the classification of and accounting for the conversion features of the series a and b preferred stock and associated warrants  the amortization associated with the discount recorded with respect to the series a and b preferred stock as a preferred stock dividend  and the conversion features associated with the preferred stock issued by the company and associated warrants 
stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r for the fiscal year beginning on december   and recorded the compensation expense for all unvested stock options 
contractual joint ventures a contractual joint venture is an entity established between the company and another joint venture partner  with the rights and obligations of each party governed by a contract 
currently  the company has established three contractual joint ventures with three chinese partners in china  with percentage of ownership ranging from to 
pursuant to each chinese joint venture agreement  each chinese joint venture partner is entitled to receive a pre determined annual fee and is not responsible for any profit or loss  regardless of the ownership in the contractual joint venture 
in view of such contracted profit sharing arrangement  the three contractual joint ventures are regarded as owned by the company 
hence  the company s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the contractual joint ventures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our series a and b preferred stock creates a fluctuation risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on the price and volatility of our common stock and the time to expiration of the derivatives related to the conversion features and the warrants 
the determination of the change in the value of the derivatives requires the use of a complex valuation model and can fluctuate significantly between periods based on changes in the price of our shares and the time remaining in the life of the underlying financial instruments 
increase in our stock s market price increases the value of the derivative creating losses in our income statements and decreases in the stock s market price reduce the value of the derivatives creating gains in our income statements 
unless our share price significantly rises  the fair value of the derivatives will continue to reduce as shares of our preferred stock are converted 
the current derivatives outstanding relate to the preferred shares and expire by the end of currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk the majority of our operations are conducted in the prc except for some minor export business and limited overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in chinese renminbi 
hence  the effect of the fluctuations of the renminbi exchange rate relative to other currencies is considered minimal to our business operations 
however  we use the united states dollar for financial reporting purposes and therefore  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the renminbi and the u 
s dollar will result in increases or decreases in other comprehensive income or loss 
conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of renminbi  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that renminbi will not strengthen or devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the prc 
interest rate risk the company does not have significant interest rate risk  as our debt obligations are primarily short term in nature  with fixed interest rates 
our embedded derivatives liabilities are revalued each accounting period and their fair value can be affected by interest rate fluctuations based on changes in the risk free interest rate generally the interest rate on intermediate term obligations of the united states government 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk as most of our customers are long term customers with outstanding payment records 
our receivables are regularly monitored by our credit manager
