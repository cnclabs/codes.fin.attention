item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information elsewhere in this form k 
overview peco ii  inc was organized in for the purpose of acquiring the assets of itt s communications power product business 
today  we provide solutions to our telecommunications customers through a variety of products and services in order to meet their cost  quality  productivity and capacity challenges 
as part of this process  we design and manufacture communications specific power products 
we also provide on site e i  systems integration  installation  maintenance  and monitor services to our customers 
our power systems provide a primary supply of power to support the infrastructure of communications service providers  including local exchange carriers  long distance carriers  wireless service providers  internet service providers and broadband access providers 
our power distribution equipment directs this power to specific customer communications equipment 
our systems integration business provides complete built to order communications systems assembled and installed pursuant to customer specifications and incorporating other manufacturers products 
market conditions remain uncertain and difficult 
in the recent past  several of our customers have engaged in mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  such as sbc acquiring at t  at t acquiring bell south and cingular  alltel acquiring western wireless  and sprint acquiring nextel 
also  both sprint nextel and alltel spun off their local wireline businesses to focus on their core wireless businesses 
recently verizon has concluded its purchase of alltel  at t has announced its intention to acquire centennial  and century tel is planning to merge with embarq 
currently  major wireline companies are focusing their capital expenditure spending on fttc fiber to the curb and fttn fiber to the node for both broadband and video services distribution  while wireless companies are focusing their capital expenditure spending on migration of acquired systems to the standards of the acquiring carrier  integrating networks  improving are a coverage  deploying g data services and have begun to announce plans to deploy wimax and lte networks 
while the telecommunications market is extremely volatile  capital expenditure spending has expanded by the mid single digits in and analysts  given the economic uncertainty  are unsure regarding capital expenditure levels for the current economic environment is causing many companies to forecast a downturn in spending in the near future 
notwithstanding this possible slowdown  we believe that our capabilities  combined with our market position  will afford us the opportunity to take market share even in a slowing economy 
in  we targeted the capital expenditure growth in the wireless market 
we successfully ramped the midsized power products  which serve the wireless base station market  including both cabinet and hut applications 
the midsized product platforms are standardized at wireless operators 
we believe our market share grew in given the overall product business revenue growth year over year 
our r d investment extended beyond traditional cell site applications 
in june  we introduced our new small power platform at the nxtcomm trade show in las vegas 
the quantum power system positions us as a player in the shelf power market segment and the fast growing outside plant broadband market 
according to industry analyst skyline marketing  the size of this power market segment in the united states is estimated to be million in  reaching million by the quantum platform is a volt dc power system that combines high density rectifiers  distribution and control in a sleek  low profile shelf for optimized value to telecom carriers deploying fttn and traditional wireline architectures 
designed for the harsh outside plant environment  the quantum system s small footprint makes it ideal for cabinets where rack space is at a premium 
the quantum power system has several distinctive features that optimize the user experience 
our innovative quickload feature enables the technician to rapidly configure the system 
the system controller features a technician friendly input control device and a display that can easily be read in difficult outdoor conditions 
the rectifiers include our unique i view faceplate indicators that report rectifier current and load sharing status 
during the third quarter  we continued to develop features for the quantum power system 
new developments included additional distribution options and configurations that enabled the product to be deployed in more diverse applications 
first orders and subsequent installations for the quantum power system were received from a major wireline carrier 
the quantum system will be deployed in two applications to power different network elements 
additionally  systems were quoted to other customers during the third quarter 
lastly  we augmented our field sales team by adding a seasoned veteran in the tier ii and nontraditional service provider markets resulting in a marked increase in quoting opportunities over the last four weeks of the third quarter with the trend continuing into the first half of the fourth quarter 
we also introduced the high capacity hc bdfb battery distribution fuse bay in september the hc is a modular power distribution solution offering improvement in current capacity 
the hc features an industry leading amps per panel  enabling telecom power engineers to significantly lower the cost of powering and cabling new high power network elements such as routers  optical equipment and broadband delivery systems 
the hc also achieved nebs certification during the quarter 
during the third quarter  we achieved tl recertification 
the certification process included evaluation of our core business processes based on tl quality management system requirements release  an upgrade over previous assessments 
the tl standard defines the telecommunications quality system requirements for the design development  production  delivery  installation and maintenance of products and services 
our services group focused on hardening our solution portfolio to meet the power needs of our tier i customer base 
the revenue decline in was driven by reduced spending at two of our major customers 
during the fourth quarter of  we were notified of a contract renewal with a major tier i customer 
this renewal included a major expansion of work to be performed by us 
our services division continues to provide multi vendor engineering and installation services for all major power product brands 
this capability is both respected and valued in the marketplace 
our strong power e i services reputation has provided many opportunities for introducing new power products as well as a real user feedback channel on deployed products 
this feedback continues to aid us with designing and improving products to meet the industry evolving needs 
looking forward  we will continue to focus our efforts on delivering the service solutions our customers have come to expect from working with peco ii 
this dedication has enabled us to minimize customer turnover 
we will continue to expand our services footprint on those opportunities that make the best utilization of our current available resources  and or those that position us for success as our industry matures to the next level 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition product revenues are recognized when customer orders are completed and shipped  title passes to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales sometimes include multiple items including services such as installation 
in such instances  product revenue is not recognized until installation is complete and the product is made available for customer use 
services revenues on engineering and installation contracts and the costs for services performed are primarily recorded as the work progresses on a percentage of completion basis 
management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing sales 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which include intangible assets  goodwill  and plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following sustained underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the assets  their physical condition or the strategy for the company s overall business  negative industry or economic trends  declines in stock price of an investment for a sustained period  the company s market capitalization relative to net book value  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit  or a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  unanticipated competition  and a loss of key personnel 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
product and services goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indications arise 
during the fourth quarter of each year  the company performs the annual impairment test 
during  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to the product segment goodwill 
the impairment charge was due to the decline in the peco ii stock price in  combined with the continued weakness in carrier spending for the wireless segment  the product goodwill recognized as part of the delta acquisition is fully impaired 
during  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to the services segment goodwill 
the impairment charge was due to the continued weakness in carrier spending for the wireless segment  the services goodwill recognized as part of previous acquisitions is fully impaired 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
inventory costs consist of purchased product  internal and external manufacturing costs  and freight 
management regularly reviews inventory for obsolescence or excessive quantities and records an allowance accordingly 
various factors are considered in making this determination  including recent usage history  forecasted usage and market conditions 
we continually review the inventory for obsolescence or excessive quantities and accrue accordingly 
at a minimum  all part numbers are reviewed quarterly 
we identify potential obsolete or excess inventory by identifying parts with no usage for a year and excess parts greater than the last twelve month usage or two times future six month requirements  whichever is greater 
management reviews the inventory identified as potentially obsolete or excess to determine the appropriate allowance 
deferred taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the taxable entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
share based compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be different in the future 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items and the percentage of net sales from our consolidated statement of operations 
year ended december  net sales product services cost of goods sold product services asset impairments obsolete inventory write off gross margin operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill impairment of idle facility loss from operations interest income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was driven primarily by taking market share in the wireless cell site market 
the lead times that customers require to deliver product to meet their needs is being shortened 
the company focuses its responsiveness capability on meeting these shortened intervals with a high degree of reliability 
we believe that the product revenue growth in is directly attributed to the execution of this strategy 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we were awarded new services work with a major service provider  which positions the services business for growth in net sales in our product segment increased by million  with the result being million for the year ended december  as compared to million for year ended december  this increase  as previously discussed  was primarily driven by taking market share with reliable responsiveness to delivery dates 
new products  defined as those sold within the first months of product introduction  accounted for of our total product revenues in as of december   our product backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  had decreased to million from million at december  net sales in our services segment decreased by million  resulting in million for year ended december  as compared with million for year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by one key customer s delayed rollout of its program as discussed in our first quarter form q 
as of december   our services backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  was million  or flat with the year ended december  gross margin 
gross margin dollars decreased to million in as compared to a million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in as compared to in this decrease included a charge of million for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
this charge resulted from the completion of our strategic outsourcing initiative combined with product rationalization of our legacy products 
adjusting for the obsolescence charges noted above  gross margins for were slightly better than the product gross margin decreased to million in as compared to million in product gross margin  as a percentage of product sales  decreased to in  compared to in  which included the impacts of the obsolescence charges noted above 
the services segment gross margin decreased to million in as compared with the million in services gross margin as a percentage of services sales was in as compared to in this decrease reflected the impact of the first quarter revenue decline incurred as a result of one key customer s delay in its rollout of its program 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense increased slightly to million in from million in  representing an increase of million 
as a percentage of net product sales  research  development and engineering expense decreased to in from in the decrease  as a percentage of revenues  reflected productivity increases realized as we continued our focus on process improvements throughout the business 
the increase in overall spend was primarily attributed to the cost of bringing our new small power products to the market 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense remained flat at as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to in from in the decrease  as a percentage of revenues  reflected the productivity increases realized as we continued our focus on process improvements throughout the business 
interest income 
interest income  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in of this amount  interest expense was thousand in compared to thousand in  while interest income decreased to thousand in compared to thousand in the decrease in interest income  net  in the current year was due primarily to less income from investments from reduced interest earning balances and reductions of effective interest rates 
income taxes 
as a result of our significant continued operating losses in recent years  we have not been subject to significant income taxes and have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
as such  our effective income tax rate was a negative in compared to an effective rate of negative in liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs for the foreseeable future will be for working capital and operations 
as of december   available cash and cash equivalents approximated million 
based on available funds and current plans  we believe that our available cash  borrowings and amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next months 
the assumptions underlying this belief include  among other things  that there will be no material adverse developments in the business or market in general 
there can be no assurances however that those assumed events will occur 
if management s plans are not achieved  there may be further negative effects on the results of operations and cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
working capital was million at december   which represented a working capital ratio of to  compared to million at december  our investment in inventories and accounts receivables was million and million at december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
our budgeted capital expenditures for are million as we remain focused on conserving cash 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at days at december   as compared to days at december  the improvement in accounts receivable days sales outstanding was primarily the result of more customers taking advantage of discounts  which increased as a percent of sales over another factor was that more invoicing and payments we re processed electronically  which increases the time to process and pay 
at december   inventory days on hand  which represents gross inventory excluding impairments or reserves  was days  as compared to days on hand at december  the company has invested in certain tools to assist in forecasting levels of required inventory to meet its customer requirements 
these tools were implemented throughout and have resulted in a significant reduction in required inventory 
cash flows used for operating activities were million in  compared to which had cash flows provided by operating activities of thousand 
this was primarily from the net loss  an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities  offset by reductions in inventory and other non cash charges 
there was thousand of cash used for investing activities  which was primarily from the issuance of the note receivable  offset by the sale of equipment sold as a result of outsourcing 
cash provided by financing activities was million 
we have an available line of credit agreement with national city bank for borrowing up to million 
the line of credit requires certain amounts be restricted in an identified collateral account based on the outstanding balance due 
as of december   there is an outstanding balance of on the line of credit 
as such  the portion of the deposit account collateralized is reflected as restricted cash in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  we believe that cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash flow from operations  and our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we do not currently plan to pay dividends 
from february   to may   we had not been in compliance with the nasdaq stock market s marketplace rule c  which requires the company to maintain a per share minimum bid price 
in an effort to regain compliance  our shareholders approved  and on may   we executed  a for reverse stock split 
on may   we received a decision that nasdaq would continue the listing of our common shares on the nasdaq stock market 
although our common shares are currently in compliance with the nasdaq stock market s continued listing standards  we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet all continued listing standards in the future 
we have operating leases covering certain office facilities  and equipment that expire at various dates through future minimum annual lease payments required during the years ending in through under non cancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one year are thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively
