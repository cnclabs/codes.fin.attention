item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
industry background the commercial real estate industry encompasses real estate asset types such as office  industrial  retail  multi family  hotel  storage and land for development 
according to pramerica real estate investors  the aggregate value of commercial real estate in the united states was approximately trillion in much like the residential real estate industry  the commercial real estate industry relies primarily on brokers and agents who facilitate sales and leasing transactions for a commission 
according to cb richard ellis  the commercial real estate services industry in the united states generated approximately billion in services revenue in this brokerage system is highly fragmented and  according to cb richard ellis  the top five 
table of contents commercial real estate brokerage firms accounted for less than of the revenue generated by the commercial real estate services industry in in most cases  commercial real estate agents associated with both small and large brokerage firms operate as independent contractors  make decisions for property marketing strategies  and seek cost effective means to market their property listings 
we believe that the majority of transactions in the industry are small and are consummated by local independent brokers 
according to the association of real estate license law officials  there are over million licensed real estate professionals in the united states  including commercial and residential real estate agents 
in addition to the brokerage community  industry participants include tenants  owners  property investors and business operators  all of which are actively involved in commercial real estate transactions 
commercial office  industrial  and retail properties are often occupied by operating businesses  which are generally either rent paying tenants or owners of those properties 
according to the small business administration  in there were approximately million operating businesses classified as employers and there were another million operating businesses which were classified as non employers  such as small family owned and operated businesses 
we also believe that there are a large number of private investors who actively participate in commercial real estate transactions 
the traditional processes for marketing and searching for commercial real estate are inefficient 
traditionally  agents working on behalf of commercial real estate sellers and landlords market their property listings through methods such as word of mouth in the brokerage community  signage placed directly on buildings for sale or with space for lease  availability lists that are printed and shared among brokerage firms  advertisements placed in print media including newspapers and other publications  direct mail campaigns and emails sent to private distribution lists 
similarly  the process of searching for properties available for sale or for lease has been inefficient 
unlike the residential real estate industry  which is served by local multiple listing services or other central local databases of residential real properties available for sale  there has not been an equivalent listing service in the commercial real estate or operating business for sale industries 
as a result  compiling a comprehensive and reliable collection of current for sale or for lease property listings has been a slow and expensive process for individual commercial real estate participants  requiring significant resources and often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete information 
the loopnet model we provide an online marketplace that efficiently connects commercial real estate supply and demand 
our marketplace enables agents working on behalf of commercial real estate owners and landlords to list properties for sale or for lease 
we provide tools that allow property listers to proactively contact potential buyers and tenants seeking specific types of properties 
similarly  we enable commercial real estate agents  buyers and tenants to search for available property listings that meet their criteria  such as price range  location  building size and property type 
individuals that search for and find properties that meet their requirements on our marketplace are able to contact and connect with the listing party and initiate a commercial real estate transaction such as a property purchase or lease 
we offer property searchers access to a large number of available property listings that would be difficult and costly to compile through traditional means 
we also enable property listers to cost effectively reach a large number of buyers and tenants 
we believe that the loopnet online marketplace enables our members to initiate and complete more commercial real estate transactions more cost effectively than through other means 
the key attributes of our business model include leading commercial real estate online marketplace 
we believe we have aggregated a critical mass of commercial real estate agents  property owners  landlords  buyers  tenants and for sale or for lease property listings 
as a result  we believe that we are the leading online commercial real estate marketplace 
as of december   we had more than million registered members and more than  premium members 
for the year ended december   our registered members viewed property profiles on our website approximately million times 
we believe that this critical mass of commercial real estate industry participants and properties listed for sale or for lease creates a cycle that helps us to continue to grow our 
table of contents member base and expand our online marketplace 
commercial real estate agents  property owners and landlords are attracted to loopnet as a result of the large number of potential buyers and tenants  who in turn are attracted to our marketplace by the broad selection of properties listed on our marketplace 
comprehensive member generated content offering 
the majority of our property listings are submitted by our members through our website  using our online tools 
we enable members to provide detailed content on a property listing including description  financial and tenant information  photographs and key property characteristics 
we automatically compile this content into an interactive property profile that is available to our members when they search for properties on our website 
we believe that the content provided in our property profiles is more comprehensive  up to date and useful than the information provided in traditional commercial real estate property listings  such as newspaper and magazine ads or property signs 
in addition  we believe that using member generated property listings has allowed us to grow our online marketplace more efficiently and cost effectively than if we had compiled the listings on our own 
compelling member experience 
our marketplace is accessible at any time and we believe it is an intuitive  easy to use online service 
upon registering as a member  an owner or agent working for the owner can list properties on the service  and buyers and tenants can search for property listings quickly and easily 
properties are searchable immediately upon listing by our members 
basic members can list and search the properties for free 
our members can sign up to receive an email with updated listings that meet their criteria on a daily or weekly basis 
we also offer several online tools that facilitate the communication between parties who are seeking to make a commercial real estate transaction 
for example  a premium member that has listed a property can use our prospectlist feature to email other members who have searched for similar properties on our website 
members searching for properties are able to use our myloopnet feature to store multiple property profiles online to better organize their search process and find the property that is right for them 
to assist members further  we offer member support via email and phone 
in addition to our loopnet marketplace  we provide bizbuysell  an online marketplace that enables business owners  sellers and brokers to list and search for operating businesses for sale 
we believe that the operating business market is complementary in several ways to the commercial real estate market 
in many cases  owners or brokers who are seeking to sell a business are also selling the commercial real estate associated with the business  and business owners are active participants in the commercial real estate market as both buyers and tenants 
in addition  many commercial real estate agents also function as business brokers 
we believe that bizbuysell benefits operating business owners  sellers and brokers by providing an efficient online marketplace to connect and initiate transactions 
the loopnet advantage we developed our marketplace to address the needs of commercial real estate agents and the property owners  landlords  buyers and tenants they represent 
benefits to property listers broad marketing exposure 
our online marketplace offers commercial real estate agents and the owners and landlords they represent an efficient way to market properties available for sale or for lease 
properties listed on our website gain exposure to our large audience of members who are interested in commercial real estate opportunities 
the size and geographic breadth of our marketplace and member base enables property listers to realize marketing benefits for listings on both a local and national level 
we believe that the marketing exposure provided by a property listing on our marketplace is superior to traditional commercial real estate marketing methods  such as newspapers ads and newsletters  and enables our members to complete more sale and lease transactions in a more efficient manner 
cost effective and measurable marketing method 
we believe that the loopnet online marketplace is more cost effective and accountable than traditional methods for marketing commercial real estate properties 
premium members are able to use our reporting tools to track and monitor the marketing exposure of their property listings and receive a marketing statistics email that indicates the number of times a property profile has been viewed 
we 
table of contents believe that the low cost of a monthly premium membership and the features and measurability of our product offering is superior to commercial real estate marketing alternatives 
detailed and up to date property listing information 
our marketplace allows our members to provide significantly more information on a real time basis than they typically can provide using traditional commercial real estate marketing methods 
for example  when submitting a property listing  a member may choose to include files containing detailed financial spreadsheets  descriptive brochures or hyperlinks to other information 
we offer a set of online tools and services that facilitate the submission and verification of commercial real estate property listing information  and we provide additional information relating to the property such as detailed location and demographic data and aerial and satellite imagery 
in addition  our online marketplace enables members to update their property listings 
these updates are immediately available on our marketplace  ensuring that the property listings provide the most comprehensive and timely information 
benefits to property searchers access to a large number of property listings 
our online marketplace contained approximately  property listings as of december   primarily from the united states and canada 
the listings in our marketplace include all major asset types  such as office  industrial  retail  land and multi family properties of all sizes 
we believe that the depth and breadth of our property listings make our online marketplace valuable to commercial real estate agents as well as property buyers and tenants 
real time  comprehensive information 
our online marketplace provides access to comprehensive content on commercial real estate properties available for sale or for lease 
our online property listings provide more information than is available through traditional methods such as print or fax 
we are able to provide immediate updates on revised and new property listings on our website to our members 
we also provide premium members with daily email alerts with new property listings that meet their specified criteria 
in addition  through our recentsales product  members can access historical sale transaction information from the loopnet marketplace and third party information service providers to inform their analysis and decision process 
customized search engine 
we have designed our online marketplace to be easy to use and navigate 
commercial real estate agents  buyers and tenants use our proprietary commercial real estate search engine to quickly find properties in our marketplace that meet their criteria 
members can search based on a number of commercial real estate industry specific variables including property type and sub type  location  size  price range and key word 
we believe that offering a customized search engine makes our website easier to use for our members and allows them to derive more value from our online marketplace 
our strategy our objective is to enhance our position as the leading online marketplace for commercial real estate  operating businesses for sale  and related markets 
to achieve this objective  we are pursuing the following strategy expand our base of registered members 
we believe that growing our base of registered members increases the value of our online marketplace to the sources of both supply and demand for the commercial real estate market 
more property listings attract more individuals searching for properties  which in turn attracts more individuals seeking to list properties  making the loopnet marketplace more valuable for all of our members 
we intend to continue to grow our member base through focused marketing efforts to increase awareness of our online marketplace 
we acquire new members through word of mouth referrals  online and traditional marketing and direct marketing campaigns 
in addition  we plan to promote increased usage of the loopnet online marketplace by facilitating more property listings and searches by existing members 
as part of our efforts to increase our base of registered members  we offer free basic membership with limited functionality 
derive revenue from premium members 
we derive revenues primarily from premium memberships  so it is critical to our future growth that we convert basic members into premium members and grow our revenue per premium member 
we intend to grow our premium member base by increasing the number of basic members and then highlighting to them the value and benefits of premium membership 
we intend to grow our 
table of contents revenue per premium member by continuing to increase the value of the services we provide to our premium members  and to increase the fees paid by our premium members as we increase the value of the services provided 
we promote the premium offering to our basic members throughout our website  including at initial registration and when they list and search for properties 
we also plan on continuing to engage in targeted direct marketing to convert basic members into premium members 
offer complementary products and services 
our online marketplace produces a significant amount of information on commercial real estate transactions and property listings 
we intend to use the information provided by our online marketplace and from third party sources to identify additional  complementary products and services that we could in the future offer to help commercial real estate transaction participants research and make property decisions 
for example  in  we launched our recentsales product  an online service that provides sale transaction information based upon data collected from transactions initiated through our website and from third party information providers 
we intend to continue offering commercial real estate transaction participants complementary information services to improve their analysis  decision and marketing processes 
enhance the functionality of our marketplace 
we intend to continue to invest in improving our marketplace 
for example  in  we added our mapsearch feature that allows our members to use a dynamic aerial and satellite map interface to search for and view property listings  which we believe improves the property search and marketing process 
we will continue to enhance our product offering to grow our base of premium members and to increase the value of our online marketplace to our members 
expand into new markets 
we believe that there are opportunities to expand into new markets  although we have no current plans to do so 
we expanded into the operating business for sale market through our acquisition of bizbuysell  an online marketplace for operating businesses for sale  in october  we intend to identify and pursue appropriate opportunities in other markets that are related to the commercial real estate industry where we can apply our expertise in developing online marketplaces 
we may also pursue similar opportunities outside the united states 
we would consider expanding through either acquisitions or internal investments depending on opportunities and circumstances 
increase opportunities to advertise to our member base 
we intend to increase the advertising opportunities available to parties who are seeking to market products and services to our member base 
we believe that our large base of members is attractive to companies marketing to the commercial real estate industry 
for example  a commercial real estate lender may want to market a real estate loan program to an individual who is purchasing a property 
we plan on making additional sponsorship and lead generation advertising opportunities available to parties who are interested in marketing to our member base 
products and services our products and services facilitate the sale and lease of commercial real estate by enabling industry participants to list and find properties on our online marketplace and to contact and transact with one another 
through our online marketplace  commercial real estate agents working on behalf of sellers and landlords can list their properties for sale or for lease along with detailed qualitative descriptions  quantitative specifications  photographs and diagrams 
buyers and tenants of commercial real estate and their agents can perform highly targeted searches and review the property listings on our online marketplace

competition our market is competitive and fragmented 
although there is no one firm that competes with us in all of our service and product areas  we do face competition from separate sources with respect to our different product offerings 
because there is no comprehensive national commercial real estate listing service  the primary alternatives to our services are the traditional practices used by the commercial real estate industry 
these include print brochures created by listing agents that are mailed and distributed by hand  current availabilities lists printed and shared among brokerage firms  signage on properties  email brochures distributed to private distribution lists  word of 
table of contents mouth in the brokerage community  and newspaper advertisements 
we believe that these practices do not create an efficient mechanism to market  search or compare property listings locally or nationally 
we compete with costar  a provider of information and research services to the commercial real estate market 
some of the services that costar offers directly compete with our product offerings 
for example  costar provides commercial real estate for sale and for lease property listings which compete directly with our online commercial real estate marketplace 
several companies  such as property line international  have created online property listing services that compete with us 
these companies aggregate property listings obtained through various sources  including from commercial real estate agents 
in addition  newspapers include on their websites listings of commercial real estate for sale and for lease 
in the past  the national association of realtors or nar  its local boards of realtors  various affiliates  and other third parties have created commercial real estate information and listing services 
these services could provide commercial real estate for sale and for lease property listings  and transaction comparables  which compete directly with our online commercial real estate marketplace services 
companies such as ebay and craigslist  inc 
provide commercial real estate listing or advertising services in addition to a wide variety of other products or services 
ebay and craigslist operate real estate listing services which include commercial real estate and operating businesses 
other large internet companies  such as google  yahoo and microsoft  have classified listing services which could be used to market and search for commercial real estate property listings 
technology and infrastructure we have developed proprietary software that facilitates the listing and searching of commercial properties and businesses for sale or for lease on our marketplaces

risk factors 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem to be currently immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the stated risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the ongoing decline in the commercial real estate market and overall economy could negatively affect our revenues  expenses and operating results 
our business is sensitive to trends in the general economy and trends in commercial real estate markets  which are unpredictable and have recently experienced severe disruptions 
currently  the credit crisis and turbulence in the debt markets continue to affect the investment sales market  contributing to a significant slow down in our industry  which we anticipate will continue through these negative general economic conditions could further reduce the overall amount of sale and leasing activity in the commercial real estate industry  and hence the demand for our services 
conditions such as recent tightening in credit markets and negative trends in consumer confidence in global and domestic markets could also further dampen the general economy  and our business 
while we believe the increase in the number of distressed sales and resulting decrease in asset prices will eventually translate to greater market activity  the current overall reduction in sales transaction volume continues to impact our business 
therefore  our operating results  to the extent they reflect changes in the broader commercial real estate industry  
table of contents may be subject to significant fluctuations 
factors that are affecting and could further affect the commercial real estate industry include periods of economic slowdown or recession globally  in the united states or locally  inflation  flows of capital into or out of real estate investment in the united states or various regions of the united states  rates of unemployment  interest rates  the availability and cost of capital  wage and salary levels  or concerns about any of the foregoing 
we believe that the commercial real estate industry is composed of many submarkets  each of which is influenced differently  and often in opposite ways  by various economic factors 
we believe that commercial real estate submarkets can be differentiated based on factors such as geographic location  value of properties  whether properties are sold or leased  and other factors 
each such submarket may be affected differently by  among other things economic slowdown or recession  changes in levels of rent or appreciation of asset values  changing interest rates  tax and accounting policies  the availability and cost of capital  costs of construction  increased unemployment  lower consumer confidence  lower wage and salary levels  war  terrorist attacks or natural disasters  or the public perception that any of these conditions may occur 
for example  as of december   approximately of our premium members were based in california and approximately were based in florida 
negative conditions in these or other significant commercial real estate submarkets could disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations of their customers 
events such as a war or a significant terrorist attack are also likely to affect the general economy  and could cause a slowdown in the commercial real estate industry and therefore reduce utilization of our marketplace  which could reduce our revenue from premium members 
the occurrence of any of the events listed above could increase our need to make significant expenditures to continue to attract customers to our marketplace 
our business is largely based on a subscription model  and accordingly  any failure to increase the number of our customers or retain existing customers could cause our revenues to decline 
our customers include premium members of our loopnet marketplace  looplink users  users of our bizbuysell  cityfeet and landandfarm marketplaces  recentsales subscribers  reapplications users and advertising and lead generation customers 
most of our revenues are generated by subscription fees paid by our premium members 
our growth depends in large part on increasing the number of our free basic members and then converting 
table of contents them into paying premium members  as well as retaining existing premium members 
either category of members may decide not to continue to use our services in favor of alternate services or because of budgetary constraints or other reasons 
historically  the overall conversion ratio of premium members to basic members on loopnet has been approximately five percent  and our average monthly cancellation rate for premium members has ranged between three and five percent 
we believe that a decline in the fourth quarter of in our basic to premium conversion rate to approximately is attributable to an increasing proportion of principals ie  investors and tenants in our membership base  who convert to premium membership at a lower rate than the professional agents and brokers in the market  the impact of a slowdown in commercial real estate transaction activity and an approximately increase in the average subscription prices which we charge our premium members 
during the current quarter the commercial real estate credit markets experienced further tightening as a result of the subprime issues affecting the residential real estate credit markets 
in the fourth quarter of our cancellation rate exceeded our historical levels and we believe the increase is attributable to the credit tightening that the commercial real estate industry experienced and the increase in the average subscription prices which we charge our premium members 
if our existing members choose not to use our services  decrease their use of our services  or change from being premium members to basic members  or we are unable to attract new members  listings on our site could be reduced  search activity on our website could decline  the usefulness of our services could be diminished  and we could incur significant expenses and or experience declining revenues 
the value of our marketplace to our customers is dependent on increasing the number of property listings provided by and searches conducted by our members 
to grow our marketplace  we must convince prospective members to use our services 
prospective members may not be familiar with our services and may be accustomed to using traditional methods of listing  searching  marketing and advertising commercial real estate 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to acquire more members  in continuing to convert free basic members into paying premium members or that our future sales efforts in general will be effective 
further  it is difficult to estimate the total number of active commercial real estate agents  property owners  landlords  buyers and tenants in the united states during any given period 
as a result  we do not know the extent to which we have penetrated this market 
if we reach the point at which we have attempted to sell our services to a significant majority of commercial real estate transaction participants in the united states  we will need to seek additional products and markets in order to maintain our rate of growth of revenues and profitability 
we rely on our marketing efforts to generate new registered members 
if our marketing efforts are ineffective  we could fail to attract new registered members  which could reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace to current and potential customers and lead to a reduction in our revenues 
we believe that the attractiveness of our services and products to our current and potential customers increases as we attract additional members who provide additional property listings or conduct searches on our marketplace 
this is because an increase in the number of our members and the number of listings on our website increases the utility of our website and of its associated search  listing and marketing services 
in order to attract new registered members  we rely on our marketing efforts  such as word of mouth referrals  direct marketing  online and traditional advertising  sponsoring and attending local industry association events  and attending and exhibiting at industry trade shows and conferences 
there is no guarantee that our marketing efforts will be effective 
if we are unable to effectively market our products and services to new customers  or convert existing basic members into premium members  and we are not able to offset any decline in our rate of conversion of basic members to premium members with higher average subscription prices  our revenues and operating results could decline as a result of current premium members failing to renew their premium memberships and potential premium members failing to become premium members 
if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers  agents  and property owners  our marketplace could be less attractive to current or potential customers  which could result in a reduction in our revenues 
our success depends substantially on the number of commercial real estate property listings submitted by brokers  agents and property owners to our online marketplace 
the number of listings on our marketplace has grown from approximately  as of december   to approximately  as of december   
table of contents to approximately  as of december  if agents marketing large numbers of property listings  such as large brokers in key real estate markets  choose not to continue their listings with us  or choose to list them with a competitor  our website would be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants  thus resulting in cancelled premium memberships  failure to attract and retain new members  or failure to attract advertising and lead generation revenues 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors 
the market to provide listing  searching and marketing services to the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented  with limited barriers to entry 
our current or new competitors may adopt certain aspects of our business model  which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services 
all of the services which we provide to our customers  including property and business listing  searching  and marketing services  are provided separately or in combination to our current or potential customers by other companies that compete with us 
these companies  or new market entrants  will continue to compete with us 
listings in the commercial real estate industry are not marketed exclusively through any single channel  and accordingly our competition could aggregate a set of listings similar to ours 
increased competition could result in a reduction in our revenues or our rate of acquisition of new customers  or loss of existing customers or market share  any of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we compete with costar group  inc  a provider of information and research services to the commercial real estate market 
some of the services that costar offers directly compete with our product offering 
for example  costar provides commercial real estate for sale and for lease property listings which compete directly with our online commercial real estate marketplace 
costar also recently introduced a marketing service which will compete directly with our marketing services geared toward the general public 
several companies  such as property line international  inc  have created online property listing services that compete with us 
these companies aggregate property listings obtained through various sources  including from commercial real estate agents 
in addition  newspapers typically include on their websites listings of commercial real estate for sale and for lease 
if our current or potential customers choose to use these services rather than ours  demand for our services could decline 
additionally  the national association of realtors  or nar  its local boards of realtors  its various affiliates  and other third parties have in the past created  and they or others may in the future create  commercial real estate information and listing services 
these services could provide commercial real estate for sale and for lease property listings which compete directly with our online commercial real estate marketplace 
if they succeed in attracting a significant number of commercial real estate transaction participants  demand for our services may decrease 
large internet companies that have large user bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  such as ebay inc and craigslist  inc  provide commercial real estate listing or advertising services in addition to a wide variety of other products or services 
ebay and craigslist operate real estate listing services which include commercial real estate and operating businesses 
other large internet companies  such as google  yahoo and microsoft  have classified listing services which could be used to market and search for commercial real estate property listings 
competition by these companies could reduce demand for our services or require us to make additional expenditures  either of which could reduce our profitability 
our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations that may cause our stock price to decline  and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality  each of which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues  expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
our revenues  expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to factors including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k rates of member adoption and retention  changes in our pricing strategy and timing of changes  
table of contents changes in our marketing or other corporate strategies  our introduction of new products and services or changes to existing products and services  the amount and timing of our operating expenses and capital expenditures  the amount and timing of non cash stock based charges  the amount and timing of litigation related expenses  costs related to acquisitions of businesses or technologies  and other factors outside of our control 
our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the commercial real estate industry 
the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods  particularly slow downs during the end of year holiday period  and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods  could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period 
for example  we have historically experienced a significant decline in the rate of growth of both new memberships and revenues during the fourth quarter 
these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question and or future periods or cause our stock price to decline 
if we are unable to introduce new or upgraded services or products that our customers recognize as valuable  we may fail to attract new customers or retain existing customers 
our efforts to develop new and upgraded products and services could require us to incur significant costs 
to continue to attract new members to our online marketplace  we may need to continue to introduce new products or services 
we may choose to develop new products and services independently or choose to license or otherwise integrate content and data from third parties 
for example  in early we introduced our recentsales product and aerial imagery mapsearch feature to address perceived customer needs and to add additional searching enhancements  both of which utilize content and technology licensed from third parties 
the introduction of these improvements imposed costs on our business and required the use of our resources  and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to access these technologies and content on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if customers or potential customers do not recognize the value of our new services or enhancements to existing services  they might choose not to become premium members or to otherwise utilize our marketplace 
developing and delivering these new or upgraded services or products may impose costs and require the attention of our product and technology department and management 
this process is costly  and we may experience difficulties in developing and delivering these new or upgraded services or products 
in addition  successfully launching and selling a new service or product will require the use of our sales and marketing resources 
efforts to enhance and improve the ease of use  responsiveness  functionality and features of our existing products and services have inherent risks  and we may not be able to manage these product developments and enhancements successfully 
if we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded services or products  then our customers may choose not to use our products or services 
we could face liability for information on our website or general litigation claims 
we provide information on our website  including commercial real estate listings  that is submitted by our customers and third parties 
we also allow third parties to advertise their products and services on our website and include links to third party websites 
we could be exposed to liability with respect to this information 
customers could assert that information concerning them on our website contains errors or omissions and third parties could seek damages for losses incurred if they rely upon incorrect information provided by our customers or advertisers 
we could also be subject to claims that the persons posting information on our website do not have the right to post such information or are infringing the rights of third parties 
for example  in costar sued us  claiming that we had directly and indirectly infringed their copyrights in photographs by permitting our members to post those photographs on our website 
although the court issued rulings that were favorable to us in that litigation  other 
table of contents persons might assert similar or other claims in the future 
among other things  we might be subject to claims that by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties  we would be liable for wrongful actions by the third parties operating those websites 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these claims may increase as our business expands and our company grows larger 
any claims or actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  and result in the diversion of significant operational resources 
the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  allows copyright owners to obtain subpoenas compelling disclosure by an internet service provider of the names of customers of that internet service provider 
we have been served with such subpoenas in the past  and may in the future be served with additional such subpoenas 
compliance with subpoenas under the dmca may divert our resources  including the attention of our management  which could impede our ability to operate our business 
our potential liability for information on our websites or distributed by us to others could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our online marketplace to users 
our general liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
if we are unable to convince commercial real estate brokers and other commercial real estate professionals that our services and products are superior to traditional methods of listing  searching  and marketing commercial real estate  they could choose not to use our marketplace  which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses 
a primary source of new customers for us is the commercial real estate professional community 
many commercial real estate professionals are used to listing  searching and marketing real estate in traditional ways  such as through the distribution of print brochures  sharing of written lists  placing signs on properties  word of mouth  and newspaper advertisements 
commercial real estate professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt our products and services 
if we are not able to continue to persuade commercial real estate professionals of the efficacy of our products and services  they may choose not to use our marketplace  which could reduce our revenues 
in addition  we could be required to increase our marketing and other expenditures to continue our efforts to attract these potential customers 
our business depends on retaining and attracting capable management and operating personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract high quality management and operating personnel  including our chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  richard j 
boyle  jr  our president and chief operating officer  thomas byrne  our chief financial officer and senior vice president  finance and administration  brent stumme  our chief strategy officer and senior vice president  corporate development  jason greenman  and our chief technology officer and senior vice president  information technology  wayne warthen 
our business plan was developed in large part by our senior level officers  and its implementation requires their skills and knowledge 
we may not be able to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr 
boyle or other key officers or employees 
we have no employment agreements that prevent any of our key personnel from terminating their employment at any time  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
furthermore  our business requires skilled technical  management  product and technology  and sales and marketing personnel  who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers 
competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry  and the loss of a substantial number of qualified employees  or an inability to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of our activities  could harm our business 
to retain and attract key personnel  we use various measures  including an equity incentive program and incentive bonuses for key executive officers and other employees 
we have also entered into change of control severance agreements with our key executive officers  which provide  in part  certain severance benefits and 
table of contents acceleration of unvested equity awards if their employment is terminated in connection with a change of control of the company 
these measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we require to execute our business plan 
if we fail to protect confidential information against security breaches  or if our members or potential members are reluctant to use our marketplace because of privacy concerns  we might face additional costs  and activity in our marketplace could decline 
as part of our membership registration process  we collect  use and disclose personally identifiable information  including names  addresses  phone numbers  credit card numbers and email addresses 
our policies concerning the collection  use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites 
while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies  we could be subject to legal claims  government action or harm to our reputation if actual practices fail to comply or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with local  state or federal laws concerning personally identifiable information or if our policies are inadequate to protect the personally identifiable information that we collect 
concern among prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites could keep prospective customers from using our marketplace 
industry wide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites  including misappropriation of third party information  security breaches  or changes in industry standards  regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our website to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information  which could harm our business 
for example  in the first quarter of  our subsidiary  cityfeet 
com  was informed that there may have been a security breach to its credit card database and that some personally identifiable information of individuals contained in that database may have been misappropriated 
under california law and the laws of a number of other states  if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that unencrypted personal customer data has been stolen  we are required to inform any customers whose data was stolen  which could harm our reputation and business 
in addition  another california law requires businesses that maintain personal information about california residents in electronic databases to implement reasonable measures to keep that information secure 
our practice is to encrypt all personal information  but we do not know whether our current practice will continue to be deemed sufficient under the california law 
other states have enacted different and sometimes contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically 
compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of the different states is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours which collects personal information from customers in multiple jurisdictions 
another consequence of failure to comply is the possibility of adverse publicity and loss of consumer confidence were it known that we did not take adequate measures to assure the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information that our customers had given to us 
this could result in a loss of customers and revenue that could jeopardize our success 
while we intend to comply fully with all relevant laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in avoiding all potential liability or disruption of business in the event that we do not comply in every instance or in the event that the security of the customer data that we collect is compromised  regardless of whether our practices comply or not 
if we were required to pay any significant amount of money in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such laws  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  complying with the applicable notice requirements in the event of a security breach could result in significant costs 
our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of intellectual property rights infringement 
we may be subject to claims against us alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  including our competitors 
any intellectual property claims  regardless of merit  could be expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
for example  on or about april   real estate alliance ltd 
filed a lawsuit against the company and its subsidiary  cityfeet 
com 
table of contents inc  in the us district court for the central district of california  western division  alleging that the company and cityfeet 
com inc have infringed upon certain patents of real estate alliance ltd 
our technologies and content may not be able to withstand third party claims of infringement 
if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims  we might have to pay damages  stop using the technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights  seek a license for the infringing technology or content  or develop alternative noninfringing technology or content 
licenses for the infringing technology or content may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  developing alternative noninfringing technology or content could require significant effort and expense 
if we cannot license or develop technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business  we may be forced to limit our service offerings 
any of these results could reduce our ability to compete effectively and harm our business 
our trademarks are important to our business 
other companies may own  obtain or claim trademarks that could prevent  limit or interfere with our use of trademarks 
if we were unable to use our trademarks  we would need to devote substantial resources toward developing different brand identities 
if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property  our business  competitive position and operating results could be harmed 
the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property  and our intellectual property rights  including existing and future trademarks  trade secrets  and copyrights  are and will continue to be valuable and important assets of our business 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect the content of our databases and our other intellectual property 
we have taken measures to protect our intellectual property  such as requiring our employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements 
we also have taken action  and in the future may take additional action  against competitors or other parties who we believe to be infringing our intellectual property 
for example  on november  the company filed a lawsuit against costar group  inc and costar realty information  inc in the superior court for the state of california  county of los angeles  asserting claims for breach of contract and unfair business practices arising out of costar s alleged unlawful use of data from the company s web site for competitive purposes 
we may in the future find it necessary to assert claims regarding our intellectual property 
these measures may not be sufficient or effective to protect our intellectual property 
these measures could also be expensive and could significantly divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
we also rely on laws  including those regarding patents  copyrights  and trade secrets  to protect our intellectual property rights 
current laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property or our databases and the data contained in them 
in addition  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving  and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could require us to develop alternative intellectual property  incur licensing or other expenses  or limit our product and service offerings 
if we are not able to successfully identify or integrate acquisitions  our management s attention could be diverted  and efforts to integrate acquisitions could consume significant resources 
we have made recent acquisitions of  and investments in  other companies  and we may in the future further expand our markets and services in part through additional acquisitions of  or investments in  other complementary businesses  services  databases and technologies 
for example  in october   we acquired bizbuysell  an online marketplace for operating businesses for sale  in june   we acquired a minority position in xceligent  inc  in august   we acquired cityfeet 
com inc  in april   we acquired reapplications  inc  and in july   we acquired landandfarm 
com 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful 
the successful execution of any acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate such acquisitions and  if necessary  obtain satisfactory debt or equity 
table of contents financing to fund those acquisitions 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could harm our business 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from the normal daily operations of our business  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses  entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions  dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  reduction or replacement of the sales of existing services by sales of products or services from acquired lines of business  responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses  inability to maintain our internal standards  controls  procedures and policies  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
we may also incur costs  and divert our management s attention from our business  by pursuing potential acquisitions or other investments which are never consummated 
although we undertake a due diligence investigation of each business that we acquire  there may be liabilities of the acquired companies that we fail to or are unable to discover during the due diligence investigation and for which we  as a successor owner  may be responsible 
in connection with acquisitions  we generally seek to minimize the impact of these types of potential liabilities through indemnities and warranties from the seller  which may in some instances be supported by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price 
however  these indemnities and warranties  if obtained  may not fully cover the liabilities due to limitations in scope  amount or duration  financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor or other reasons 
in addition  if we finance or otherwise complete acquisitions or other investments by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted 
we may be unable to effectively manage our growth 
as our operations have expanded  and as the result of acquisitions of other companies  we have experienced rapid growth in our headcount 
our overall employee base has grown from employees as of december  to employees as of december  if we do not effectively manage our growth  our customer service and responsiveness could suffer and our costs could increase  which could harm our brand  increase our expenses  and reduce our profitability 
restructuring costs could also be required if we do not effectively manage our growth 
unless we develop  maintain and protect our brand identity  our business may not grow and our financial results may suffer 
in an effort to obtain additional registered members and increase use of our online marketplace by commercial real estate transaction participants  we intend to continue to pursue a strategy of enhancing our brand both through online advertising and through traditional print media 
these efforts can involve significant expense and may not have a material positive impact on our brand identity 
in addition  maintaining our brand will depend on our ability to provide products and services that are perceived as being high value  which we may not be able to implement successfully 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand  our ability to attract and retain customers or successfully expand our operations will be harmed 

table of contents changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies 
in the first quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
prior to sfas r we disclosed the pro forma effects of sfas under the minimum value method 
we adopted sfas r effective january   prospectively for new equity awards issued subsequent to january  as a result of sfas r  we may choose to reduce our reliance on stock options as a compensation tool 
if we reduce our use of stock options and do not adopt other forms of compensation  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we do not reduce our reliance on stock options  our operating expenses would increase 
we currently rely on stock options to retain existing employees and attract new employees 
although we believe that our accounting practices are consistent with current accounting pronouncements  changes to or interpretations of accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to adversely revise how our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or equity research analysts  our market price may decline and we may be subject to class action litigation 
it is possible that in the future our operating results will not meet the expectations of investors or equity research analysts  causing the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  companies that have experienced decreases in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
a securities class action lawsuit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
if our website or our other services experience system failures  our customers may be dissatisfied and our operations could be impaired 
our business depends upon the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our website 
problems with our website could result in reduced demand for our services 
furthermore  the software underlying our services is complex and may contain undetected errors 
despite testing  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in our software 
any errors could result in adverse publicity  impaired use of our services  loss of revenues  cost increases or legal claims by customers 
additionally  our services substantially depend on systems provided by third parties  over whom we have little control 
interruptions in our services could result from the failure of data providers  telecommunications providers  or other third parties 
we depend on these third party providers of internet communication services to provide continuous and uninterrupted service 
we also depend on internet service providers that provide access to our services 
any disruption in the internet access provided by third party providers or any failure of third party providers to handle higher volumes of user traffic could harm our business 
our internal network infrastructure could be disrupted or penetrated  which could materially impact our ability to provide our services and our customers confidence in our services 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  most of which are located in redundant and independent systems in los angeles  california and san francisco  california 
in addition  our bizbuysell website is hosted at a co location facility in virginia 
while we believe that our systems are adequate to support our operations  our systems may be vulnerable to damage from break ins  unauthorized access  vandalism  fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
although we maintain insurance against fires  floods  and general business interruptions  the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case 
furthermore  any damage or disruption could materially impair or prohibit our ability to provide our services  which could significantly impact our business 
experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security from time to time 
for example  in the first quarter of  our subsidiary  cityfeet 
com  was informed that there may have been 
table of contents a security breach to its credit card database  and that some personally identifiable information of individuals contained in that database may have been misappropriated 
the potential breach has not affected any personally identifiable information with respect to loopnet members  which information is maintained on separate servers 
although we maintain a firewall  and will continue to enhance and review our databases to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions  a hacker who penetrates our network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
we also may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security 
in addition to purposeful security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation or to a material risk of loss 
any of these incidents could materially impact our ability to provide our services as well as materially impact the confidence of our customers in our services  either of which could significantly impact our business 
we may be subject to regulation of our advertising and customer solicitation or other newly adopted laws and regulations 
as part of our membership registration process  our customers agree to receive emails and other communications from us 
however  we may be subject to restrictions on our ability to communicate with our customers through email and phone calls 
several jurisdictions have proposed or adopted privacy related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited email or spam 
these laws may impose significant monetary penalties for violations 
for example  the can spam act of  or can spam  imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with sending commercial email 
key provisions of can spam have yet to be interpreted by the courts 
depending on how it is interpreted  can spam may impose burdens on our email marketing practices or services we offer or may offer 
although can spam is thought to have pre empted state laws governing unsolicited email  the effectiveness of that preemption is likely to be tested in court challenges 
if any of those challenges are successful  our business may also be subject to state laws and regulations that may further restrict our email marketing practices and the services we may offer 
the scope of those regulations is unpredictable 
compliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing different standards and requirements is very burdensome for an online business 
our business  like most online businesses  offers products and services to customers in multiple state jurisdictions 
our business efficiencies and economies of scale depend on generally uniform service offerings and uniform treatment of customers 
compliance requirements that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction impose an added cost to our business and increased liability for compliance deficiencies 
in addition  laws or regulations that could harm our business could be adopted  or reinterpreted so as to affect our activities  by the government of the united states  state governments  regulatory agencies or by foreign governments or agencies 
this could include  for example  laws regulating the source  content or form of information or listings provided on our websites  the information or services we provide or our transmissions over the internet 
violations or new interpretations of these laws or regulations may result in penalties or damage our reputation or could increase our costs or make our services less attractive 
an important aspect of the new internet focused laws is that where federal legislation is absent  states have begun to enact consumer protective laws of their own and these vary significantly from state to state 
thus  it is difficult for any company to be sufficiently aware of the requirements of all applicable state laws  and it is further difficult or impossible for any company to fully comply with their inconsistent standards and requirements 
in addition to the consequences that could result from violating one or another state s laws  the cost of attempting to comply will be considerable 
also  as our business grows to be world wide  we will be required to comply with the laws of foreign countries  and the costs of that compliance effort will be considerable 
our stock price may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the purchase price 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other things  the risk factors described in this section of this annual report on form k  and other factors beyond our control  such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 
furthermore  the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies  including ours 
these fluctuations often 
table of contents have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  and the current economic crisis  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors or imposing a majority voting standard  authorizing the board to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 
in addition  the provisions of section of the delaware general corporate law govern us 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 
these and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts  reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

overview we are a leading online marketplace for commercial real estate in the united states  based on the number of monthly unique visitors to our marketplace  which averaged approximately  unique visitors per month during  approximately  per month during and  as reported by comscore media metrix 
comscore media metrix defines a unique visitor as an individual who visited any content of a website  a category  a channel  or an application 
our online marketplace  available at www 
loopnet 
com  enables commercial real estate agents  working on behalf of property owners and landlords  to list properties for sale or for lease and submit detailed information on property listings including qualitative descriptions  financial and tenant information  photographs and key property characteristics in order to find a buyer or tenant 
we offer two types of memberships on the loopnet online marketplace 
basic membership is available free of charge  and enables members to experience some of the benefits of the loopnet offering  with limited functionality 
loopnet premium membership is available for a monthly subscription fee and provides enhanced marketing exposure for property listings and full access to loopnet property listings  as well as numerous other features 
the minimum term of a premium membership subscription is one month 
we believe that the key metrics that are material to an analysis of our business are the number of our registered members  the number of monthly unique visitors to our marketplace  the number of our premium members  the rate of conversion of our basic members to premium members  the average monthly subscription price paid by our premium members and the cancellation rate of our premium members 
we also believe that the number of listings on our marketplace and the number of property profiles viewed by our registered members are key metrics  as they affect the attractiveness of our website to current and potential customers 
our registered members have grown from approximately million as of december   to over million as of december   to over million as of december  the number of monthly unique visitors to our marketplace averaged  in and  in and our premium members were  as of december    as of december   and  as of december  historically  our average monthly rate of conversion of basic members to premium members has been approximately five percent  and our average monthly cancellation rate for premium members has ranged between three and five percent 
we believe that a decline in the fourth quarter of in our average monthly conversion rate to approximately is attributable to an increasing proportion of principals ie investors and tenants in our membership base  who convert to premium membership at a lower rate than the professional agents and brokers in the market  the impact of a slowdown in commercial real estate transaction activity  and an approximately increase in the average monthly subscription prices which we charge our premium members 
transaction activity in the commercial real estate market that we serve has slowed  due to deteriorating economic conditions and due to the credit crunch impacting the availability and cost of debt capital for real estate transactions 
in the fourth quarter of our cancellation rate exceeded our historical levels and we believe the increase is attributable to the credit tightening that the commercial real estate industry experienced  the slowdown in overall transaction activity in the industry  and the increase in the average subscription prices which we charge our premium members 
the average monthly subscription price paid by our premium members has increased from in the fourth quarter of  to in the fourth quarter of  to in the fourth quarter of premium membership fees have driven the majority of our growth in revenues since and were the source of approximately of our revenues in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in the number of listings on our marketplace has grown from approximately  as of december   to approximately  as of december   to approximately  as 
table of contents of december  the number of property profiles that were viewed by our registered members increased from million in to million in to million in our revenues and expenses our primary sources of revenues are loopnet premium membership fees  bizbuysell brokerworks membership fees and paid listings  advertising on  and lead generation from  our marketplaces  looplink product license fees  and loopnet recentsales membership fees 
our revenues have grown significantly in the past three years from million in  to million in and to million in we have been profitable and cash flow positive each quarter since the second quarter of the key factors influencing our growth in revenues are the increased adoption of our premium membership services by the commercial real estate industry  increases in the average monthly subscription price of our premium membership product  the increased adoption of out recentsales services by the commercial real estate industry  and our acquisition of bizbuysell in october   and the increased adoption of our services by the operating business for sale industry 
our ability to continue to grow our revenues will largely depend on our ability to expand the number of users of www 
loopnet 
com and www 
bizbuysell 
com and to convince those users to upgrade to our paid services  especially premium membership 
we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from customers that pay monthly fees for a suite of services to market and search for commercial real estate and operating businesses 
the fee for our loopnet premium membership averaged per month during the fourth quarter of the minimum term of a premium membership subscription is one month 
we also offer quarterly and annual memberships which are priced and discounted accordingly  and paid in advance for the subscription period 
a customer choosing to cancel a discounted annual or quarterly membership will receive a refund based on the number of months the membership was used and charging the customer at the monthly rate rather than at the discounted quarterly or annual rates 
we also license our looplink product to commercial real estate brokerage firms who pay a monthly  quarterly or annual fee 
for our brokerworks product at bizbuysell  we charge per month 
we also charge fees associated with marketing individual businesses listed on bizbuysell 
for our recentsales product  we charge per month or to for an individual transaction 
revenues from other sources include advertising and lead generation revenues from both our loopnet and bizbuysell marketplaces  which are recognized ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
advertising rates are dependent on the services provided and the placement of the advertisements 
to date  the duration of our advertising commitments has generally averaged two to three months 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for salespeople 
these expenses are categorized in our statements of operations based on each employee s principal function 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related 
table of contents disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  and of those policies  we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management 
accordingly  we believe the following policies are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from premium membership fees for our online marketplaces 
we recognize revenues  under the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for the majority of our revenues  payments for loopnet premium memberships  revenues are recognized immediately on a monthly basis as such accounts are charged 
payments that we receive in advance of services being rendered  such as advance payments on annual and quarterly subscriptions by our premium members  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period  plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately million for certain federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to the uncertainty of realization 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income  which will begin to expire in for federal and for state purposes  respectively 
under section of the internal revenue code  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited based upon changes in the percentage of our ownership 
as a result of prior ownership changes  we were limited to using million of net operating losses to offset taxable income in and estimate that we will be able to utilize approximately million in and each year thereafter until  million in and million each year thereafter until the difference between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate is primarily a function of the valuation allowance provided against the net deferred tax assets and permanent differences 
our future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors  such as changes in our valuation allowance  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from research and development credits  potential limitations on the use of federal and state net operating losses  and state taxes 
on january   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying fin at adoption  if any  is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents website development costs in march   the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for web site development costs  which addresses whether certain development costs should be capitalized or expensed 
because our current website development costs relate to routine maintenance and operating costs  we expense such costs as incurred 
stock based compensation in the first quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
prior to fas r we disclosed the pro forma effects of fas under the minimum value method 
we adopted sfas r effective january   prospectively for new equity awards issued subsequent to january  under sfas r we calculated the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes model were years for the expected term  for the expected volatility  for the risk free rate and for dividend yield for the twelve month period ending december  future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
the weighted average expected option term reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which was issued in march the sec subsequently issued sab in december extending the opportunity to use the simplified method 
the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
estimated volatility also reflects the application of sab interpretive guidance and  accordingly  incorporates historical volatility of similar public entities 
seasonality and cyclicality the commercial real estate market is influenced by annual seasonality factors  as well as by overall economic cycles 
the market is large and fragmented  and different segments of the industry are influenced differently by various factors 
broadly speaking  the commercial real estate industry has two major components tenants leasing space from owners or landlords  and the investment market for buying and selling properties 
we have experienced seasonality in our business in the past  and expect to continue to experience it in the future 
while individual geographic markets vary  commercial real estate transaction activity is fairly consistent throughout the year  with the exception of a slow down during the end of year holiday period 
the impact that this has had on our business is that the growth rate in the fourth quarter of each year  while positive  has been slower than in the first three quarters of each year 
we expect this pattern to continue 
the commercial real estate industry has historically experienced cyclicality 
the different segments of the industry  such as office  industrial  retail  multi family  and others  are influenced differently by different factors  and have historically moved through cycles with different timing 
the for lease and for sale components of the market also do not necessarily move on the same timing cycle 
during the second half of and the full year of  the commercial real estate credit markets experienced tightening as a result of the subprime issues affecting the residential real estate credit markets 
we believe the credit tightening caused our cancellation rates to exceed our historical levels during  as well as resulted in a lower conversion rate of basic members to premium members

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings 
sfas was effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of currently  we do not have any instruments eligible for election of the fair value option 
therefore  the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in short term  high quality  interest 
table of contents bearing securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points  the change in the fair market value of our short term investment would not be a material amount to our financial statements 
there have not been any material changes in the past year to our primary market risk exposures  or how these exposures are managed
