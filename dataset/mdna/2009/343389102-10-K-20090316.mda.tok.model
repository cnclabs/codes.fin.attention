basis of presentation certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to the current period presentation 
during the fourth quarter of  we discovered that depreciation and amortization expense that was directly related to the production of our revenue was recorded as an operating expense and not as a component of cost of revenue 
over the past three years as we have acquired companies in our drilling products segment  depreciation directly associated with the production of revenue has grown 
we have determined that the portion of this expense that relates directly to the production of related revenue should more appropriately be reflected in cost of revenue 
we have evaluated the reclassification in accordance with the guidance provided in sab no 
 materiality  and have determined that the reclassification is not material to any period 
a correction of the reclassification described above has no effect on any single line item contained within or on the company s consolidated balance sheet  consolidated statement of stockholders equity or consolidated statement of cash flows for the  and annual or interim periods 
the reclassification is between cost of revenue and operating expense  a correction of this reclassification would not have an overall effect on flotek s statement of income and comprehensive income  net income  earnings per share eps basic or diluted  income from operations  income before taxes or provision for income taxes for the same periods 
we have concluded that the reclassification would not have a material impact on depreciation and amortization and cost of revenues or gross margin on both a consolidated and segment basis  based upon our assessment 
if depreciation expense had been presented correctly consolidated gross margin would have been reduced by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation expense directly attributable to the generation of revenue was million for the year ended december  correspondingly  operating expenses would have been decreased by the same amounts in each of the periods  resulting in no change to operating income  net income or earnings per share as reported 
this reclassification had the largest impact on the drilling products segment  reducing that segment s gross margin and decreasing its operating expenses by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting in no change to reported segment income from operations 
all future reports including those issued at interim periods  will present depreciation directly associated with the production of revenue as a component of gross margin  including adjustments to quarterly data presented herein 
executive summary we are a global technology driven growth company serving the oil  gas  and mining industries by providing oilfield products  services and equipment 
we were incorporated in  currently trade on the nyse and our headquarters are located in houston  texas 
we operate in select domestic and international markets including the gulf coast  the southwest and the rocky mountains  northeastern and mid continental united states  canada  mexico  central america  south america  europe  africa and asia 
we market our products domestically and internationally in over countries 
the customers for our products and services include the major integrated oil and natural gas companies  independent oil and natural gas companies  pressure pumping service companies and state owned national oil companies 
our ability to compete in the oilfield services market is dependent on our ability to differentiate our products and services  provide superior quality and service  and maintain a competitive cost structure 
activity levels are driven primarily by current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig count  oil and gas production levels  and customer capital spending allocated for drilling and production 

table of contents our business is comprised of three reportable segments chemicals and logistics  drilling products and artificial lift 
we focus on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our chemicals and logistics and our drilling products segments  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our artificial lift and chemicals and logistics segments 
we believe that our product offerings and geographical presence throughout these three business segments provides us with diverse sources of cash flow 
each segment has its own technical expertise and a common commitment to provide its customers with competitively priced quality equipment and services 
the chemicals and logistics segment develops  manufactures and markets specialty chemicals used in oil and gas well cementing  stimulation  acidizing  drilling and production treatment 
additionally  the segment provides well cementing  bulk blending and transload services and transload facility management services 
the drilling products segment rents  inspects  manufactures and markets downhole drilling equipment for the energy  mining  water well and industrial drilling sectors 
the artificial lift segment manufactures and markets artificial lift equipment which includes the petrovalve line of rod pump components  electric submersible pumps  gas separators  valves and services to support coal bed methane production 
over the past three years  we have grown both organically and through strategic acquisitions and other investments of complementary or competing businesses in an effort to expand our product offering and geographic presence in key markets 
we continue to seek accretive acquisition or merger candidates in our core businesses to either decrease costs of providing products or add new products and customer base to diversify our market 
we strive to mitigate cyclical risk in the oilfield service sector by balancing our operations between onshore versus offshore  drilling versus production  rental tools versus service  domestic versus international  and natural gas versus crude oil 
the acquisitions we completed in  and included teledrift  inc teledrift  which designs and manufactures wireless survey and measurement while drilling  or mwd  tools  in february  sooner energy services  inc sooner  which develops  produces and distributes specialty chemical products and services for drilling and production of natural gas in august  a partnership interest in cavo drilling motors  ltd  co  cavo  which specializes in the rental  service and sale of high performance mud motors in january and the remaining partnership interest in november  triumph drilling tools  inc triumph  a drilling tool sales and rental provider in texas  new mexico  louisiana  oklahoma and arkansas  in january  the tangible assets and licensed rights to exercise the exclusive worldwide rights to a patented gas separator used in coal bed methane production in april  the assets of liftech  llc 
liftech  which markets and services electric submersible pumps and downhole gas water separators primarily to coal bed methane gas producers in june  and the assets of can ok oil field services  inc and stabilizer technology  inc collectively can ok a downhole oilfield tool company in january as progressed  early optimism of continuing growth in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity was dampened by growing evidence of weakening economic conditions that began to significantly weigh upon the energy markets in early october 
while such weakening did not prevent oil prices from ramping up steeply in july  the velocity of the subsequent reversal to under per barrel by the end of the year was 
table of contents supported by economic reports and forecasts that confirmed the majority of the oecd organization for economic co operation and development countries to be in recession by the end of the third quarter 
consequently  global oil demand forecasts for dropped from quarter to quarter and it became apparent that moderating oil demand growth in the non oecd economies would no longer be sufficient to offset a continuing three year demand decline within the oecd countries 
in the fourth quarter opec elected to cut production 
however  the time taken for these cuts to be felt in the market  and for the resultant increased spare capacity to be reabsorbed by future growth  was large enough for e p customers to cut investment 
this translated to lower demand and weaker prices for oilfield services in an increasing number of areas late in the fourth quarter 
the natural gas markets presented a similar picture 
while activity was initially maintained in the first part of the year  the developing recession in the latter part of led to lower industrial demand in the developed economies although commercial and residential demand was maintained 
in north america  supply increased in largely as a result of industry deployment of advanced drilling  production and completion technologies leading to higher gas production and consequently greater storage levels in spite of lower canadian imports and decreased lng liquified natural gas supplies 
consequently  more lng became available for other international importers and  as a result  the majority of the developed economies are well supplied for their needs 
within the united states  the world s largest natural gas market  this translated to reduced gas exploration and production investment with lower demand for oilfield services and consequent pressure on service pricing in a number of areas by the fourth quarter as the market price of natural gas fell 
in international markets however  increasing demand for natural gas in the developing economies led to sustained drilling activity with drilling rigs previously deployed on oil exploration and development moving to natural gas activity in some regions 
evidence of a softening in the oil  gas  and mining industry spending began to impact our results in november  particularly in our chemical sales to pumping companies 
late in the fourth quarter of we began to take actions to scale our business to cope with these factors by implementing various cost containment methods designed to reduce our fixed costs such as implementing an employee cap and reducing travel levels 
early in  we took actions to size the workforce  in certain divisions  to our expected near term work load resulting in headcount reductions  including contract employees and full and part time employees 
also in early  we began implementing a plan to consolidate various facilities to better leverage our fixed cost structure 
in conjunction with the current market downturn  we anticipate inventory levels will significantly decrease and we will work to take advantage of declining raw material prices to meet our customers demand for competitive pricing 
a summary of factors important to understanding our results for is provided below and further discussed in the narrative that follows this overview total company net loss was million and diluted loss per share of in compared to net income of million and diluted earnings per share of in we recorded a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets consisting of patents and customer lists the impairment 
excluding the effect of the impairment  adjusted net income for the full year would have been million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of per share  compared to net income of million and earnings per share of in diluted earnings loss per share for  and were  and  respectively 
excluding the effect of the impairment  adjusted diluted earnings per share were  and for  and  respectively 
total company revenue increased to million in  up compared to due to increased demand in all of our segments and the acquisition of teledrift 
revenues in the chemicals and logistics segment increased due to increased demand for our proprietary specialty chemicals  drilling products revenues increased mainly due to the addition of the teledrift mwd suite of products  and artificial lift revenues increased 
the revenue associated with teledrift is included in the drilling products segment from its date of acquisition in february 
table of contents total company gross margin as a percentage of revenue for remained flat with primarily due to the impact of higher margins from teledrift offsetting margin deteriorations in the chemical logistics segment and the rest of drilling products as we were unable to pass on all of the increased raw material costs to our customers during the year 
the impairment reflected in our financial statements caused us to be in non compliance with the minimum net worth covenant contained within our credit agreement the new credit agreement as of december  additionally  our forecasts indicated that we might violate the leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio in the new credit agreement in the next twelve months 
accordingly  on march   we entered into a second amendment to our new credit agreement dated march  the second amendment with our lenders that we believe will provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our needs in the foreseeable future and allow us to meet our amended covenants 
total company income loss from operations as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in this decrease is due to the impairment  increased administrative costs and depreciation and amortization costs associated with acquisitions 
these results are partially offset by a rapid reversal that occurred late in the year in response to the worsening economic climate in the united states and around the world 
the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in the latter part of has resulted in lower activity  higher inventories  and the belief that demand will erode further in as a result of a worldwide economic slowdown  and has led to rapid and substantial reductions in exploration and production expenditure 
at current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources such as heavy oil  tar sands  coal to liquids  or gas to liquids are not economic to develop 
in addition  margins will remain under pressure as customers seek lower prices for oilfield services and we  in turn seek price reductions from our suppliers 
our drilling products segment is tied closely to rig count and any significant reductions in rig count will have an adverse effect on our business 
despite these pressures we expect to maintain our market share through service quality and product innovation and competitive bundling of product offerings 
non cash impairment as a result of our annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded non cash charges of million to impair goodwill and million related primarily to the impairment of customer lists and patents 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of every year 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
testing of goodwill requires the use of a two step impairment test that identifies potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of an impairment loss to be recognized if any 
we began our process of testing goodwill by assessing our reporting segments and units 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
however  two or more components of an operating segment should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar  if none of its components is a reporting unit  or if it comprises only a single component 
based on our analysis  we determined that we have four reporting units chemicals and logistics  other drilling products  teledrift which is included in our drilling products segment and artificial lift 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a 
table of contents reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
based upon our assessment  we determined that a potential impairment existed for goodwill recorded in the other drilling products  teledrift and artificial lift reporting units 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  which is used to measure the amount of impairment loss compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to determining the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
accordingly  we assigned the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed that assignment process only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment and did not write up or write down a recognized asset or liability  nor did we recognize a previously unrecognized intangible asset as a result of this allocation process 
we determined that the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill for each of the three reporting units mentioned above and recognized an impairment loss equal to that excess 
the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value of a reporting unit may be estimated using a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure if that technique is consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
we choose to determine the value of our reporting units using the income approach due to a lack of current market transactions that could provide perspective to our analysis as a result of an inactive transaction market and our diverse peer group 
use of this income approach is dependent on forecasts and determination of a weighted average cost of capital 
we calculated the weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit considering various unit specific factors such as risk  size and borrowing costs in relation to our peer group 
factors that effected these calculations include broad economic drivers that were impacted beginning late in the fourth quarter of we adjusted our activities in the later stages of in an effort to address the impact these factors were having on our customers and lessen the adverse impact on our forecasted results 
given the general economic climate  we assessed our full year forecast compared to the base year used in our prior year goodwill test and looked to other indicators of then current market participant information 
early in the fourth quarter of  our stock price began to decline 
the changes in business conditions since that time are considered significant 
initial decisions from our fourth quarter business review included the closing of certain operating locations and the curtailing of capital expenditures throughout the company 
these changes  combined with the extreme volatility and related deepening economic crisis experienced during the fourth quarter  lower than expected full year operating results  continued recessionary projections for  lower rig count projection  and significant uncertainty about when the global economy will recover  have contributed to reduced projected cash flows and higher risk adjusted discount rates used in our current analysis compared to those used in our goodwill test for our projections include anticipated benefits from a re leveraging of sales when conditions improved 
we anticipate a continued challenging environment for followed by some recovery beginning in accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  relating to the following reporting units artificial lift  million  other drilling products  million and teledrift  million 
included in these impairment charges is goodwill resulting from and later acquisitions 
all of these acquired entities were integrated into their respective reporting units and their cash flows were aggregated with all other cash flows of the respective reporting unit in the determination of estimated fair value 
an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
that assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability 
a long lived asset shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
due to the significantly changing business conditions late in the fourth quarter of  we determined a test our long lived assets for potential impairment was appropriate 
we grouped our long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent and identifiable 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of our long lived asset included only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we considered various factors in making these estimates including whether other assets of the group would have been acquired by the entity without the asset  the level of investment that would be required to replace the asset  and the remaining useful life of the asset relative to other assets of the group 
based on this analysis we recorded an impairment loss related to our other intangible assets that totaled approximately million and primarily relates to customer lists and patents which were part of business acquisitions in and

table of contents results for compared to consolidated revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the same period in revenue increased in all three of our segments as we experienced organic growth greater than when compared to the previous year with the remainder of the growth coming from our acquisition of teledrift 
the organic revenue growth is primarily a result of an increase in overall sales volume  particularly of our proprietary specialty chemicals  tool rentals  service inspections and expansion of our mud motor fleet 
sales of our biodegradable green chemicals grew  to million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the same period in gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat between both periods at approximately  of revenues 
we actively managed our gross margin through targeted price increases and cost containment measures to offset increasing raw material prices throughout the year 
we continued to experience greater volumes within our higher margin chemicals and logistics segment and volumes related to the teledrift acquisition 
sales of our proprietary environmentally benign green chemicals which sell at higher margins made up of consolidated revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  taking into account current market conditions  we anticipate that we will continue to experience downward pressure on our margins throughout we intend to mitigate the effect of this pressure through management of our raw materials and other direct product costs 
gross margin is calculated as revenue less the corresponding cost of revenue  which includes depreciation expense directly associated with the generation of revenue 
we impaired the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets based on management s evaluation of the company s sustained low stock price and reduced market capitalization  macroeconomic factors impacting industry conditions  actual recent results and forecasted operating performance  as well as other factors 
we normally assess the carrying value of acquired goodwill and other assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of every year 
the company determined that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeded the estimated fair value of the various reporting units and  as a result  recorded an impairment of million at december  loss from operations was million for the year in compared to income from operations of million for the year in excluding the effect of the impairment  adjusted income from operations was million for the year in compared to income from operations of million for selling  general and administrative costs are not directly attributable to products sold or services rendered 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million during the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of teledrift and increased indirect personnel costs in all divisions as we shifted into the more people intensive rental and service business  expanded geographically and expanded our sales and corporate support staff 
professional fees increased due to higher administration and management costs  which were incurred to strengthen back office functions and internal controls 
depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  compared to million during the same period in the increase is due to higher depreciation associated with acquired assets and expanded capital expenditures 
research and development r d costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million during the same period in in we expanded our r d investments in the chemicals and logistics segment by approximately 
due to current market conditions we anticipate r d spending levels to remain consistent with current year levels at approximately of revenues 
r d expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  versus million in the increase was a result of the increase in our overall debt level associated with the issuance of the convertible 
table of contents senior notes in the amount of million used to finance the teledrift acquisition and pay down amounts previously outstanding under our senior credit facility 
additionally  we amortized debt fees related to our financing agreements throughout that amounted to approximately million 
further discussion related to these credit facilities can be found in the capital resources and liquidity discussion included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of our annual report on form k 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for was for the year ended december  versus for the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the impairment and a shift in income by jurisdiction 
the impairment had a million impact on our tax provision 
results for compared to consolidated revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the same period in revenue increased in all of our segments principally due to increased demand for our proprietary specialty chemicals  the completion of three acquisitions in  and the expansion of our rental tool fleet 
approximately of the revenue growth in over related to organic growth of our existing businesses 
gross margin for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the same period in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in the increase in gross profit is due to an increase in specialty chemical sales as a percentage of total sales overall 
chemicals and logistics made up approximately of total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  versus for the same period in in addition  sales of our proprietary environmentally benign green chemicals which sell at higher margins made up of the total chemicals and logistics revenues for the year ended december   versus for the same period in selling  general and administrative costs are not directly attributable to products sold or services rendered 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million during the same period in the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to increased indirect personnel costs in all divisions as we shifted into the more people intensive rental and service business  expanded geographically and expanded our sales and corporate support staff 
general and administrative expenses were higher due to increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley initiatives  computing systems upgrades conversions  and implementation of the rtms rental tool management system 
all of these administrative upgrades are expected to result in enhanced control and efficiency during in addition  million of equity compensation expense associated with restricted stock and option grants made to employees  directors  and officers  was incurred in which was not incurred in depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately compared to million during the same period in the increase is due to higher depreciation associated with acquired assets and increased capital expenditures 
in addition  amortization expense increased due to the recognition of intangible assets from acquisitions completed in and research and development r d costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of compared to million during the same period in the increase in r d related to the establishment of our specialty chemical research facility that opened in r d expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  versus million in the increase was a result of the increase in our overall debt level associated with the triumph  cavo and sooner 
table of contents acquisitions 
we amended our credit facility in january in conjunction with the triumph acquisition and again in august for the acquisition of sooner 
our borrowing capacity on the line of credit and equipment term loan was increased to partially fund these acquisitions 
a provision for income taxes of million was recorded for the year ended december  an effective tax rate of was applied for the year ended december  versus for the same period in the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the percentage of earnings in state jurisdictions with higher state income tax rates  and increased state income tax expense resulting from the enactment of the new texas margin tax in partially offsetting these factors is the increased tax benefit associated with us manufacturing operations under the american jobs creation act of results by segment chemicals and logistics for the years ended december  in thousands revenue income from operations income from operations results for compared to chemicals and logistics chemicals and logistics revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily a result of an increase in sales of our proprietary specialty chemicals and the sooner energy services  inc acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of the remainder of our chemical business as those products became commoditized due to increased competition 
we also instituted a price increase in the first quarter of that we maintained for most of the year 
however  in the second half of the year our margins declined as a result of rising raw material costs 
sales of our micro emulsion chemicals grew  to million for the year ended december  from million for as a result of increased fracturing activities and wider acceptance of our micro emulsion products by independent pressure pumping companies as well as the majors 
income from operations was million for the year ended december   approximately higher than the same period in income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  the rising cost of raw materials petroleum based feedstock reduced our operating profit 
we partially offset this cost increase through targeted price increases for certain products 
we also made investments related to a new research and development facility and for our international initiative 
as a result of the declining market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of  we began to institute measures to size the organization to the current marketplace 
we relocated one production chemical manufacturing facility 
as a technology driven company  we remained active in our research and development efforts by maintaining these costs at current levels as a percentage of revenues 
we anticipate increased price pressures from our customers within the marketplace and will therefore focus our attention on margin protection through management of both raw materials and fixed costs  in addition to technology innovations 
results for compared to chemicals and logistics chemical and logistics revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily a result of 
table of contents an increase in overall sales volume  particularly of our proprietary specialty chemicals 
the most significant revenue growth occurred in the mid continent  permian basin  rocky mountain and south texas regions 
sales of our biodegradable  environmentally benign green chemicals grew  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in on august   the company acquired sooner energy services to establish a platform for expansion into production chemicals 
sooner develops  produces and distributes specialty chemical products and services for the drilling and production of natural gas 
the sooner acquisition contributed approximately million in revenue in the company signed a five year agreement to build and operate a liquid chemical distribution facility for a major service company 
construction of our liquids chemical facility was completed during the fourth quarter of and is expected to double our throughput service revenue in the new liquid chemical distribution facility and our existing cement handling and blending facility will provide a broad range of blending and logistics services to our customer for cementing and stimulation products used offshore in the gulf of mexico 
income from operations increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in operating profit is driven by an increase in overall sales activity coupled with a continued shift in sales mix to higher margin patented and proprietary products 
early in  construction of a  square foot expansion to our production facilities was completed 
this facility tripled production capabilities and allows the division to manage larger volumes of inputs to take further advantage of volume pricing discounts

we made strategic investments in new north american sales facilities and opened two new repair facilities 
the drilling products segment requires higher levels of capital expenditures than our other segments 
capital expenditures in the current year were approximately million for the drilling segment compared to million in due to current market conditions that began to develop late in the year and limitations on capital expenditures included in our senior credit facility  as amended  we plan to reduce capital spending in this segment by more than in from levels 
our plan is designed to meet our maintenance capital requirements and provide opportunity to grow our business in the area of higher margin drilling jars and seal bearing motors as part of our strategic drilling products suite 
we anticipate rig count to continue to fall in continuing the trend we saw develop late in we are taking action to size the drilling products segment to the current marketplace through strategic actions that are focused on personnel and our fixed cost 
our actions are expected to provide us with the greatest flexibility to capitalize on the anticipated return to more normal market conditions in the near future 
pricing remains very competitive and we will aggressively defend our market share with competitive pricing and margin protection through technology bundling with commodities 
we intend to continue the initiative of replacing sub rented drilling jars and shock subs with higher margin proprietary tools 
additionally  we intend to continue to grow our presence in the international market through cavo mud motors and the teledrift line of mwd products including the telepulse mwd for horizontal drilling that is scheduled for introduction in results for compared to drilling products drilling products revenue for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  compared to million for the year ended december  growth in rentals and services associated with the acquisitions and the expansion of our mud motor fleet contributed significantly to the increase 
in january we acquired the assets of triumph drilling tools  a drilling tool sales and rental provider in texas  new mexico  louisiana  oklahoma and arkansas 
additionally  in january we acquired a interest and subsequently acquired the remaining interest in november in cavo drilling motors  which specializes in the rental  service and sale of high performance mud motors 
these acquisitions expanded machining  repair  tool rental and inspection service capability within our drilling products group 
these acquisitions contributed approximately million in revenue during

we opened two new repair facilities in north america to take advantage of market opportunities 
we designed these facilities to be scalable to local market conditions 
loss from operations was million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the previously discussed impairment charge 
an impairment of million relating to goodwill million and other intangible assets million was recorded related to this segment 
excluding the effect of the impairment  adjusted income from operations was million or approximately higher than income from operations of million in adjusted income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to for the year ended december  we made strategic investments in this segment by adding two new pump repair facilities and increased our field sales presence 
consistent with our strategy within our other two segments  we plan to reduce our operating cost structure to align with the current market conditions while maintaining flexibility that should allow us to capitalize on a return to a more normalized market 
in the first quarter of  we are closing one of our facilities in response to the dramatic decrease in our customers drilling activity in coal bed methane and related pricing pressures 
our strategy is to focus on competitive pricing and exceptional service by offering our proprietary downhole gas separator technology and petrovalve rod pump systems  especially in the international market 
results for compared to artificial lift artificial lift revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase compared to million for the same period in the increase in overall sales is due to the acquisition of two coal bed

income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of revenue is due to increased indirect personnel and travel costs  and an incremental million of depreciation and amortization associated with acquired assets 
capital resources and liquidity our on going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt  to acquire and maintain equipment  to fund our working capital requirements and to complete acquisitions 
we have funded our capital requirements with operating cash flows  debt borrowings  and by issuing shares of common stock

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
consolidation policy the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiary corporations  after elimination of all material intercompany accounts  transactions  and profits

acquisitions acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under sfas no 
accounting for business combinations 
the acquired companies results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions was based on the estimates of fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation within the one year anniversary of the acquisition 
we have not made any acquisitions under sfas r  business combinations as of december  inventories inventories consist of raw materials  finished goods and work in process 
finished goods inventories include raw materials  direct labor and production overhead 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method 
the company maintains a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventories  which is reviewed for adequacy on a periodic basis 
revenue recognition revenue for product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met i evidence of an agreement exists  ii products are shipped or services rendered to the customer and all significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and iv the collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable are recorded at that time net of any discounts 
earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of collectibility of the accounts receivable 
accounts receivable deemed ultimately uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
deposits and other funds received in advance of delivery are deferred until the transfer of ownership is complete 
our logistics division recognizes revenue of its design and construction oversight contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of completion 
this percentage is applied to the total estimated revenue at completion to calculate revenue earned to date 
contract costs include all direct labor and material costs and those indirect costs related to manufacturing and construction operations 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract bonus or penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which such revisions appear probable

depreciation or amortization is provided at rates considered sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets  net of estimated salvage value  using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives buildings and leasehold improvements years machinery  equipment and rental tools years furniture and fixtures years transportation equipment years computer equipment years we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds either the fair value or the estimated discounted cash flows of the assets  whichever is more readily measurable 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
research and development costs expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate price paid by us in acquisitions over the fair market value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
intangible and other assets separable intangible and other assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized on a straight line over their useful lives which range from to years impairment valuation we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of every year 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
testing of goodwill requires the use of a two step impairment test that identifies potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of an impairment loss to be recognized if any 
we began our process of testing goodwill by assessing our reporting segments and units 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
however  two or more components of an operating segment should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar  if none of its components is a reporting unit  or if it comprises only a single component 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the 
table of contents reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  is used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to determining the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
accordingly  we assigned the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed that assignment process only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment and did not write up or write down a recognized asset or liability  nor did we recognize a previously unrecognized intangible asset as a result of this allocation process 
we determined that the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill for each of the three reporting units mentioned above and recognized an impairment loss equal to that excess 
an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
that assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability 
a long lived asset shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
due to the significantly changing business conditions late in the fourth quarter of  we determined a test our long lived assets for potential impairment was appropriate 
based on our testing process  we recognized million of goodwill impairment charges and an additional charge of million related to the impairment of other intangible assets  primarily  customer lists and patents in while the value of goodwill and other intangible assets are substantially reduced  should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  or should our operating plans or business model change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 
current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in tax rates and changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect at year end 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to fasb interpretation

the company and its subsidiaries state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ending december  through it is our intention to permanently reinvest all of the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries in such subsidiaries 
accordingly  we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries 
if a distribution is made to us from the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
because we cannot predict when  if at all  we will make a distribution of these undistributed earnings  we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
fair value and financial instruments the company adopted fas as of january   except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities addressed in fasb staff position fas fsp fas  which defines fair value  establishes a frame work for measuring fair value and establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value 
the implementation of fas did not cause a change in the method of calculating fair value of assets and liabilities 
the primary impact from the adoption was additional disclosures 
fsp fas delayed the effective date of fas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement 
a financial asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
the company measures its convertible senior notes at fair value by utilizing quoted prices for similar liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the liability  either directly or indirectly through market corroboration  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument  market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas on january  fas  provides an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements 
as we did not elect to measure existing assets and liabilities at fair value  the adoption did not have an effect on our financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement on of the new term loan facility to partially reduce our exposure to interest rate risk as required by the senior credit agreement 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
while management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate  actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents significant trends  developments and uncertainties as progressed  early optimism of continuing growth in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity was dampened by growing evidence of weakening economic conditions that began to significantly impact the energy markets in early october 
while such weakening did not prevent oil prices from ramping up steeply to highs of approximately per barrel in july  the velocity of the subsequent reversal to under per barrel by the end of the year was supported by economic reports and forecasts that confirmed the majority of the oecd organization for economic co operation and development countries to be in recession by the end of the third quarter 
consequently  global oil demand forecasts for dropped from quarter to quarter and it became apparent that moderating oil demand growth in the non oecd economies would no longer be sufficient to offset a continuing three year demand decline within the oecd countries 
as a result  saw the first global oil demand decrease in years 
in the fourth quarter opec elected to cut production by a total of million barrels per day to remove supply and support prices 
however  the time taken for these cuts to be felt in the market  and for the resultant increased spare capacity to be reabsorbed by future growth  was large enough for e p customers to cut investment 
this translated to lower demand and weaker prices for oilfield services in an increasing number of areas late in the fourth quarter 
the natural gas markets presented a similar picture 
while activity was initially maintained in the first part of the year  the developing recession in the latter part of led to lower industrial demand in the developed economies although commercial and residential demand was maintained 
in north america  supply increased in largely as a result of industry deployment of advanced drilling  production and completion technologies leading to higher gas production and consequently greater storage levels in spite of lower canadian imports and decreased lng liquified natural gas supplies 
consequently  more lng became available for other international importers and  as a result  the majority of the developed economies are well supplied for their needs 
within the united states  the world s largest natural gas market  this translated to reduced gas exploration and production investment with lower demand for oilfield services and consequent pressure on service pricing in a number of areas by the fourth quarter as the market price of natural gas fell 
in international markets however  increasing demand for natural gas in the developing economies led to sustained drilling activity with drilling rigs previously deployed on oil exploration and development moving to natural gas activity in some regions 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession 
a slowdown in economic activity caused by a recession would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower oil and natural gas prices 
forecasted crude oil prices for have dropped substantially from the end of demand for our services and products depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices 
demand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development  and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  including national oil companies 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration  development  and production activity 
we therefore expect activity to weaken across the board  with the most significant declines occurring in north american gas drilling  russian oil production enhancement  and in mature offshore basins 
exploration offshore will also be somewhat curtailed but commitments already planned are likely to be honored 
furthermore  pricing erosion will compound these effects on revenue 
in this market we are taking the necessary actions early in to adjust our operating cost base while preserving our long term commitments to technology development  key skill sets and service and product quality 
the most important indicator of a future recovery in oilfield services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand for oil 
the recent years of increased exploration and production spending  however  have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation 
the age of the production base  accelerating decline 
table of contents rates and the smaller size of recently developed fields should mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will lead to a strong rebound in activity in the future 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
however  certain raw materials used by the chemical and logistics segment in the manufacture of our proprietary  green chemical sales are available from limited sources and disruptions to our suppliers could materially impact our sales 
the prices paid by the company for its raw materials may be affected by  among other things  energy  steel and other commodity prices  tariffs and duties on imported materials  foreign currency exchange rates  the general business cycle and global demand 
the company experienced greater difficulty in securing the necessary supplies of certain chemicals in than it experienced during the preceding several years 
during  the prices of many raw materials rose considerably  though towards the end of  we began to see prices decline 
we have not always been successful in passing on higher raw material costs to our customers and accordingly any significant changes in the prices of these raw materials may have a negative impact on our margins and income from operations 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles  but we do not consider our operations to be highly seasonal 
additionally  business cycles can impact our operations and financial position when compared to other periods 
on an overall basis  our operations are not generally affected by seasonality 
weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services 
examples of how such phenomena can impact our business include the severity and duration of the winter in north america can have a significant impact on gas storage levels and drilling activity for natural gas  the timing and duration of the spring thaw in canada directly affects activity levels due to road restrictions  hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore operations  in addition  due to higher spending near the end of the year by customers the results of operations of the chemical and logistics segment are generally stronger in the fourth quarter of the year than at the beginning of the year 
the results of operations of our artificial lift segment are generally weaker in the second quarter due to restrictions on drilling on federal lands due to the breeding season of certain bird species
