risk factors investing in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks and  as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
in addition to the risk factors discussed below  investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties presented under the following captions in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of part ii of this report reit conversion and factors influencing our results of operations and cash flows  both of which are incorporated herein by reference 
business and operating risks our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 
under the reit rules  to remain qualified as a reit  a reit must distribute  within a certain period after the end of each year  of its ordinary taxable income for such year 
we anticipate that our reit income in the foreseeable future will consist primarily of net capital gains resulting from payments to be received under timber cutting contracts with potlatch trs and third parties  and not ordinary taxable income 
therefore  unlike most reits  we may not be required to distribute material amounts of cash to remain qualified as a reit 
if  after giving effect to our distributions  we have not distributed an amount equal to form k 
table of contents of our ordinary taxable income and net capital gains income  then we would be required to pay tax on the undistributed portion of such taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
in this case  our stockholders could be required to include their proportionate share of any undistributed capital gain in income and would receive a credit or refund for their share of the tax paid by us 
the irs issued a ruling in december that provides temporary guidance allowing a publicly owned real estate investment trust to distribute up to of its dividends in the form of company stock 
pursuant to the guidance  the total value of the cash and stock is considered to be a distribution of current year taxable income when computing the reit s dividends paid deduction 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  will determine the actual amount of distributions to be made to stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions in our industry and in the markets for our products  tax considerations  borrowing capacity  debt covenant restrictions  timber prices and harvest levels on our timberlands 
our operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by the fluctuating nature of timber prices 
our results of operations and cash flows will be materially affected by the fluctuating nature of timber prices 
a variety of factors affect prices for timber  including factors affecting demand  such as changes in economic conditions  construction activity levels  interest rates  credit availability  population growth and weather conditions  as well as changes in timber supply and other factors 
all of these factors can vary by region  timber type saw logs or pulpwood logs and species 
in  the overall price per ton for our timber was down approximately from timber prices are also affected by changes in timber availability at the local and national level 
our timberland ownership is currently concentrated in arkansas  idaho  minnesota and wisconsin 
in arkansas and minnesota  most timberlands are privately owned 
historically  increases in timber prices have often resulted in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands  including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations  causing a short term increase in supply that has tended to moderate price increases 
decreases in timber prices have often resulted in lower harvesting activities  causing short term decreases in supply that has tended to moderate price decreases 
in idaho  where a greater proportion of timberland is government owned  any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government owned lands could significantly reduce timber prices  which could harm our results of operations 
for more than twenty five years  environmental concerns and other factors have limited timber sales by federal agencies  which historically had been major suppliers of timber to the united states forest products industry  particularly in the west 
any reversal of policy that substantially increases timber sales from government land could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
on a local level  timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local forest products industry participants  as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires 
the cyclical nature of our business could adversely affect our results of operations 
the financial performance of our operations is affected by the cyclical nature of our business 
the markets for timber  real estate and manufactured wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control 
the demand for our timber and wood products is affected by the level of new residential construction activity and  to a lesser extent  home repair and remodeling activity  which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions  interest rates  credit availability  population growth  weather conditions and other factors 
the demand for logs is also affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets 
the supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments  which then causes downward pressure on prices 
the demand for real estate can be affected by changes in factors such as potlatch corporation 
table of contents interest rates  credit availability and economic conditions  as well as by the impact of federal  state and local land use and environmental protection laws 
historical prices for our wood products have been volatile  and we  like others in the forest products industry  have limited direct influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products 
our ability to harvest and sell timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our timber harvest levels and sales may be limited due to weather conditions  timber growth cycles  restrictions on access  availability of contract loggers and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources  as well as by other factors  including damage by fire  insect infestation  disease and natural disasters such as ice storms  wind storms  hurricanes and floods 
although damage from such natural causes usually is localized  affecting only a limited percentage of our timber  there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will be limited 
our financial results and cash flows are dependent to a significant extent on our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels 
changes in harvest levels on our timberlands may have a significant impact on our results of operations  due in part to the low cost basis of much of our timber from timberlands that we acquired many years ago 
over the long term  we manage our timberlands on a sustainable yield basis to achieve a balance between timber growth and timber harvests 
from time to time  however  we may choose  consistent with our environmental commitments  to harvest timber at levels above or below our estimate of sustainability for various reasons 
in  the overall harvest from our timberlands was million tons  compared to million tons harvested in based on our current projections that take into consideration such factors as market conditions  the ages of our timber stands and recent timberland acquisitions and sales  we expect the overall timber harvest from our lands in to be between million and million tons  increasing to a range of million to million tons annually over the next few years  depending upon market conditions 
on a short term basis  we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions 
for example  in we deferred a portion of our planned timber harvest in our southern region due to weak markets 
in  however  due to rebounding prices  we significantly increased the harvest from our southern region timberlands  offsetting the deferred harvest 
we also experience seasonally lower harvest activity during the winter and early spring due to weather conditions 
longer term  our timber harvest levels will be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands  such as the idaho timberlands purchased in january and september and the wisconsin timberlands purchased in january  and sales of existing timberlands 
in addition to timberland acquisitions and sales  future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of long term sustainable yield because of genetic improvements and other silvicultural advances  natural disasters  fires and other hazards  regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control 
our timberlands are concentrated in limited geographic areas 
we own approximately million acres of timberland in two regions of the united states the northern region  consisting of our idaho  minnesota and wisconsin timberlands  and the southern region  consisting of our arkansas timberlands 
if the level of production from these regions substantially declines  or if the demand for timber in those regions declines  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues 
we do not insure against losses of timber from any causes 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be affected by natural disasters such as fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  hurricanes  floods and other weather conditions and causes beyond our control 
we assume substantially all risk of loss to the standing timber we own from fire and other hazards because insuring for such losses is not practicable 
consequently  a reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows 
form k 
table of contents changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results 
a number of factors  including tightening of credit  a slowing of residential real estate development  population growth and changes in demographics could reduce the demand for our real estate and negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  changes in the interpretation or enforcement of current laws  or the enactment of new laws  regarding the use and development of real estate  or changes in the political composition of federal  state and local governmental bodies could lead to new or greater costs  delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our real estate business  profitability or financial condition 
also  there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the number of properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales  the plans of adjacent landowners and our expectations of future price appreciation 
delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions may be beyond our control 
these events could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy 
we have pursued  and intend to continue to pursue  acquisitions of strategic timberland properties 
among the reasons for our reit conversion is that we are better able to compete for acquisitions of timberlands against other entities that use tax efficient structures 
it is uncertain whether any timberland acquisitions we make will perform in accordance with our expectations 
in addition  we anticipate using internal revenue code section like kind exchanges  and financing acquisitions through cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions  or any combination thereof 
the failure to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable timberland properties  our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms or our inability to complete like kind exchanges  could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
the forest products industry is highly competitive 
the markets for our wood products are highly competitive  and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our lines of business 
our wood products are subject to competition from wood products manufacturers in north america  and to a lesser extent in canada 
our wood products manufacturing facilities are relatively capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition  particularly during periods of reduced demand 
some of our wood products competitors may currently be lower cost producers than we are  and accordingly these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases 
in addition  wood products are subject to significant competition from a variety of substitute products  including non wood and engineered wood products 
to the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressure from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers  our business could be adversely affected 
our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 
environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing  and are generally becoming more restrictive 
laws  regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted 
these changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber  develop real estate and operate our manufacturing facilities 
these laws and regulations may relate to  among other things  the protection of timberlands  endangered species  timber harvesting practices  recreation and aesthetics  protection and restoration of natural resources  air and water quality  and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater 
over time  the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the potlatch corporation 
table of contents enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified 
we believe that these laws and regulations will continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results 
existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant 
federal  state and local laws and regulations  which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species  as well as waterways and wetlands  limit and may prevent timber harvesting  road building and other activities on our timberlands 
the threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat 
a number of species on our timberlands have been and in the future may be protected under these laws 
if current or future regulations become more restrictive  the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase 
our manufacturing operations are subject to stringent environmental laws  regulations and permits covering air emissions  wastewater discharge  water usage  and waste handling and disposal that govern how we operate our facilities 
these laws  regulations and permits  now and in the future  may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production  and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance 
it is expected that  overall  these costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws and regulations and permit conditions become more stringent  and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding 
we currently own  or formerly owned and operated  manufacturing facilities or may acquire timberlands and other properties that are subject to environmental liabilities  such as remediation of hazardous material contaminations and other existing or potential liabilities 
the cost of investigations and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results 
although we believe we have adequate reserves recorded for the investigation and remediation of our current properties  there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations  or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future 
some environmental statutes impose strict liability  rendering an entity liable for environmental damage without regard to that entity s negligence or fault 
these laws or future legislation or administrative or judicial action with respect to protection of the environment may adversely affect our business 
environmental groups and interested individuals may intervene in the regulatory processes in the locations where we own timberlands and operate our wood products mills 
delays or restrictions on our operations due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings  interested parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits or implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans 
any lawsuit  or even a threatened lawsuit  could delay harvesting on our timberlands or impact our ability to invest in our wood products mills 
our defined benefit pension plans became underfunded at december  as a result of the steep downturn in the stock market in the fourth quarter of  our defined benefit pension plans went from being overfunded to underfunded 
our pension plan funding requirements are based in part on the performance of the assets in our pension plans  and that performance is highly correlated with stock market performance 
depending on the timing of a recovery in the stock market  we could be faced with increased funding requirements that could be substantial in future years 
we depend on external sources of capital for future growth 
our ability to finance growth is dependent to a significant degree on external sources of capital 
our ability to access such capital on favorable terms could be hampered by a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including  without limitation  a decline in general market conditions  decreased market liquidity  a downgrade to our public debt rating  increases in interest rates  an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential  a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our ability to access additional capital may form k 
table of contents also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness  which  among other things  restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividend distributions 
any of these factors  individually or in combination  could prevent us from being able to obtain the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us  and the failure to obtain necessary capital could materially adversely affect our future growth 
reit and tax related risks if we fail to remain qualified as a reit  income from our timberlands will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates and we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our stockholders 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations  including satisfaction of certain asset  income  organizational  distribution  stockholder ownership and other requirements  on a continuing basis 
given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit 
in addition  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury 
changes to the tax laws affecting reits  which may have retroactive application  could adversely affect our stockholders or us 
we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our stockholders or us 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
if in any taxable year we fail to remain qualified as a reit  we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and we will be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock 
in addition  we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost  unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions 
as a result  net income and the funds available for distribution to our stockholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer  which would have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock 
there are uncertainties relating to the estimate of our special e p distribution  which could result in our disqualification as a reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  we were required to distribute to our stockholders all of our accumulated non reit tax earnings and profits  or e p  prior to the end of our first taxable year as a reit  which was december  in  a special e p distribution in the aggregate amount of approximately million was distributed to our stockholders 
we believe that the amount of our special e p distribution equaled or exceeded the amount required to be distributed in order to satisfy the requirements relating to the distribution of e p 
there are  however  uncertainties relating to the determination of the amount of our pre reit e p  including the possibility that the irs could  in any audits for tax years through  successfully assert that our taxable income should be increased  which would increase our pre reit e p 
thus  we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distributed all of our pre reit e p by the close of our first taxable year as a reit 
moreover  although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our pre reit e p  we cannot now determine whether we would be able to take advantage of them or the economic impact on us of doing so 
potlatch corporation 
table of contents certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax on of our net income  which would reduce our cash flow and impair our ability to make distributions 
reits are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the internal revenue code  which for us generally include owning and managing a timberland portfolio  growing timber  and selling standing timber 
accordingly  the manufacture and sale by us of wood products  certain types of timberlands sales  and the harvest and sale of logs are conducted through potlatch trs because such activities generate non qualifying reit income and could constitute prohibited transactions if such activities were engaged in directly by the reit 
in general  prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code to be sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
by conducting our business in this manner  we believe we will satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and avoid the tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction 
we may not always be successful  however  in limiting such activities to potlatch trs 
therefore  we could be subject to the prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur  which would adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to make quarterly distributions 
our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiary may be limited 
the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit limit our ability to use dividends from our wood products manufacturing business for the payment of stockholder distributions 
in particular  at least of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of real estate income 
no more than of our gross income may consist of dividends from potlatch trs and other non qualifying types of income 
this requirement may limit our ability to receive dividends from potlatch trs and may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders using cash flows from potlatch trs 
we may not be able to complete desired like kind exchange transactions for property we sell 
we generally seek to match sales and acquisitions of properties  which allows us to use internal revenue code section like kind exchange tax deferred treatment 
the matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits  primarily the deferral of any gain on the property sold until the ultimate disposition of the replacement property 
while we attempt to complete like kind exchanges whenever possible  it is unlikely that we will be able to do so in all instances due to various factors  including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and the inability to complete a qualifying like kind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the code 
the inability to obtain like kind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold  and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to stockholders 
risks related to our spin off if the spin off is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes  we and our stockholders who received the distribution of clearwater paper common stock could face significant us federal income tax liabilities 
in connection with the spin off  we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs that the spin off will qualify for tax free treatment under applicable sections of the us internal revenue code 
the ruling relies on certain representations  assumptions and undertakings  including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the business of clearwater paper  and the private letter ruling would not be valid if these representations  assumptions and undertakings were incorrect 
moreover  the private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the spin off qualifies for tax free treatment 
the irs could determine that the spin off should be treated as a taxable transaction if form k 
table of contents it determines that any of the representations  assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling were false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions that are not covered by the irs ruling 
if the spin off fails to qualify for tax free treatment  we would be subject to tax as if we had sold clearwater paper common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value  and our stockholders who received the distribution of clearwater paper common stock would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of the clearwater paper common stock that was distributed to them 
furthermore  the income that we would recognize if the spin off were determined to be taxable could cause us to fail to meet the reit tax requirements  including the requirement that at least of our gross income must be derived from sales of standing timber and other types of real estate income 
in addition  certain types of actions by clearwater paper following the spin off  including certain issuances or redemptions of clearwater paper equity securities or involvement in certain other acquisitions of clearwater paper securities  could jeopardize the tax free status of the spin off 
while clearwater paper has agreed not to take theses types of actions and to indemnify us for the consequences of taking these actions  we may not be able to prevent the occurrence of actions by clearwater paper that would cause the spin off not to qualify for tax free treatment 
the obligation represented by the credit sensitive debentures remains our liability until paid and if clearwater paper fails to meet its payment obligations under the retained obligation agreement  holders of the debentures will have legal recourse against us 
in  clearwater paper assumed the obligation to pay all principal and interest on million principal amount of credit sensitive debentures previously issued by our wholly owned subsidiary  potlatch forest holdings  inc the debentures become due and payable in full on december  in connection with the spin off  we entered into the retained obligation agreement with clearwater paper  which provides that clearwater paper will retain the obligation to repay the principal and interest on the debentures 
despite clearwater paper s retention of payment obligations under the debentures  holders of the debentures continue to have legal recourse against potlatch forest holdings  inc for any failure to make payments when due and the obligation represented by the debentures will remain as a liability on our balance sheet until paid 
accordingly  we must retain sufficient liquidity and capital resources to make payments on the debentures in in the event that clearwater paper is unable to meet its payment obligations under the retained obligation agreement 
risks related to ownership of our common stock certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile take over attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interest of us and our stockholders 
the provisions in our certificate or incorporation and bylaws include  among other things  the following a classified board of directors with three year staggered terms  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms  including preferences and voting rights  of those shares without stockholder approval  stockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent and stockholders cannot call a special meeting except upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting  potlatch corporation 
table of contents advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings  removal of directors only for cause  allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors  in order to facilitate the preservation of our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  a prohibition on any single stockholder  or any group of affiliated stockholders  from beneficially owning more than of our outstanding common or preferred stock  unless our board waives or modifies this ownership limitation  unless approved by the vote of at least of our outstanding shares  we may not engage in business combinations  including mergers  dispositions of assets  certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions  with a person owning or controlling  directly or indirectly  or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock  and supermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation 
while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors  they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and  in that case  may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
we are also subject to delaware laws that could have similar effects 
one of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met

item legal proceedings beginning in february  a series of private antitrust lawsuits were filed against us and certain other manufacturers of oriented strand board osb by plaintiffs who claim they purchased osb at artificially high prices 
the cases were consolidated into two consolidated amended class action complaints in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania under the caption in re osb antitrust litigation  one on behalf of direct purchasers of osb and the other on behalf of indirect purchasers 
the complaints alleged that the defendant osb manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws by purportedly conspiring from mid to the present to drive up the price of osb 
the consolidated indirect purchaser complaint also alleged that defendants violated various states unfair competition laws and common law 
each consolidated complaint sought an unspecified amount of monetary damages to be trebled as provided under the antitrust laws and other relief 
the court certified a nationwide class of direct purchasers who bought osb structural panel products directly from one of the defendants during the period from june  to february  it also certified a nationwide class of indirect purchaser end users who purchased new osb manufactured or sold by one of the defendants during the same time period 
the claims of the nationwide indirect purchaser class were limited to injunctive relief 
however  the court also certified a multistate class of indirect purchasers in states whose members could recover compensation as allowed by state law 
although we vigorously deny any wrongdoing  on march   we settled the claims of the direct purchaser class for million and on april   we settled the indirect purchaser class action claims for million  both solely in order to avoid the further expense and burden of the ongoing litigation
