item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expenses for further information 

table of contents in addition  due to unstable political and economic conditions in venezuela  the official and parallel exchange rates could devalue significantly  and we cannot provide any assurances that the official exchange rate will continue to be the rate applicable to translate foreign currency financial statements 
strong devaluations or changes in accounting rules could impact our results materially and we may have to recognize losses in the future 
developments in other markets may affect the latin american countries where we operate  our financial condition and results of operations 
the market value of securities of companies such as ourselves  may be  to varying degrees  affected by economic and market conditions in other global markets 
although economic conditions vary from country to country  investors perception of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries  including latin american countries 
various latin american economies have been adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in recent times  including mexico in  the collapse of several asian economies between and  the economic crisis in russia in  the brazilian devaluations in january of and in  the argentine crisis of and the market decline after september  furthermore  latin american economies may be affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy 
developments of a similar magnitude to the international markets in the future can be expected to adversely affect the economies of latin american countries and therefore us 
e commerce transactions in latin america may be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods 
unlike in the united states  consumers and merchants in latin america can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third party fraud 
as secure methods of payment for e commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in latin america  both consumers and merchants generally have a relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e commerce transactions 
in addition  many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns about credit card fraud 
unless consumer fraud laws in latin american countries are modified to protect e commerce merchants and consumers  and until secure  integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region  our ability to generate revenues from e commerce may be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our company 
argentina and other countries in latin america have experienced adverse economic conditions 
latin american countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth  as well as recession  periods of high inflation and economic instability 
certain countries have experienced severe economic crises  which may still have future effects 
for example  in argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt due to severe economic turmoil 
in the first half of  argentina restructured part of this sovereign debt 
certain creditors did not agree to the restructuring 
argentina s past default and its failure to restructure completely its remaining sovereign debt and fully negotiate with the holdout creditors may prevent argentina obtaining favorable terms or interest rates when accessing the international capital markets 
litigation initiated by holdout creditors or other parties may result in material judgments against the argentine government and could result in attachments of or injunctions relating to assets of argentina that the government intended for other uses 
as a result  the government may not have the financial resources necessary to implement reforms and foster growth  which could have a material adverse effect on the country s economy 
in addition  as a result of this economic instability  the argentine peso has been subject to significant devaluation in the past and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future 
in august  standard poor s inc downgraded argentina s foreign debt rating based upon renewed concerns regarding economic conditions and rising fears of increased inflationary pressures 
such economic turmoil has given rise to significant uncertainties about argentina s economic and political future 
it is currently unclear whether the economic and political instability experienced over the past several years will continue and it is possible  that despite recent economic growth  argentina may return to a deeper recession  higher inflation and unemployment and greater social unrest 
we conduct significant operations in argentina  offering both our mercadolibre marketplace and mercadopago online payments solution in argentina and have our corporate headquarters in that country 
argentina is our third leading revenue producing country 
as a result  our business is to a very large extent dependent upon the economic additions prevalent in argentina and adverse economic conditions in that country could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
internet regulation in the countries where we operate is limited  many legal issues related to e commerce and the internet are unresolved and existing and new laws and regulations related to our business could have a material adverse effect on us 
unlike the united states  none of the countries where we operate have specific laws governing the liability of internet service providers  such as ourselves  for fraud  intellectual property infringement  other illegal activities committed by individual users or third party infringing content hosted on a provider s servers 
this legal uncertainty allows for different judges or courts to decide very similar claims in different ways and establish contradictory jurisprudence 
certain judges may decide that internet service providers are liable to an intellectual property owner for a user s sale of counterfeit items using our platform  while others may decide that the responsibility lies solely with the offending user 
this legal uncertainty allows for rulings against us and could set adverse precedents  which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  legal uncertainty may negatively affect our clients perception and use of our services 

table of contents we are not currently subject to direct government regulation in most of the countries where we operate  other than those regulations applicable to businesses and commerce in general 
it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as general commercial activities  property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel and defamation  obscenity  and personal privacy apply to online businesses 
the majority of these laws were adopted before the internet was available and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet 
due to these areas of legal uncertainty  and the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services  it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services 
these laws and regulations could cover issues such as online commerce  internet service providers responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers  user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  content and quality of products and services  taxation including imposition of value added or sales taxes collection obligations  advertising  intellectual property rights  consumer protection  information storage obligations and information security 
if these laws are enacted  they may have negative effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as our activities and the types of goods listed on our web site grow  regulatory agencies or courts may argue or rule that we or our users must either obtain licenses or not be allowed to conduct business in their jurisdiction  either with respect to our services in general or only relating to certain items  such as auctions  real estate and motor vehicles 
for example  numerous jurisdictions  including brazil and argentina  have regulations regarding auctions and auctioneers and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers 
a bill has been proposed in the brazilian legislature that would specifically apply the auctioneer regulations to on line auctions 
passage of this law or attempted enforcement of existing laws against us or our users and other regulatory and licensing claims could result in expensive litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users do business 
any changes in our or our users business methods could increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of items in some countries and substantially limit our operations in major markets 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties  and any of these outcomes would harm our business 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  other foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws 
as we expand and localize our international activities  we have to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate 
laws regulating internet companies outside of the latin american jurisdictions where we operate may be more restrictive to us than those in latin america 
in order to comply with these laws we may have to change our business practices or restrict our services 
we could be subject to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to bans on our services for failure to comply with foreign laws 
we are also subject to laws relating to the use  storage and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users  especially financial information 
several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area  and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions 
if we violate these laws  which in many cases apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information among ourselves  our subsidiaries  and other parties with which we have commercial relations  we could be subject to significant penalties and negative publicity  which would adversely affect us 
risks related to our shares our common stock has limited trading history  and the price of our shares may fluctuate substantially  and our stockholders investment may decline in value 
our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq global market on august  the trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors  many of which are beyond our control  including those described above under risks related to our business 
further  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for internet related and technology companies in particular  have especially recently  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
we cannot assure you that trading prices and valuations will be sustained 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  such as recession or currency exchange rate fluctuations  may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  that company is often subject to securities class action litigation 
this kind of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we continue to be significantly influenced by a group of stockholders that control a significant percentage of our common shares and the value of our common stock could be negatively effected by any significant disposition of our shares by any of these stockholders 
several stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock 
as of december   ebay owned approximately million shares of our common stock which represents of our outstanding common stock as of december  
certain members of our management also hold a significant percentage of our common stock 
investment entities affiliated with general atlantic llc  collectively  general atlantic  and investment entities affiliated with tiger global  lp  collectively  tiger  beneficially own approximately million and million shares of our common stock  respectively as of december  which represent and  respectively of our outstanding common stock as of december  
these stockholders retain the power to influence the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders may conflict with  or differ from  the interests of other holders of our common shares 
for example  these stockholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or outstanding shares of common stock  sell revenue generating assets or inhibit change of control transactions that benefit other stockholders 
they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business  and as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
so long as these stockholders continue to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock  they will significantly influence all our corporate decisions and together with other stockholders may be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of our company 
additionally  the actual sale  communication of an intention to sell or perceptions that any of the above mentioned stockholders may sell any significant amount of our common stock could negatively impact the market value of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us  prevent a change of control  and may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our management 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit a change of control that our board of directors does not approve or changes in the composition of our board of directors  which could result in the entrenchment of current management 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations  a staggered board of directors  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors other than for cause  limitations on the ability of stockholders to own and or exercise voting power over of our common stock  limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal our by laws  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent  the authority of the board of directors to adopt a stockholder rights plan  the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with any terms that the board of directors determines and additional shares of our common stock  and limitations on the ability of certain stockholders to enter into certain business combinations with us  as provided under section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
see description of capital stock for more information 
we may require additional capital in the future  and this additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion organically or through strategic acquisitions  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
these inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
certain stockholders or entities controlled by them or their permitted transferees will  be able to sell their shares in the public market from time to time without registering them  subject to certain limitations on the timing  amount and method of those sales imposed by regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  or the sec 
holders of restricted stock will also have the right to cause us to register the resale of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them 

table of contents each of general atlantic and tiger agreed that  in respect of the shares each purchased in our initial public offering  neither of them would  without our prior written consent  transfer or dispose of directly or indirectly  any of its shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for our shares  for a period of months following the closing of our initial public offering that closed in august these agreements expired on january  and  accordingly  there are no further contractual restrictions precluding general atlantic and tiger from selling the shares purchased in our initial public offering 
if any of these stockholders  the affiliated entities controlled by them or their respective permitted transferees were to sell a large number of their shares  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
in addition  the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions 
the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 
it is unlikely that we will declare any dividends on our capital stock 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to retain earnings  if any  for future operations and expansion and debt repayments 
in addition  the terms of certain of our credit agreements prohibit the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock 
any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on  among other things  our results of operations  cash requirements  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
our stock repurchase program may not result in a positive return of capital to our stockholders 
in november  we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase plan authorizing us to repurchase  from available capital  up to million of our outstanding common stock from time to time through november  our share repurchases may not return value to stockholders because the market price of our common stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock 
our share repurchase plan is intended to deliver stockholder value over the long term  but stock price fluctuations can reduce the plan s effectiveness 
as part of our share repurchase plan  we may sell put options or engage in structured derivative transactions designed to reduce our cost of repurchasing stock 
in the event of a significant and unexpected drop in our stock price  these arrangements may require us to repurchase shares at price levels that are significantly above the then prevailing market prices of our stock 
these overpayments may have an adverse effect on the effectiveness of our overall share repurchase plan and may reduce value for our stockholders 
requirements associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention 
in connection with our initial public offering  we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  and the other rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq global market 
we are also subject to various other regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting  we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated 
as a result  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm the trading price of our stock 
in addition  in connection with our initial public offering in august  we became subject to the rules of the nasdaq global market 
our compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly 
it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us in us courts 
although we are a delaware corporation  our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the united states 
furthermore  most of our directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the united states 
as a result  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us or our directors or officers in us courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws 
it is unclear if original actions of civil liabilities based solely upon us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states 
it is equally unclear if judgments entered by us courts based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states 
any enforcement action in a court outside the united states will be subject to compliance with procedural requirements under applicable local law  including the condition that the judgment does not violate the public policy of the applicable jurisdiction

on february   the purchase price allocation period finished and the company agreed with the sellers to a working capital adjustment of  to be paid by the sellers to the company 
we offer our users two principal services the mercadolibre marketplace the mercadolibre marketplace  which we sometimes refer to as our marketplace business  is a fully automated  topically arranged and user friendly online commerce service 
this service permits both businesses and individuals to list items and conduct their sales and purchases online in either a fixed price or auction based format 
additionally  through online classified advertisements  our registered users can list and purchase motor vehicles  vessels  aircraft  real estate and services 
any internet user can browse through the various products and services that are listed on our website and register with mercadolibre to list  bid for and purchase items and services 
the mercadopago online payments solution to complement the mercadolibre marketplace  we developed mercadopago  an integrated online payments solution  which we sometimes refer to as our payments business  an integrated online payments solution 
mercadopago is designed to facilitate transactions on the mercadolibre marketplace and off our marketplace in certain markets  by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely  easily and promptly send and receive payments online we operate in six reporting segments  five of which related to our marketplace business and the remainder which relates to our payment business 
within our marketplace business  we separately report our operations in each of brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru and uruguay 
the operations of our payments business  which is available in each of brazil  argentina  mexico and chile  colombia  and venezuela  are reported in one segment 
during  our gross merchandise volume reached  million and visitors to our web site were able to browse an average of over million listings on any given day  organized by country  in over  different product categories

at december   we had million confirmed registered mercadolibre users 
for  we had million unique sellers  million unique buyers and million successful items sold 

table of contents for  our net revenues were million 
of those million in revenues approximately were attributable to mercadolibre marketplace listing  optional feature  final value and advertisement fees 
the remaining of revenues were attributable to mercadopago fees 
although we discuss long term trends in our business  it is our policy to not provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense 
we believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near term results difficult 
further  we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long term welfare of our company and believe focusing on short term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders 
we believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value 
we  therefore  encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock 
a long term focus may make it more difficult for industry analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our company  which could reduce the value of our common stock or permit competitors with short term tactics to grow stronger than us 
description of line items net revenues we recognize revenues in each of our reporting segments 
the mercadolibre marketplace segments include brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru and uruguay

we generate revenues from our mercadopago payments segment by charging users a commission and a financial charge when the user elects to pay in installments  which in both cases we recognize once the transaction is completed 
for the transactions where we finance the extended payment terms internally rather than by discounting receivables  incurring financial debt or selling credit card coupons the financial charge is recognized over the life of the installment financing 
during the year ended december   commission and installment related financial charges averaged and  respectively  of the payment amounts made by the user through mercadopago 
we have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms 
for  and  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in our mercadolibre marketplace business or our mercadopago payments business 
our mercadolibre marketplace is available in countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  mexico  panama  peru  uruguay and venezuela  and mercadopago is available in six countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  mexico and venezuela 
the functional currency in each country s operations is the local currency

additionally  we invest a portion of our marketing budget on cable television advertising in order to improve our brand awareness and to complement our online efforts 
we also work intensively on attracting  developing and growing sellers through our supply efforts

table of contents income and asset tax we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states  as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate 
our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes and asset taxes incurred in these jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting 
therefore  our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable  if any given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry forwards  plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the following table summarizes the composition of our income asset taxes for the years ending december   and year ended december  in millions current federal foreign deferred federal foreign asset tax federal foreign income asset tax expense 
table of contents seasonality the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the twelve quarters set forth below quarter ended march  june  september  december  net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income loss net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted for the quarters ended march  june  and september  the diluted eps is equal to the basic eps 
seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and retail seasonality have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
typically  the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the christmas season 
however  the result of our operations in the fourth quarter of have been impacted by the global economic crisis and  for that reason  our fourth quarter revenues were lower when measured in us dollars than the third quarter revenues  as a result of local currencies depreciating versus the us dollar during the period 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the impact of this global crisis on our operations for and beyond 
our slowest period is typically the first quarter of the year 
the months of january  february and march normally correspond to summer vacation time in argentina  brazil  chile  peru and uruguay 
additionally  the easter holiday falls in march or april  and brazil celebrates carnival for one week in february or march 
this is partially mitigated by the countries located in the northern hemisphere  such as colombia  mexico and venezuela for which the slowest months are their summer months of july  august and september 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee and board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other disclosures included in with this report 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired on this basis  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level considering each segment of the company as a reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
cash flow projections used are based on financial budgets approved by management 
the growth rates applied do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the business in which the reporting unit operates 
the average discount rate used is which reflects the company s real weighted average cost of capital 
key drivers in the analysis include gross merchandise volume gmv which represents a measure of the total us dollar amount of all transactions completed through the mercadolibre marketplace  excluding motor vehicles  vessels  aircraft  real estate  and services and take rate defined as marketplace revenues as a percentage of gross merchandise volume 
in addition  market share in the analysis include a business to e commerce rate  which represents growth of e commerce as a percentage of gdp  internet penetration rates as well as trends in the company s market share 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
no impairments were recognized during the reporting periods and  management s assessment of each reporting unit value in use materially exceeds its carrying value 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because i it requires management to make assumptions about future interest rates  sales and costs  and ii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net income would be material 
our management s assumptions about future sales and future costs require significant judgment 
provision for doubtful accounts we are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of future losses based on our historical experience 
our provision for doubtful accounts amounted to million at december   million at december  and million at december  the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to sales and marketing expenses 
the following table illustrates our bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues for  and year ended december  in millions  except percentages net revenues bad debt charges bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues historically  our actual losses have been consistent with our charges 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to provision for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future collections and credit analysis 
our management s assumptions about future collections requires significant judgment 

table of contents legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in business legal proceedings  and in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense could be costly and could divert management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay damages or modify our business practices 
any of these results could materially harm our business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon taxable income and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws in each jurisdiction and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign and domestic net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized

the fluctuations in the valuation allowance will depend on the capacity of each country operation to generate taxable income or our execution of future tax planning strategies that allow us to use the aforementioned deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income

no stock option equity grants were made during and the following table summarizes information with respect to our stock option equity grants during fair estimated value of fair value grant options exercise common of stock date granted price stock options january  july  october  we calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the fair value of our common stock  volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
since we have no history of volatility  the expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of similar entities common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the awards 
the expected term of an award is based on the simplified method allowed by sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no

the risk free interest rate is based on the rate on us treasury zero coupon issues with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards 
we have not paid any dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future and accordingly  use an expected dividend yield of zero

the fair value of our common stock at each grant date prior to our initial public offering in august  was based on internally developed valuations 
we did not engaged an independent third party valuation specialist and cannot assure you that an independent valuation firm would not determine different valuations for our common stock 
we have based our internally developed valuations on our analysis of valuations of our significant subsidiaries completed by an unrelated third party valuation specialist as of december   complemented by internally prepared projections and analyses of our company 
the valuations of the subsidiaries were prepared to perform impairment tests as required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we believe that a combination of these independent valuations and the experience of our internal accounting staff produced reasonable valuations of the fair value of our common stock 

table of contents the difference between our estimate of the fair value of our common stock as of october and our initial public offering price in august related to improvements in our financial performance  improved prospects as we increase in size and scope  appreciation of the currencies in the countries in which we operate versus the us dollar resulting in increased revenues and profits measured in us dollars  and other factors that were relevant in setting initial our public offering price in august but that were not necessarily considered in the determination of the fair value of our common stock pursuant to sfas r  such as improved multiples of comparable publicly traded companies and then prevailing market conditions for public offerings of equity securities 
the fair value of our common stock at the october  grant date  was per share 
factors affecting our october estimate of the fair value of our common stock pursuant to sfas r that we had not considered in setting our initial public offering price in august include a discount rate of applied in october versus a rate of that we would have applied if we were to perform the same analysis as of the date of the initial public offering prospectus the reduced applicable rate resulting primarily from lower current interest rates in the countries in which we operate and the lower estimated risk associated with our company given our increased profitability and scale of operations since october  the fact that the october discounted cash flow model had a starting date nine months or more prior to the one that would be applied if we were to have performed the same analysis as of the date of the initial public offering prospectus  which starting dates have a substantial impact on valuation in a business with significantly increasing profitability like ours  a discount related to the lack of liquidity of our shares of common stock in october and an approximately discount related to the negative effect of preferred stock liquidation preferences upon completion of our initial public offering in august  all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock

from to  our gross merchandise volume increased by  our successful items increased by and mercadopago total payment volume increased by 
from to  those growth rates were  and  respectively 
our growth in net revenues was from to and from to as our business grows  we expect that this year to year rate of increase of net revenues and the related operational metrics  will decline 
additionally  currently weak global macro economic growth  coupled with possible devaluations of local currencies in latin america versus the us dollar  and high interest rates  could even lead to declining year to year net revenues and related operational metrics 
diversification of revenues from year to year we have been growing revenues from our payments business at a faster rate than our revenues from our marketplace business  and anticipate this trend to continue 
for the year  revenues from our payments business represented of net revenues 
for the year and  payments revenues represented and of our net revenues  respectively 
this trend is sensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations  primarily in interest rates for consumer credit  and might be interrupted during periods of higher costs of lending as the one we are currently in 
gross profit margins our business has generated sustained high gross profit margins over time  as defined by total net revenues minus total cost of net revenues  as a percentage of net revenues 
these gross margins were for  for and for variations in gross profit margins are mainly attributable to increased economies of scale in customer service  internet service provider isp connectivity and site operations  improved economic terms obtained from payment processors as well as increases in interest fees that we charge our mercadopago buyers  that more than offset a faster rate of increase of our lower gross profit margin payments business 
we expect that gross profit margins could decline in the future if cost of net revenues increase as a percentage of net revenues as our payments business grows faster relative to our marketplace business  if we cannot sustain the economies of scale that we have achieved  or if we decrease the interest fees charged

for the past three years  our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues has improved from for  to for  and to for  mostly as a result of the impact of economies of scale and from improvements in gross profit margins 
we anticipate  however  that as a result of the high operating income margin achieved in  and as we continue to invest in product development  sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses and in human resources in order to promote our services and capture the long term business opportunity offered by the internet in latin america  it will become increasingly difficult to sustain growth in operating income margins  and at some point in the future we could experience decreasing operating income margins

on june   we released to the former shareholders million of the total management escrow agreement  in exchange for a discount 
these compensation cost were fully accrued in the first half of the compensation expense was recorded as operating expenses  instead of considering them part of the purchase price  following eitf accounting for contingent consideration paid to the shareholders of an acquired enterprise in a purchase business combination see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
there is no expense related to compensation cost in the second half of other income expenses our other expenses were million for  an increase of million from other expenses of million for the increase during the year ended december  was primarily a result of an increase in interest expense and other financial charges from million in to million in the increase of interest expense and other financial charges was mainly attributable to an increase of million in interest expenses from million for to million for  as a result of financing incurred to fund working capital needs in our payments operations in brazil and related to the seller financing of the deremate acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to sell all the credit card coupons at that time related to funds receivable from customers in our mercadopago business  for million  which resulted in our incurrence of an expense of million 
as of december   total interest expense relating to the working capital requirements for our mercadopago operations have been recorded as interest expense and not as cost of net revenues 
in the year ended december   interest expenses of million  have been reclassified for comparison purposes to current year s presentation 

table of contents the increase in interest expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in foreign currency losses from million in  to million in this decrease was primarily due to a foreign currency gain of million recorded in the fourth quarter of  which was mainly a result of a positive impact of the net assets denominated in us dollars position of our venezuelan subsidiaries 
venezuela has a dual exchange rate system that comprises an official exchange rate which was bolivares fuertes per us dollar at december   and a parallel exchange rate that was bolivares fuertes per us dollar at december  based on a change in the accounting standards to international financial reporting standard ifrs implemented by venezuela in  which establishes that the parallel exchange rate should be used to account for assets and liabilities in us dollars in the statutory local financial statements  we will be recording positive retained earnings in our two main subsidiaries in venezuela  mercadolibre venezuela sa and grupo veneclasificados ca  as of december  we anticipated that this positive result will allow us to access us dollars at the official exchange rate  after a process that includes obtaining approval from the venezuelan commission of exchange administration cadivi  to distribute dividends 
if the cadivi approves the transaction  the venezuelan subsidiaries could then sell us dollars held in the united states at the parallel exchange rate  buy bolivares fuertes  and then distribute dividends buying the us dollars at the official exchange rate 
therefore  based on paragraph a of fas foreign currency translation  the venezuelan subsidiaries have re measured the asset and liabilities in us dollar balances outstanding at the december  parallel exchange rate 
further  in accordance with paragraph b of fas  the venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expense accounts were translated at the rate applicable for dividend remittances  which at december  is the official exchange rate 
according to the international practices task force joint meeting with sec staff of june   the existence of a parallel market does not constitute unusual circumstances potentially justifying the use of an exchange rate other than the official rate for purposes of foreign currency translation 
before the fourth quarter of  this asset position  which is mainly comprised of cash and short term investments held in us bank accounts  had been historically re measured at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar  because a the subsidiaries used the us bank account balances to pay foreign suppliers  b there was no management intention to return those funds to venezuela and c mercadolibre venezuela had no accumulated profits to make a dividend distribution for statutory purposes 
that re measurement of the net asset position contributed a positive million foreign currency gain in the fourth quarter of in our consolidated statements of income and million for the full year 
the after tax positive effect on net income of the re measurement was million in the fourth quarter  and million for the full year 
this re measurement was included as non current other assets for million in our consolidated balance sheets 
the re measurement of the liabilities amounting to million was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we could have to record foreign currency losses in the future to reverse these gains  or for other factors 
given the risks in venezuela see risk factors we may incur losses in the event we are unable to distribute dividends from our venezuelan subsidiaries at the official exchange rate  or as a result of changes in the political  economic or regulatory environment in venezuela  and political and economic conditions in venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations additionally  we had foreign currency losses of million in the fourth quarter of  and of million in for the full year  in all the other countries combined 
in addition  we had no impact from the accrual of expenses related to the fair value of warrants in  versus million of that were recorded for the year ended december   and we had a million increase of interest income and other financial charges  that included accrued gains related to changes in the fair value of put options  from million in to million in income and asset tax our reported income and asset tax expense for was million compared to a reported expense of million for our blended tax rate as a percentage of income before income and asset tax was for and for the increase of our blended tax rate is consequence of certain factors including the impact of a new million mexican tax called impuesto empresarial a tasa nica ietu  which affects our mexican operations  the impact of million of foreign exchange losses in venezuela that were not deductible  and by the impact of million of accrued compensation expenses because this charge reduced pre tax income  but the related tax credit had a full valuation allowance 
with regards to these compensation expenses  we followed the guidance in eitf accounting for contingent consideration paid to the shareholders of an acquired enterprise in a purchase business combination see compensation cost related to acquisitions above 
in addition  the blended tax rate was reduced due to a reverse of the valuation allowance related to our mexican operations for millions 
our blended tax rate in  without including the reverse of the mexican valuation allowance  would have been 
as a result of the effect of permanent differences  our effective tax rate was approximately for and for the variation in the effective tax rate for these periods reflects the taxes payable plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the effective income tax rate excludes the effects of the deferred income tax  and of the above mentioned mexican tax

other expenses in were partially offset by million in interest income  an increase of million  up from million in income and asset tax our reported income and asset tax expense for was million compared to a reported expense of million for our blended tax rate as a percentage of income before income and asset tax was for and for however  as a result of the effect of permanent differences  our effective tax rate was approximately for and for the variation in the effective tax rate for these periods reflects the taxes payable plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities

table of contents factors affecting results of operations and financial condition our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as online commerce and emerging markets like latin america 
to address these risks and uncertainties  we must  among other things  maintain and increase the number of our confirmed registered users  items listed on our service and completed transactions  maintain and enhance our brand  implement and execute our business and marketing strategy successfully  continue to develop and upgrade our technology and information processing systems  continue to enhance the mercadolibre and mercadopago services to meet the needs of a changing market  provide superior customer service  respond to competitive developments  and attract  integrate  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
accordingly  we intend to invest heavily in marketing and promotion  site development  technology and operating infrastructure development and personnel 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will be successful in accomplishing all of these goals  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we have experienced significant revenue growth and significant growth in the number of our confirmed registered users and items listed by our users in recent periods  such growth rates are not sustainable and will decrease in the future 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our operating results have varied on an annual basis during our short operating history and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
the following list includes factors that may affect our operating results continued growth of online commerce and internet usage in latin america  our ability to expand our operations and adapt to rapidly changing technologies  governmental regulation in the countries where we operate  including exchange controls  litigation  legal liability and intellectual property rights enforcement  system interruptions or failures  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  the announcement or introduction of new sites  services and products by us or our competitors  and price competition  reliance on third party service providers  increasing consumer confidence in and acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce and  in particular  the trading of products such as those listed on our web site  security breaches and consumer confidence in the security of transactions over the internet  consumer trends and popularity of certain categories of items  our ability to attract new customers  retain existing customers and increase revenues  seasonal fluctuations  and political  social and economic conditions in latin america  particularly venezuela  including foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
also see item a risk factors for a discussion of factors that could adversely affect our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our main cash requirement historically has been working capital to fund mercadopago financing operation in brazil 
we also require cash for capital expenditures relating to technology infrastructure  software applications and office space 
in addition  we require cash to repay the promissory notes related to deremate operations acquisition 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through contributions received from our stockholders obtained during the first two years of operations  from funds raised during our initial public offering  and from cash generated from our operations 
we have funded mercadopago by discounting credit card receivables  with loans backed with credit card receivables  selling credit cards coupons and through cash advances derived from our mercadolibre marketplace business 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  in addition to million of long term investments  provided by cash generated from operations as well as the net proceeds of our initial public offering 

table of contents the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses  funds receivable from and payable to mercadopago users  and short term debt 
as mercadopago grows as a percentage of total revenues we anticipate increased working capital needs 
historically  we have funded these needs through a combination of sale of credit card coupons to financial institutions  loans backed by credit card receivables and cash advances from our marketplace business  and currently we are relying mostly on transferring credit card receivables to financial institutions 
the following table presents our cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the three years ended december   and year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents total decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non cash items  and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
this improvement was primarily a result of a decrease in funds receivable from customers of million from million in to million in  mainly due to sales of credit card receivables to financial institutions in order to finance our mercadopago business  whereas in the past we had sold only a portion of the credit card receivables we held 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we transferred credit card receivables to financial institutions accounted for as a sale of financial assets under fas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement  at that time related to funds receivable from customers in our mercadopago business 
for that reason as of december  we no longer recognized the credit card portfolio as assets and no liability was recorded 
this sale of receivables generated significant additional cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by an increase in net income of million to million for  from million in net cash provided by operating activities also increased as a consequence of a million decreases in accounts receivable  and million increase in accounts payable 
these increases in cash provided by operations were partially offset by a decrease of million in funds payable to customers related to our payments segment  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in also affecting cash provided by operations were the decrease in non cash charges to earnings such as foreign currency gains of million related to our venezuelan cash and cash equivalents and investments see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expenses  and note other non current assets to our consolidated financial statements for more detail  changes in fair value of warrants during the year ended december  of million  and the increase in other liabilities of million 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
this improvement was primarily a result of an increase in net income of million to million for  from million in  and non cash charges to earnings such as depreciation and amortization on our assets for million  and changes in the fair value of warrants for million 
cash provided by working capital in our marketplace segment was more than offset by cash used in working capital in our payments segment 
in we began to finance payments funds payable with loans backed with payments credit card receivables  which are recorded as financial debt  and not as a reduction in the receivable balance  and therefore the cash inflow is recorded as cash flow from financing activities in the statements of cash flows  and not as cash flow from operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the annual cash flow provided by operating activities was greater than net income for the year  due primarily to non cash charges to earnings such as depreciation and amortization on our assets  changes in fair value of warrants  deferred income taxes and realized gains on investments 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for and million for for  net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from purchases of investments in the amount of million which includes million for our real estate investment in the arias trust and payments made for the cmg and deremate acquisitions  net of cash acquired  for million 
the purchase of deremate  includes the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired of million  customer lists and non compete agreement net of tax of million and goodwill of million and the purchase of of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of cmg which includes the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired of million  trademarks of million and goodwill of million 
the cmg acquisition related cash outflow on our statement of cash flows amounted to million which is net of million of cash acquired and excludes million recorded as compensation expense and not as part of the purchase price  following eitf see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements and general and administrative above 
the deremate acquisition related outflow on our statement of cash flows does not include million of promissory notes issued to the seller net of certain working capital adjustments 
additionally  net cash used in investing activities includes million of capital expenditures related to technological equipment  software licenses and to a lesser degree office equipment 
during the year ended december   the use of cash for investment activities was partially offset by our receipt of million of cash proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments mainly due to sale of investments to pay acquisitions and as part of our financial strategy 
for  net cash used in investing activities was compared to million for net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from purchases of investment grade listed debt securities with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering in august  as part of our financial investment strategy 
purchases of investments accounted for million of cash used in investing activities 
this use of cash in investment activities was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investments primarily debt securities and certificates of deposit of million 
for  net cash provided by investing activities resulted primarily from purchases of investments with our cash and cash equivalents  partially offset for sales of those investments  as part of our financial investment strategy 
net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for and net cash provided by financing activities of million for during  the main factor that contributed to our use of cash in financing activities was a reduction in our financing from loans backed by payments credit card receivables of million  and million used to repurchase shares of our common stock see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we transferred credit card receivables to financial institutions accounted for as a sale of financial assets under fas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement 
for that reason as of december  we no longer recognized the credit card portfolio as assets and no liability was recorded 
the loans backed by credit card receivables used in were recorded keeping the credit card portfolio as an account receivable and a debt for the commitments with banks 
the difference in the accounting treatment generates the decrease in net cash provided by used in financing activities 
the promissory notes issued to the seller related to the acquisition of deremate net of certain working capital adjustments for million was considered as a non cash transaction and for that reason was not included as net cash provided by financing activities 
in the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future  we may fund them with available cash  third party debt financing  or by raising equity capital  as market conditions allow 
for  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to the issuance of common stock from our initial public offering which provided cash in the amount of million  the increase in short term debt of million to finance our payments segment  consisting of loans backed with payments credit card receivables  as described above in the section net cash provided by operating activities  offset by the million of cash used to pay the balance of the loan from ebay 
net cash used in financing activities for was attributable to a partial prepayment of principal of the loan from ebay 
debt in connection with the deremate acquisition  on september   we issued to the seller ten unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
these promissory notes mature as follows i  on june  ii  on september   iii  on december  and  iv  on march  the promissory notes bear interest at plus for the first four months  for the second four months and for the remaining period up to its maturity and can be prepaid by the company without penalty 
see recent acquisitions section of this report 
as of december  the balance of those promissory notes was disclosed in our balance sheet net of certain working capital adjustments for million as principal and million as interest accrued 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  we have agreed that  for as long as the notes are outstanding  we will not incur indebtedness  on a consolidated basis  in excess of million including the debt incurred under the notes  except for intercompany debt or guarantees and guarantees provided by us or our affiliates under any discount of funds receivable from customers of mercadopago 

table of contents in  we began to finance payments funds payable in part with loans backed by payments credit card receivables  which were recorded as financial debt  and not as a reduction in the receivable balance 
as of december   we had million in loans of this type 
as a result  the cash inflow was recorded as cash flow from financing activities in the statements of cash flows  and not as cash flow from operating activities 
as discussed in net cash provided by used in financing activities section  during  we have been primarily transferring credit card receivables to financial institutions  accounted for as a sale of financial assets under fas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement and for that reason no liability has been recorded as of december  in  we financed the acquisition of deremate with a loan from ebay  one of our stockholders  in the amount of million  secured by our assets  including equity interests we have acquired in deremate 
the loan bore an interest rate of per year  payable in november of each year 
the loan matured on the issuance of securities upon the closing of our initial public offering 
at december   no principal or interest on the loan remained outstanding as we repaid the loan in full with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering in august capital expenditures our capital expenditures increased by million in as compared to  to million for as compared to million for this increase was mainly due to million recorded as capital expenditures in connection with our cmg and deremate acquisitions net of cash acquired  as described above in the sections liquidity and capital resources and net cash used in investing activities and million related to the deremate seller financing net of certain working capital adjustments 
additionally  in property and equipment we primarily recorded purchases of hardware and software licenses necessary to maintain and update the technology of our platform  and to a lesser degree cost of computer software developed internally  office equipment and investing in new office space 
these expenditures were million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures in the future as we strive to maintain our position in the latin american e commerce market 
in  our argentine subsidiary invested in a real estate trust 
the investment in this trust represents a beneficial ownership interest in  square meters divided in five floors of an office building and parking spots under construction in the city of buenos aires  argentina  where we expect to relocate our office headquarters upon completion of the building 
as of december   the argentine subsidiary paid million into the trust 
for us gaap purposes the investment was recorded as a long term investment instead of as property and equipment 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  including the net proceeds from our initial public offering  selling credit card receivables and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  property and equipment expenditures and to repay the promissory notes related to the deremate operations acquisition and other obligations going forward 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities for the purpose of facilitating contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing materially from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amount of payments 
below is a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the table 
contractual obligations at december  are as follows payment due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations long term obligations principal long term obligations interest total includes leases of office space 
on june   our argentine subsidiary offered to participate in a real estate trust  which investment represents a beneficial ownership interest in  square meters divided in five floors of an office building and parking spots under construction in the city of buenos aires  argentina 
we expect to relocate our office headquarters to this newly acquired office space upon completion of the building  which we expect to occur in the second quarter of under the terms of our commitments  the total estimated contractual obligation with the trust is million which shall be paid within months 
as of december   the argentine subsidiary has invested million in the aforementioned trust 
due to the impact of the argentine inflation  future payments could differ significantly from our estimates 
certain of our officers and former officers also entered into an investment in a portion of the trust  which investment represents a beneficial ownership interest in a separate floor of the same building 
we do not intend to occupy the space to be owned by this group 
due to deremate acquisition  on september   the company issued to the sellers ten unsecured promissory notes having an aggregate principal amount of  these promissory notes mature as follows i  on june  ii  on september   iii  on december  and  iv  on march  the promissory notes bear interest at plus for the first four months  for the second four months and for the remaining period up to its maturity and can be prepaid by the company without penalty 

table of contents we have leases for office space in certain countries in which we operate 
these are our only operating leases 
purchase obligation amounts include an obligation in arias trust  minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures technological equipment and software licenses and other goods and services that were entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we have developed estimates to project payment obligations based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations 
these market risks arise mainly from the possibility that changes in interest rates and the us dollar exchange rate with local currencies  particularly the brazilian reais due to brazil s share of our revenues  may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities 
foreign currencies risk at december   the seller financing related to the acquisition of deremate consisting of unsecured promissory notes for an aggregate principal amount of million  which will be settled for million due to million of working capital adjustments was denominated in us dollars 
we also hold cash and cash equivalents in local currencies in our subsidiaries  and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations 
our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in local currency 
as a result  our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
at december   the total cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled million  and accounts receivable and funds receivable from customers in foreign currencies totaled million 
to manage exchange rate risk  our treasury policy is to transfer all cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into dollar denominated accounts in the united states 
at december   these dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
for the year ended december   we incurred in foreign currency losses in the amount of million as the cash balances of the subsidiaries held in us dollars depreciated in local current terms  partially offset by a change in the re measurement of the net assets position of our venezuelan subsidiaries see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expenses for more detail 
our venezuelan subsidiaries re measure their foreign currency cash and cash equivalents and investments at the parallel exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
since there is an observable market rate of exchange for securities traded in the parallel market  based on facts and circumstances this market rate has been used for the re measurement of foreign currency denominated transactions that could be settled through the parallel market mechanism 
according to paragraph of fas foreign currency translation  in the absence of unusual circumstances  the rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances shall be used to translate foreign currency statements 
furthermore  based on the international practices task force joint meeting with sec staff of june   the existence of a parallel market does not constitute unusual circumstances potentially justifying the use of an exchange rate other than the official rate for purposes of foreign currency translation 
the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar is used for dividend remittance 
the foreign currency effect generated by applying different exchange rates on the above mentioned assets has been accounted for in non current other assets for a total amount of million 
in addition  if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
during the year ended december   of our revenues were denominated in brazilian reais  in venezuelan bolivares fuertes  in argentine pesos  and in mexican pesos 
we have estimated that the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations for the year period ended december  resulted in higher net revenues of approximately million  and higher aggregate cost of net revenues and operating expenses of approximately million  as compared to the same period in for net income  we estimated an increase of million for the year ended december  this calculation was made taking the average monthly exchange rates for each month in  and applying them to the corresponding months in  so as to calculate what our financial results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next 

table of contents the following table summarizes the distribution of net revenues based on geography year ended december  in millions brazil argentina mexico venezuela other countries total we have entered in the past into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure but during have not entered into any such agreement 
interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates 
these changes can have an impact on our interest expenses derived from selling our mercadopago receivables 
at december   mercadopago funds receivable from customers totaled approximately million 
interest fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits  money market funds  investment grade corporate debt securities  sovereign debt securities and treasury bills 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
in addition  we issued unsecured promissory notes to finance the deremate acquisition  for an aggregate principal amount of million 
these promissory notes mature as follows i  on june  ii  on september   iii  on december  and  iv  on march  the promissory notes bear interest at plus for the first four months  for the second four months and for the remaining period up to its maturity and can be prepaid by the company without penalty 
fixed rate liabilities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a decrease in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
due to the short term nature of the main part of our investments  a basis point movement in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total fair market value of our portfolio as of december  or interest expenses derived from discounting our mercadopago receivables or our promissory notes issued in connection with the deremate acquisition 
we consider a majority of our investments to be short term investments  which are classified on our balance sheet as current assets in the amount of million  because the investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
time deposits  corporate debt securities and sovereign debt securities are considered held to maturity securities 
the book value of held to maturity securities approximates their respective fair values and consequently there are no significant unrecognized gains or losses 
credit risk we invest in high quality financial instruments  consisting primarily of time deposits  money market funds  investment grade corporate and sovereign debt securities  and treasury bills  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
credit risk is risk due to uncertainty in a counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations 
for the year ended december   market perception of these risks  together with certain market dislocations  had an adverse effect on the fair value of certain classes of securities  including in some cases  high quality financial instruments that were not previously viewed as having credit risk 
we seek  however  to minimize such risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are believed to be creditworthy financial institutions or classes which we believe have not been affected by the current credit market environment 
equity price risk in connection with our share repurchase program  we sell put options that may require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices 
these written put options subject us to equity price risk 
at december   put options to purchase  shares of our common stock were outstanding  enabling the holders to sell in the aggregate  shares of our common stock upon exercise for approximately million net of the option premium received 
the put option liability  with a fair value of million at december   was included in loans payable and other financial liabilities 
the fair value of our shares should fall to to settle our million in premium received
