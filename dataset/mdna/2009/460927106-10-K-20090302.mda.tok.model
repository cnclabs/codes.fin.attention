intervest bancshares corporation has two wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries  intervest national bank and intervest mortgage corporation together with intervest bancshares corporation are referred to collectively as the company on a consolidated basis in this report 
intervest bancshares corporation  intervest national bank and intervest mortgage corporation may be referred to individually as ibc  inb and imc  respectively  in this report 
ibc also has four wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v  all of which were formed at various times in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities 
for a more detailed discussion of the company s business  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report and item of part i of this report on form k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis herein is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in the company s financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
among the more significant policies of the company are those that govern accounting for loans and the allowance for loan losses 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in its financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 
the company believes that currently its only significant critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about future loan chargeoffs 
the impact of a large chargeoff could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect the company s earnings and financial position 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s judgment as to the estimated losses that may result from defaults in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of previous chargeoffs are added back to the allowance 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses at least monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the following factors i size of the loans in the portfolio 
the loan portfolio has many individual loans with large principal balances  which increases the portfolio s risk profile 
at december   the average real estate loan was million  with the largest loan being million 
in addition  loans with principal balances of million or more represented of the portfolio 

table of contents ii nature concentration of the loans in the portfolio 
the loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate  including some vacant properties and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional family residential lending because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to single borrowers and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate for income producing properties 
loans on vacant properties and vacant land typically do not have income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment 
the number of vacant land loans in the portfolio has decreased substantially over the last several years 
the properties collateralizing the loans are also concentrated by location  and this concentration also increases the risk associated with the portfolio 
the properties are concentrated in two states  new york and florida 
economic conditions and real estate values in florida are currently depressed and new york is also experiencing weakening economic conditions and lower real estate values 
a large number of the properties in new york are located in manhattan  brooklyn  queens  long island  staten island and the bronx 
a large number of the properties in florida are located in clearwater  tampa  st 
petersburg  orlando  fort lauderdale  hollywood and miami 
many of the multifamily properties located in new york city and surrounding boroughs are also subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents  which may in turn limit the borrower s ability to repay those mortgage loans 
many of the properties are also located in sections of the cities noted above that are being revitalized or redeveloped 
all of these factors increase the risk profile of the portfolio 
iii specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties 
whenever a loan experiences payment problems  an internal review of that loan is performed by either or both of the company s two senior lending officers the chairman and the president of inb to re evaluate the internal credit rating that is assigned to the loan 
this credit rating directly affects the computation of the allowance for loan losses 
the estimated loss factors that the company applies to its loans to calculate the allowance for loan losses increase as a loan s credit rating decreases 
nonaccrual and or problem loans are normally downgraded based on known facts and circumstances at the time of review  which in turn impacts the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the review includes the physical inspection of such properties and the monitoring of impositions and insurance premiums to preserve the company s security interest in the properties 
additionally  the company engages independent third parties to perform quarterly loan portfolio reviews  which include all loans on nonaccrual status 
the company takes into consideration the nature and extent of the collateralization of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days and still accruing and any other problem loans in its determination of the allowance for loan losses 
estimates of fair value of the collateral properties is determined based on a variety of information  including available appraisals and the knowledge and experience of the two senior lending officers related to values of properties in the company s market areas 
determination of the need for updated appraisals is made on a loan by loan basis 
in addition to appraisals  consideration is also given to the type  location and occupancy of the property and current economic conditions in the area the property is located in assessing estimates of fair value 
iv historical chargeoffs and recoveries 
the company has experienced a limited number of loan charge offs to date 
in computing the allowance  the company currently does not place much reliance on its historical losses 
a greater weight is placed on the current level of nonaccrual loans and the specific circumstances for which potential losses may exist in the portfolio 
although the company has never originated or acquired subprime loans nor invested in securities collateralized by subprime loans  the subprime loan crisis and resulting impact on the credit markets in has affected the company indirectly through reductions in overall real estate values and a weakening of the overall economy  both in florida and new york 
the company has also experienced the effects of misconduct committed by certain of its borrowers  which required the company to place certain loans that are collateralized by income producing properties on nonaccrual status  in some instances due to involuntary bankruptcy filings filed against the borrowers by third party creditors 
such filings resulted in the cessation of monthly loan payments and have delayed the company s ability to move forward with foreclosure or other proceedings to acquire and sell the collateral property 

table of contents v adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay 
all nonaccrual and problem loans are reviewed individually based on the facts and circumstances known to the company at the time of the review 
based on these reviews  the company s two senior lending officers make an assessment as to whether there are specific issues unique to each problem loan or whether such issues identified are generic to the portfolio  which may in turn necessitate a change to the overall estimated loss factors that are used to calculate the allowance 
vi the perception of the company s two senior lending officers of current and anticipated economic conditions in the company s primary lending areas  which are concentrated in new york and florida  and national economic conditions 
the real estate market is in a general slowdown that began in  with the magnitude thereof being more pronounced in certain areas of the country than others and in certain types of properties 
in addition  the recent crisis in the credit markets and resulting turmoil on wall street has also negatively impacted the economy and real estate values by reducing the amount of funds available for lending in general 
these factors have increased the level of risk in the portfolio and will likely continue to negatively impact the portfolio in vii trends in loan volume and loan terms  changes in risk selection  underwriting standards and lending policies and procedures 
the company has not relaxed its underwriting standards or its lending policies procedures  and believes it has become more risk averse by being more selective in the current economic environment 
loan to value ratios the ratio that the original principal amount of the loan bears to the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan at the time of origination on new loans typically do not exceed 
debt service coverage ratios the ratio of the net operating income generated by the property securing the loan to the required debt service on new real estate loans typically are not less than times 
viii experience  ability and depth of lending officers and other underwriting staff 
all potential new loans are referred to one of the company s two senior lending officers  both of whom have substantial experience in commercial and multifamily real estate lending 
generally  all loans originated must be first reviewed and approved by a loan committee and undergoes extensive underwriting procedures 
the company believes that there is substantial experience on its lending staff 
based on the management s assessment of all the factors discussed above  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses that is comprised of an unallocated portion which is derived from estimated loss factors currently ranging from to multiplied by the principal amount of loans rated acceptable  and higher percentages for loans that are assigned a lower credit grade and an allocated or specific portion on loans that have been identified as being impaired under statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas specifies the manner in which the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired under sfas when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as the company s commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on one of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a specific valuation allowance recorded as part of the overall allowance for loan losses with a charge to expense through the provision for loan losses 
the company considers a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimum delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by management that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  management generally considers delinquencies of days or less to be minimum delays  and accordingly does not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status 
generally  all of the company s loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis using the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral 

table of contents the company believes  based on information known to it at december   that its allowance for loan losses was adequate to cover estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of december  although the company believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if facts and circumstances differ from those previously assumed in the determination of the allowance 
for example  a prolonged downturn in real estate values and economic conditions could have an adverse impact on the company s asset quality and may result in an increase in future loan charge offs and loan loss provisions  and may also result in the decrease in the estimated value of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
finally  the company s regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and the estimated values of real estate acquire through foreclosure 
accordingly  the company may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses  or record write downs on the carrying values of foreclosed real estate based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination

loan fees receivable are fees due in accordance with the terms of mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
this fee is recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment 
the decrease was due to payments exceeding new fees that were charged on new loan originations 
premises and equipment decreased as purchases were more than offset by normal depreciation and amortization 
the deferred income tax asset relates primarily to the unrealized tax benefit on the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance has been expensed for financial statement purposes but it is currently not deductible for income tax purposes until actual loan chargeoffs are incurred 
the increase in the deferred tax asset is primarily a function of the net increase in the allowance for loan losses 
deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the net decrease was due to normal amortization as well as the accelerated expensing of costs associated with early repayments of debentures prior to their contractual maturity dates

the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is greater than the interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  demand deposits and stockholders equity

intervest national bank 
inb s lending business is dependent on its ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the yields earned on its loans and the rates offered on its deposits 
inb needs to pay competitive interest rates to attract and retain deposits to fund its loan originations 
in  inb experienced competitive market conditions in both originating loans and attracting deposits 
this competition resulted in lower pricing for new loans which encompass both interest rates and fees charged 
additionally  despite reductions in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve totaling basis points since september  inb was not able to fully lower its deposit rates in step with these reductions in order to remain competitive with other financial institutions in attracting deposits 
at december   inb had million of nonperforming assets 
all of the above factors contributed to a decrease in inb s net interest margin to in from in inb relies heavily on certificates of deposit time deposits as its main source of funds 
consolidated deposits amounted to billion at december  and time deposits represented or billion of those deposits  down from at december   which reflects an increase in money market deposit accounts in time deposits of  or more at december  totaled million  compared to million at december   and included million and million of brokered deposits at each date  respectively

inb must maintain its status as a well capitalized insured depository institution in order to solicit and accept  renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction 
time deposits are the only deposit accounts offered by inb that have stated maturity dates 
these deposits are generally considered to be rate sensitive and have a higher cost than deposits with no stated maturities  such as checking  savings and money market accounts

imc s lending business also depends on its ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the yields earned on its mortgage loans and the rates paid on its debentures issued to the public 
since early  competitive market conditions and lower pricing for new loans have decreased imc s loan originations significantly from its historical levels  and imc originated only one loan in as a result  imc has been applying the proceeds from loan repayments to redeem its outstanding debentures  in many cases prior to contractual maturity 
to the extent that current market conditions continue to exist  it is likely that the level of imc s loan originations will be modest  if any in  and imc will continue to apply the proceeds received from its maturing loans to the repayment of its outstanding debentures

regulatory capital inb is subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
as disclosed in detail elsewhere in this report  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and other bank regulatory agencies use five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized to determine various matters  including prompt corrective action and each institution s fdic deposit insurance premiums 
these categories involve quantitative measures of a bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on inb s and the company s consolidated financial statements 
inb is required to maintain regulatory defined minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratio levels of at least  and  respectively 
at december  and  inb believes that it met its capital adequacy requirements and is a well capitalized institution as defined in the regulations  which require minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based ratios of  and  respectively 
as of the date of filing of this report on form k  management is not aware of any conditions or events that would have changed inb s designation as a well capitalized institution 

table of contents information regarding inb s regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets ibc on a consolidated basis is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements administered by the frb 
these guidelines require a ratio of tier or core capital  as defined in the guidelines  to total risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
the guidelines also require a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total average assets of not less than 
at december  and  ibc believes that it met its capital adequacy requirements 
information regarding consolidated regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital includes million of qualifying trust preferred securities  which represent outstanding debentures issued to intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v by ibc  net of the ibc s investments in those trusts 
the inclusion of these securities in tier capital is currently limited to of core capital elements  as defined in the fdic regulations 
additionally  at december   tier capital included million of cumulative perpetual preferred stock sold to the us treasury 
through march   bank holding companies bhcs generally must calculate their tier capital on a basis that limits the aggregate amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities to percent of the sum of qualifying common stockholder s equity  qualifying noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  qualifying minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying trust preferred securities 
amounts of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities in excess of this limit may be included in tier capital 
beginning march   qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock excluding senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury  all of which qualifies as tier capital without restriction and qualifying trust preferred securities  as well as certain types of minority interest  are limited to percent of the sum of core capital elements net of goodwill 
the company does not have any goodwill or minority interests 
additionally  the excess amounts of restricted core capital elements in the form of qualifying trust preferred securities included in tier capital are limited to percent of tier capital net of goodwill 
however  amounts in excess of this limit will still be taken into account in the overall assessment of an organization s funding and financial condition 
in the last five years before the underlying subordinated note matures  the associated trust preferred securities must be treated as limited life preferred stock 
thus  in the last five years of the life of the note  the outstanding amount of trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital  subject  together with subordinated debt and other limited life preferred stock  to a limit of percent of tier capital 
during this period  the trust preferred securities will be amortized out of tier capital by one fifth of the original amount less redemptions each year and excluded totally from tier capital during the last year of life of the underlying note 

table of contents as of december  and  assuming ibc s eligible trust preferred securities were excluded from its tier capital and instead included in its tier capital  ibc would still have exceeded the well capitalized threshold under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a further discussion of the trust preferred securities 
asset and liability management interest rate risk arises from differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on its net interest income and capital 
the company has not engaged in and accordingly has no present risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the company uses gap analysis  which measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor its interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
callable features of certain assets and liabilities  in addition to the foregoing  may also cause actual experience to vary from the analysis 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to in the industry as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different from those assumed in the gap analysis 
many of the company s floating rate loans have a floor  or minimum rate  that is determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
this feature reduces the unfavorable effect on interest income of a falling rate environment because the interest rates on such loans do not reset downward 
however  the company may nonetheless experience loan prepayments  the amount of which cannot be predicted  and reinvestment risk associated with the investment of the resulting proceeds 
the number of floating rate loans in the company s loan portfolio has decreased significantly over the last two years 
at december   of the loan portfolio contained loans with fixed rates of interest 
there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may not adversely impact the company s earnings and capital  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 

table of contents the table below summarizes interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   that are scheduled to mature or reprice within the periods shown 
in thousands months months over years over years total loans securities held to maturity short term investments frb and fhlb stock total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts interest checking deposits savings deposits money market deposits certificates of deposit total deposits fhlb advances debentures and mortgage note payable accrued interest on all borrowed funds total borrowed funds total rate sensitive liabilities gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets significant assumptions used in preparing the gap table above follow floating rate loans and debentures payable are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature 
fixed rate loans  debentures payable and fhlb advances are scheduled  including repayments  according to their contractual maturities 
certain debentures that have been identified to be repaid prior to their contractual maturity are scheduled according to the repayment date 
deferred loan fees and the effect of possible loan prepayments are excluded from the analysis 
nonaccrual loans of million and foreclosed real estate of million are also excluded from the table although some portion is expected to return to an interest earning status in the near term 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their contractual maturity or the date in which the interest rate is scheduled to increase 
the effects of possible prepayments that may result from the issuer s right to call a security before its contractual maturity date are not considered in the analysis 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts and certificates of deposit are scheduled according to their contractual maturity dates 
the company s balance sheet became more interest rate sensitive during  with increased exposure to a rising interest rate environment 
at december   the company s interest bearing liabilities exceeded its interest earning assets that are scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
this one year interest rate sensitivity gap amounted to a negative million  or of total assets  at december   compared to a negative gap of million  or of total assets at december  the company is currently liability sensitive  indicating that its interest bearing liabilities would generally reprice with changes in interest rates more rapidly than its interest earning assets 
the change in the gap from december  was due to the continued runoff of accruing loans with a repricing or remaining maturity of less than one year being replaced with new fixed rate loans with maturities averaging years and purchases of security investments with longer term maturities 
the new loans and securities have been funded through an increase in money market and time deposit accounts with maturities of one year or less 
in addition  the scheduled repricing of certain trust preferred capital securities from fixed to floating rate and the scheduled early repayment of certain debentures of imc with original maturities of greater than one year have also contributed to the increased negative gap 

table of contents inb s deposit flows and deposit rates offered are monitored weekly 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  inb began concentrating on attracting longer term deposits by being very competitive with the rates offered on these products and less so on the rates offered for shorter term deposits 
inb also utilized longer term fhlb advances with maturities of up to five years to lock in favorable borrowing rates at the time 
in  inb experienced competitive market conditions in both originating loans and attracting deposits 
this competition resulted in lower pricing for new loans originated which encompass both interest rates and fees charged 
at the same time  despite reductions in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve totaling basis points since september  inb was not able to fully lower its deposit rates in step with the federal reserve in order to remain competitive with other financial institutions in attracting deposits 
it should be noted that for purposes of computing the one year interest rate sensitivity gap  all deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts as noted in footnote to the gap table 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
depositors may not necessarily immediately withdraw funds in the event deposit rates offered by inb did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the one year interest rate sensitivity gap would have computed to be a negative at december   compared to a positive at december   which would have resulted in a significantly lower level of perceived interest rate sensitivity 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of the company than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit taking and borrowing activities 
the company has not engaged in and accordingly has no present risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as of december  and  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
management actively monitors and manages the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital 
to this regard  inb  whose assets represent of total consolidated assets  performs internal analyses by preparing interest rate shock scenarios representing the effects of specific interest rate changes on its net interest income and capital to its basic one year gap model as a quantitative tool to measure the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market interest rates 
inb also engages an outside consultant to prepare quarterly reports using an earnings simulation model to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on its projected net interest income and net income over projected periods 
these computations rely on various assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and composition  and the pricing and repricing and maturity characteristics of the balance sheet
