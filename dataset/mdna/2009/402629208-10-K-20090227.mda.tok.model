table of contents a effective january   we began expensing the costs associated with drydocks 
previously  these costs were capitalized and amortized over months 
as a result of this change  in we recorded a non cash cumulative effect charge of million  net of tax per basic and diluted common share 
b see note to our consolidated financial statements income taxes 
c earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding 
d ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest expense  interest income  income tax benefit provision  and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting ebitda for certain items that we believe are non cash or non operational  consisting of i cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  ii debt refinancing costs  iii loss from unconsolidated ventures  iv minority interests  and v other income expense  net 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow data  a measure of liquidity or an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because they are widely used by security analysts  creditors  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
this information is a material component of certain financial covenants in debt obligations 
failure to comply with the financial covenants could result in the imposition of restrictions on our financial flexibility 
when viewed with gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe the ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculation provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt and meet our ongoing liquidity requirements 
ebitda is also a financial metric used by management as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations 
however  because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies or comparable for other purposes 
also  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as non gaap financial measures  have material limitations as compared to cash flow provided by operating activities 
ebitda does not reflect the future payments for capital expenditures  financing related charges and deferred income taxes that may be required as normal business operations 
management compensates for these limitations by using our gaap results to supplement the ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands net income loss interest expense interest income income tax benefit provision depreciation and amortization ebitda adjustments cumulative effect of change in accounting principle debt refinancing costs other adjusted ebitda includes foreign currency transaction adjustments 
e includes managed vessels in addition to those that are owned and chartered at the end of the applicable period

table of contents f average number of vessels is calculated based on the aggregate number of vessel days available during each period divided by the number of calendar days in such period
