item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to drive the us economy 
we are the nation s largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone  sand and gravel a major producer of asphalt mix and concrete and a leading producer of cement in florida 
segments our four operating segments are organized around our principal product lines aggregates  asphalt mix  concrete and cement 
for reporting purposes  we have combined our asphalt mix and concrete segments into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses exhibit similar economic characteristics  product processes  types and classes of customer  methods of distribution and regulatory environments 
management reviews earnings for the product line reporting units principally at the gross profit level 
our aggregates segment mines  processes  distributes and sells crushed stone  sand and gravel 
our asphalt mix and concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix  ready mixed concrete  concrete block  prestressed concrete beams 
table of contents and precast concrete  and sells other building materials 
our cement segment mines limestone feedstock and produces and sells portland cement and masonry cement 
it also imports  grinds  blends and sells cement and slag  and produces and sells calcium products 
products we operate primarily in the united states and our principal product aggregates is consumed in virtually all types of publicly and privately funded construction 
during  we shipped million tons into states  the district of columbia  the bahamas  canada  the cayman islands  chile and mexico from aggregates production facilities and sales yards 
our ten largest states  measured by our aggregates shipments  accounted for of our total aggregates shipments 
reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business 
our current estimate of billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase of billion tons since the end of we believe that these reserves are sufficient to last  on average  years at current annual production rates 
while aggregates are our primary business  we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products  such as asphalt mix and concrete  can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns 
as such  we evaluate the structural characteristics of individual markets to determine the appropriateness of an aggregates only or vertical integration strategy 
for a discussion of end markets  competition and customers  and seasonality and cyclical nature of our business  see item business above 
other on november   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of florida rock industries  inc florida rock  a leading producer of construction aggregates  cement  concrete and concrete products in the southeastern and mid atlantic states  in exchange for cash and stock of approximately billion based on the closing price of vulcan common stock on november  the acquisition further diversified the geographic scope of vulcan s operations  expanding our presence in attractive florida markets and in other high growth southeastern and mid atlantic states  and adding approximately billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves and billion tons of proven and probable cement and calcium carbonate reserves in many markets where reserves are increasingly scarce 
in june  we sold our chemicals business as presented in note to the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  its results are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
in the discussion that follows  continuing operations consist of our construction materials business  which is organized into three reportable segments aggregates  asphalt mix and concrete  and cement 
the results of operations discussed below include florida rock for the periods from november  through december  and january  through december  discontinued operations  which consist of our former chemicals business  are discussed separately 
in the comparative analysis  segment revenue at the product line level includes intersegment sales 
net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost 
this presentation is consistent with the basis on which management reviews results of operations 
results of operations versus the financial and economic turmoil in the us is unprecedented and the external factors affecting the construction industry continue to present unique challenges for our business 
aggregates demand and our shipments have declined for three consecutive years 
our legacy aggregates shipments in were down from the peak level achieved in throughout  we focused aggressively on controlling costs while realizing higher pricing for our products reflecting their value in the attractive markets we serve 
we reduced our operating costs by limiting operating hours  streamlining our work force  and focusing on production efficiencies in the face of a sharp decline in demand for our products 
as a result of these actions  the cash earnings per ton of aggregates in our legacy operations increased over from the level  which was a year of peak demand for aggregates 
the cash earnings generated on each ton of aggregates sold in was higher than in any other period in our history 
the 
table of contents increased level of unit profitability supports our optimism about the earnings potential of our business when demand begins to recover 
net sales for of billion reflected an increase of from the prior year 
this increase resulted from the inclusion of the former florida rock operations for the full year 
volumes were adversely affected by the continuing sharp downturn in construction activity 
pricing for our products remained strong and helped offset the earnings effects of lower volumes  higher energy related costs  increased interest expense  as well as higher noncash charges for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the unit cost for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt increased and  respectively  from in our legacy operations 
net loss per diluted share was in compared with net earnings of per diluted share in the results include an estimated million  or per diluted share  after tax goodwill impairment charge referable to our cement segment in florida 
the results also include net earnings per diluted share of referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition 
results in include net earnings per diluted share of referable to the sale of real estate in california  net of the related incentives 
additionally  the higher energy related costs lowered earnings per diluted share compared with aggregates segment revenues decreased million to  million compared with  as the effect of lower volumes from legacy operations more than offset the effect of improved pricing and the inclusion of a full year of sales from the former florida rock aggregates operations 
compared with  total aggregates shipments declined while the average selling price increased 
most of our geographic markets reported double digit percentage declines in aggregates volumes except for markets in texas and along the central gulf coast 
gross profit for the aggregates segment of million declined from as the earnings effects from the decline in legacy vulcan shipments and sharply higher unit cost for diesel fuel more than offset the improvement in aggregates pricing and the inclusion of earnings from the former florida rock operations 
asphalt mix and concrete segment revenues increased million to  million compared with shipments of asphalt mix declined in while concrete shipments increased significantly due to inclusion of a full year of sales from the former florida rock concrete operations 
asphalt mix prices increased from while the unit cost of liquid asphalt rose 
asphalt mix earnings decreased due principally to higher costs for liquid asphalt 
compared with  gross profit for the asphalt mix and concrete segment decreased to million in revenues and gross profit for the cement segment were million and million  respectively 
the cement segment was acquired in november as part of the florida rock acquisition  and therefore  no comparable revenues or earnings were reported for the first months of selling  administrative and general expenses increased million from this increase was primarily attributable to including a full year of expenses related to the former florida rock businesses  million of expense related to the fair market value of donated property and million related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related consolidation of certain administrative support functions 
during  we recorded an estimated million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement operations in florida  representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit 
there were no comparable charges in during  we recorded a million pretax gain referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the department of justice of the florida rock acquisition 
during  we recorded a million pretax gain  net of transaction costs  on the sale of real estate in california 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
in addition to the items noted above  higher interest expense contributed to this decrease in earnings 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of florida rock 

table of contents earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for versus are summarized below in millions of dollars lower aggregates earnings due to lower volumes higher selling prices higher costs lower asphalt mix and concrete earnings higher cement earnings higher selling  administrative and general expenses goodwill impairment cement estimated gain on divestitures gain on sale of california real estate higher interest expense  net all other earnings loss from continuing operations decreased to per diluted share in from per diluted share in the goodwill impairment charge accounted for per diluted share of the decline 
versus consolidated net sales increased from the prior year to a record billion 
continued strong growth in aggregates pricing during contributed to an increase in operating earnings year over year despite lower sales volumes across all principal product lines 
the pricing momentum achieved in and continued in  reflecting an environment that recognizes the high cost of replacing aggregates reserves in high growth metropolitan markets 
aggregates segment revenues were  million in  an increase of from  in the prior year 
excluding the effects of the florida rock acquisition  revenues for vulcan s legacy aggregates segment declined slightly as lower shipments were substantially offset by a increase in average selling prices 
aggregates shipments during decreased approximately from levels  primarily as a result of lower demand in the residential construction market 
the impact of residential construction activity on shipments was partially offset by increased levels of highway construction and nonresidential building construction 
gross profit for the aggregates segment increased million  or  over unit costs for aggregates produced at legacy vulcan operations increased in due principally to the effects of higher depreciation expense referable to recently completed capital projects coupled with a reduction in production volumes 
additionally  unit costs for energy  such as diesel fuel and electric power  increased by approximately 
higher costs for diesel fuel lowered gross profit from legacy vulcan aggregates operations approximately million 
revenues for the asphalt mix and concrete segment increased slightly to million in as compared to million in excluding the effects of the florida rock acquisition  revenues for vulcan s legacy asphalt mix and concrete segment decreased by million  or 
revenues for asphalt mix improved due to higher pricing  which more than offset a decline in volumes 
concrete pricing improved  but was more than offset by a decline in volumes 
gross profit for the asphalt mix and concrete segment was mixed  with asphalt mix improving and concrete declining 
higher pricing for asphalt mix more than offset the lower volumes and higher prices for aggregates supplied internally 
unit costs for liquid asphalt remained at high levels in with little change when compared with the prior year 
higher pricing for concrete was more than offset by lower volumes and higher raw material costs  including aggregates supplied internally 
revenues and gross profit for the cement segment  all of which was acquired in the florida rock transaction  were immaterial to results of operations 
operating earnings improved to million  a increase over the increase in operating earnings was due to the aforementioned higher pricing for each of our principal products and a million gain on sale of real estate in california during the first quarter of prior year results include a million gain referable to the 
table of contents sale of contractual rights to mine a quarry in atlanta  georgia 
these favorable contributions to operating earnings more than offset the effects of lower production levels  an increase in energy costs and florida rock transaction and integration related costs 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
the earnings include a pretax gain of million related to the increase in the carrying value of the contingent ecu electrochemical unit earn out received in connection with the sale of our chemicals business 
the corresponding pretax gain from the ecu earn out was million 
an increase of million in interest expense also contributed to the decline in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for versus are summarized below in millions of dollars legacy vulcan operations higher aggregates earnings higher asphalt mix and concrete earnings higher selling  administrative and general expenses gain on sale of california real estate gain on sale of contractual rights to mine lower gain on contingent ecu earn out all other legacy florida rock acquisition earnings from continuing operations decreased to per diluted share from per diluted share in earnings per share in include the effects of the florida rock acquisition  including operating results  interest expense associated with the financing of the transaction  additional shares issued as part of the transaction  one time expenses associated with executing the transaction and integrating the businesses  and depreciation associated with the write up of assets to fair value in accordance with purchase accounting 
specifically  diluted earnings per share include approximately per share due to one time transaction related items  per share related to higher interest expense attributable to the additional debt incurred to fund the transaction  and per share due to the effect of additional shares issued as purchase consideration in the transaction 
selling  administrative and general selling  administrative and general expenses were million in as compared with million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following including a full year of expenses related to the former florida rock businesses  million of expense related to the fair market value of donated property a partially offsetting amount is recorded in gain on sale of property  plant equipment and businesses  net as noted below  and million related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related consolidation of certain administrative support functions 
excluding the effects of the aforementioned items  selling  administrative and general expenses decreased approximately million or compared with the prior year  primarily as a result of lower performance based compensation 
selling  administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net sales were in  up from the prior year s 
in  selling  administrative and general expenses increased million or from the level 
this increase was partially attributable to selling  administrative and general expenses associated with the newly acquired florida rock operations as well as transaction and integration related costs 
excluding the effects of florida rock  during selling  administrative and general expenses increased approximately over the level 
goodwill impairment during  we recorded an estimated million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement segment in florida  representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit 
these operations were acquired as part of the florida rock transaction in november there were no charges for goodwill impairment in and for additional details regarding this impairment  see the goodwill and goodwill impairment critical accounting policy below 

table of contents gain on sale of property  plant equipment and businesses  net during  we recorded gains on the sale of property  plant equipment and businesses of million  an increase of million from the prior year

interest income in increased million from the level 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared with the amount of million 
this increase in interest expense was due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of florida rock 
excluding capitalized interest credits  gross interest expense for was million compared with million in and million in interest expense was million in compared with the amount of million 
the million increase was due primarily to approximately billion in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to acquire florida rock 
income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was  up percentage points from in this increase principally reflected the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  our effective tax rate for continuing operations was  up percentage points from the rate for continuing operations was down percentage points from the rate of 
this decrease principally reflected a reduction in state income taxes and an increase in the tax benefit from contributions 
discontinued operations in  we sold substantially all the assets of our chemicals business  known as vulcan chemicals  to basic chemicals  a subsidiary of occidental chemical corporation 
the purchaser also assumed certain liabilities related to the chemicals business  including the obligation to monitor and remediate all releases of hazardous materials at or from the wichita  geismar and port edwards plant facilities 
the decision to sell the chemicals business was based on our desire to focus our resources on the construction materials business 
financial results referable to our chemicals business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the transaction  which was structured as a sale of assets  involved initial cash proceeds  contingent future proceeds under two earn out provisions and the transfer of certain liabilities 
at the closing date  the fair value of the 
table of contents consideration received in connection with the sale of the chemicals business  including anticipated cash flows from the two earn out agreements  was expected to exceed the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold 
however  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  since the proceeds under the earn out agreements were contingent in nature  no gain was recognized on the chemicals sale and the value recorded at the june  closing date referable to these two earn outs was limited to million 
furthermore  under sab topic z  upward adjustments to the fair value of the ecu earn out subsequent to closing  which totaled million  were recorded in continuing operations  and therefore did not contribute to the gain or loss on the sale of the chemicals business 
ultimately  gain or loss on disposal will be recognized to the extent future cash receipts under the cp hydrochlorocarbon product hcc fa earn out related to the remaining performance period from january  to december  exceed or fall short of its million december  carrying amount 
pretax operating results from discontinued operations were a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in these operating losses reflect charges related to general and product liability costs  including legal defense costs  and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals businesses 
for additional information regarding discontinued operations  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting changes fas on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of fas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the adoption of fas for financial assets and liabilities had no effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
additionally  its adoption resulted in no material changes in our valuation methodologies  techniques or assumptions for such assets and liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under the caption fair value measurements for disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities pursuant to the requirements of fas fas on january   we adopted the measurement date provision of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r fas 
in addition to the recognition provisions which we adopted december   fas requires an employer to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its year end balance sheet 
this requirement was effective for fiscal years ending after december  upon adopting the measurement date provision  we remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations as of january   pursuant to the transition requirements of fas the transition adjustment resulted in an increase to noncurrent assets of million  an increase to noncurrent liabilities of million  an increase to deferred tax liabilities of million  a decrease to retained earnings of million and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  of million 
liquidity and capital resources we believe we have sufficient financial resources  including cash provided by operating activities  unused bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets  to fund business requirements in the future  including debt service obligations  cash contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividend payments 
in february  we issued million of long term debt as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements and used the proceeds to reduce short term bank borrowings  thereby freeing up a like amount of liquidity under our bank lines of credit 
debt reduction and achieving target debt ratios remain a priority use of cash flows 
we expect to reduce total debt by million during  excluding any earnings effect from the economic stimulus plan 
for the full year  we expect capital spending  excluding acquisitions  to approximate million  down sharply from the million spent in 
table of contents cash flows net cash provided by operating activities including discontinued operations decreased million to million during as compared with a total of million in net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses related to goodwill impairment and depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization accounted for million of the decrease 
in addition  certain assets were required to be disposed of as a condition to the acquisition of florida rock note to the consolidated financial statements 
the reclassification of gains resulting from these dispositions and other net gains on sale of property  plant equipment contributed an additional million to the year over year decrease in cash provided by operating activities as the associated cash received is presented as a component of investing activities 
reductions in trade payables and other accruals accounted for an additional million decrease in cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities including discontinued operations totaled million in  an increase of million or as compared with net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses related to depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization increased million when compared with the prior year 
comparative changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities contributed approximately million to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities  primarily resulting from decreases in accounts receivable and income tax liabilities 
partially offsetting these favorable changes to operating cash flows was a reclassification to investing activities of million related to net gains on sales of property  plant equipment and contractual rights 
net cash used for investing activities totaled million in compared with  million in the  million decrease was largely attributable to the acquisition of florida rock in  which required cash payments of  million  net of cash acquired and including vulcan s direct transaction costs 
a reduction in capital spending of million from the prior year reflects our focus on utilizing cash to reduce debt 
proceeds from the sale of businesses required to be divested as part of the florida rock acquisition contributed to a million increase in proceeds from the sale of businesses  partially offset by a million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property  plant equipment 
additionally  million in assets held in money market and other money funds were reclassified from cash equivalents to medium term investments during  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used for financing activities totaled million in  as compared with net cash provided by financing activities during of  million 
the  million decrease in cash generated from financing activities was due primarily to a  million change in net short term borrowing activity  an increase in payments of short term debt and current maturities of million  and a million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  net of discounts and debt issuance costs 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in of million were used to pay down short term borrowings drawn during to fund the florida rock acquisition note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting these decreases in cash from financing activities were cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to pay out a reasonable share of net cash provided by operating activities as dividends  consistent on average with the payout record of past years  while maintaining debt ratios within what we believe to be prudent and generally acceptable limits 
working capital working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  totaled million at december   an increase of million from the  million level at december  the increase in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease of  million in short term borrowings partially offset by an increase in current maturities of million 
weakness in demand for our products resulted in a million year over year decrease in net accounts and notes receivable  offset by a related decrease in trade payables and accruals of million 
as of december   we have  million in bank lines of credit  of which  million was drawn 
working capital totaled  million at december   a decrease of  million from the million level at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the use of cash and short term 
table of contents borrowings to fund the acquisition of florida rock 
excluding the effects of the change in short term borrowings  working capital increased million  primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable  offset in part by current trade payables and accrued liabilities  acquired in the florida rock transaction 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  which exclude business acquisitions  totaled million in  down million from the level of million 
during  we completed three major aggregates plant rebuilds and continued the multi year expansion project at our newberry cement plant 
as explained in the financial terminology  we classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project 
in  profit adding projects accounted for million or of the spending 
commitments for capital expenditures were million at december  we expect to fund these commitments using available cash  internally generated cash flow or additional borrowings 
acquisitions and divestitures in  the total purchase price cash and stock consideration paid of acquisitions amounted to million  down significantly from the prior year  which included  million related to the florida rock acquisition the largest in our history 
as a result of the florida rock acquisition  we entered into a final judgment with the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj that required us to divest nine florida rock and legacy vulcan sites 
we completed these divestitures in resulting in the acquisition of several sites through exchanges with various entities  as follows 
in a transaction with luck stone corporation  we acquired two aggregates production facilities in virginia and cash in exchange for two florida rock sites in virginia  an aggregates production facility and a distribution yard 
in a transaction with martin marietta materials  inc martin marietta  we received cash and acquired an aggregates production facility near sacramento  california  real property with proven and permitted reserves adjacent to one of our aggregates production facilities in san antonio  texas  and fee ownership of property at one of our aggregates production facilities in north carolina that we had previously leased from martin marietta 
in return  we divested four aggregates production facilities and a greenfield undeveloped aggregates site located in georgia  and an aggregates production facility located in tennessee 
two of the divested sites included in the transaction with martin marietta were owned by vulcan prior to our acquisition of florida rock 
accordingly  during  we recognized a pretax gain of million on the sale of these assets 
in a separate transaction  we sold our interest in an aggregates production facility in georgia to the concrete company  which had been the joint venture partner with florida rock in this operation 
in addition to the acquisitions obtained in the aforementioned exchanges  other acquisitions completed during included four aggregates production facilities  one asphalt mix plant  a recycling facility and vacant land located in california  an aggregates production facility in illinois and our former joint venture partner s interest in an aggregates production facility in tennessee 
these acquisitions cost approximately million total cash and stock consideration paid including acquisition costs and net of acquired cash 
the acquisitions included the florida rock acquisition  an aggregates production facility in illinois and an aggregates production facility in north carolina 
in addition to these acquisitions  during  we acquired an aggregates production facility in alabama in exchange for two aggregates production facilities in illinois 
the florida rock acquisition exclusive of divestitures required pursuant to an agreement with the department of justice consisted of aggregates production facilities  aggregates sales yards  concrete plants  cement plant  calcium products plant and cement grinding facilities located in the southeastern and mid atlantic states 
proven and probable reserves aggregates  calcium products and cement acquired in the florida rock transaction amounted to approximately billion tons

the number of shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the board of directors was  as of december  new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued fas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
as previously noted  on january   we adopted 
table of contents fas with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of fas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by fsp fas fas applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  accordingly  it does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
fair value under fas is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  a reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequent basis  fsp fas requires companies to adopt the provisions of fas for fiscal years beginning after november  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of fas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities on january  to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity

r  business combinations 
fas r  which requires the acquirer in a business combination to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value 
fas r applies whenever an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses 
additionally  the new standard requires that in a business combination acquisition related costs  such as legal and due diligence costs  be expensed as incurred 
acquirer shares issued as consideration be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date 
contingent consideration arrangements be included in the purchase price allocation at their acquisition date fair value 
with certain exceptions  pre acquisition contingencies be recorded at fair value 
negative goodwill be recognized as income rather than as a pro rata reduction of the value allocated to particular assets 
restructuring plans be recorded in purchase accounting only if the requirements in fasb statement no

fas r requires prospective application for business combinations consummated in fiscal years beginning on or after december   we will adopt fas r on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas 
the standard requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests  sometimes referred to as minority interests  in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
noncontrolling interest under fas is defined as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
the standard requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of consolidated net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest should be presented separately on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings 
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary should be measured at fair value  and a gain or loss recognized accordingly

the additional disclosure requirements of this fsp are effective for fiscal years ending after december  critical accounting policies we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of these policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial 
table of contents statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
our actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  as of january for the recent completed fiscal year  or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
as of december   goodwill totaled  million as compared with  million at december  total goodwill represented of total assets at december   compared with and as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted from a million reduction in the florida rock acquisition goodwill as a result of the final purchase price allocation for more details  see note to the consolidated financial statements as well as a goodwill impairment charge of million as noted below 
the increase in resulted primarily from the preliminary purchase price allocation for the november florida rock acquisition 
the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
we have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines aggregates  asphalt mix  concrete and cement 
within these four operating segments  we have identified reporting units based primarily on geographical location 
the carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning assets and liabilities  including goodwill  to those reporting units as of the january measurement date 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach  which involves discounting estimated future cash flows  and a market approach  which involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies 
we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models 
to substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations  we reconcile the implied fair values to market capitalization 
the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of january  indicated that the carrying value of our cement reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
based on the preliminary results of the second step of the impairment test  we estimated that the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting unit was impaired 
therefore  we recorded a million pretax goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december  the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of january  and indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values and  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
accordingly  there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended december  and 
table of contents determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects  which may result from a decline in our stock price  a change in market conditions  market trends  interest rates or other factors outside of our control  or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units  which could result in an impairment charge in the future 
for additional information regarding goodwill  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long term assumptions 
our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends  which may be different from actual results 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
for additional information regarding long lived assets and intangible assets  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  respectively 
reclamation costs reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets 
additionally  reclamation costs resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease 
the obligation  which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows  is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses 
this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 
in determining the fair value of the obligation  we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin 
this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement 
once calculated  this cost is then discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit adjusted  risk free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement 
in estimating the settlement date  we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date 
if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates  we use a weighted average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative 
reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date 
additionally  reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date 
examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease 
examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility

 employers accounting for pensions fas  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions fas  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fas when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets we project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term asset allocation of the plan 
these projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs 
rate of compensation increase for salary related plans only  we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits we project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits 
the provisions of fas and fas provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
fas see note to the consolidated financial statements  caption fas for a detailed description partially supersedes the delayed recognition principles of fas and fas by requiring that differences between actual results and expected or estimated results be recognized in full in other comprehensive income 
amounts recognized in other comprehensive income pursuant to fas are reclassified to earnings in accordance with the recognition principles of fas and fas upon our january  adoption of the measurement date provisions of fas see note to the consolidated financial statements  caption fas we changed our measurement date for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to december previously  we had accelerated our measurement date to november annually  we review our assumptions related to the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 
in selecting the discount rate  we consider fixed income security yields  specifically high quality bonds 
at december   the discount rate for our plans increased to from at november  for purposes of determining our liability under fas pensions and increased to from at november  for purposes of determining our liability under fas other postretirement benefits 
an analysis of the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high quality bonds is used in the selection of the discount rate 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider past performance and long term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
at december   the expected return on plan assets remained 
in projecting the rate of compensation increase  we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   the inflation component of the assumed rate of compensation increase remained 
in addition  based on future expectations of merit and productivity increases  the weighted average component of the salary increase assumption remained 
in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits  we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends 
at december   our assumed rate of increase in the per capita 
table of contents cost of covered healthcare benefits increased to for  decreasing each year until reaching in and remaining level thereafter 
changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities  and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost

earnings on assets above or below the expected return are reflected in the calculation of pension expense through the calculation of the market related value  which recognizes changes in fair value averaged on a systematic basis over five years 
as a result of the june sale of our chemicals business  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  we recognized a settlement charge of million representing an acceleration of unrecognized losses due to lump sum payments to certain retirees from our former chemicals business 
during  we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately million compared with million and million  respectively  in this increase in pension expense is primarily related to the asset losses during normal cash payments made for pension benefits in under the unfunded plans are estimated at million 
we expect to make approximately million in required contributions to the funded pension plans during  all of which relates to the pension plan assumed in the florida rock acquisition 
the pension protection act of ppa  enacted on august   significantly changed the funding requirements after for single employer defined benefit pension plans  among other provisions 
funding requirements under the ppa are largely based on a plan s funded status  with faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses 
this act did not have a material impact on the funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plans during while negative returns on plan assets in have diminished our plans funded status  including the write down in the estimated fair value of certain assets invested at westridge capital management  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements  we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration

table of contents environmental compliance we incur environmental compliance costs  which include maintenance and operating costs for pollution control facilities  the cost of ongoing monitoring programs  the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs 
environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or that relate to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with our capitalization policy 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues are expensed 
costs associated with environmental assessments and remediation efforts are accrued when management determines that a liability is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
at the early stages of a remediation effort  environmental remediation liabilities are not easily identified  due in part to the uncertainties of varying factors 
the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  we accrue the most likely amount 
in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely  the minimum loss in the range is accrued 
as of december   the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range was million 
accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers 
our safety  health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates  including key assumptions  for accruing environmental compliance costs  however  a number of factors  including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress  may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs 
for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
claims and litigation including self insurance we are involved with claims and litigation  including items covered under our self insurance program 
we are self insured for losses related to workers compensation up to million per occurrence and automotive and general product liability up to million per occurrence 
we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these deductible levels 
under our self insurance program  we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses  including future legal defense costs  based on actuarial studies 
certain claims and litigation costs  due to their unique nature  are not included in our actuarial studies 
we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss  and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
for matters not included in our actuarial studies  legal defense costs are accrued when incurred 
accrued liabilities under our self insurance program were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
approximately million of the increase from to relates to liabilities acquired in the florida rock acquisition 
accrued liabilities for self insurance reserves as of december  were discounted at 
as of december   the undiscounted amount was million as compared with the discounted liability of million 
expected payments undiscounted for the next five years are projected as follows million  million  million  million and million 
significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses  and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
for interim financial reporting  we estimate the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the year progresses  we refine the estimates of the year s taxable income as new information becomes available  including year to date financial results 
this continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income  and we will record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future taxable income  mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of a realization of a deferred tax asset 
to the extent recovery is unlikely  a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to make a determination that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes  special areas  does not require us income taxes to be provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we periodically evaluate our investment strategies with respect to each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and  accordingly  whether us income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin effective january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with fin  we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate 
favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent 
however  if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position  the liability is presented as current 
we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 
our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion 
the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings 
due to the magnitude of the impact of statutory depletion on our effective tax rate and taxable income  a significant portion of the financial reporting risk is related to this estimate 
the american jobs creation act of created a new deduction for certain domestic production activities as described in section of the internal revenue code 
generally  this deduction  subject to certain limitations  was set at for  in and will remain at through and reaches in and thereafter

net assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of the combination  and include tangible and intangible items 
capital employed the sum of interest bearing debt  other noncurrent liabilities and shareholders equity 
average capital employed is a month average 
capital expenditures capital expenditures include capitalized replacements of and additions to property  plant equipment  including capitalized leases  renewals and betterments 
capital expenditures exclude the property  plant equipment obtained by business acquisitions 
we classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project expenditures 
thus  a project is classified entirely as a replacement if that is the principal reason for making the expenditure even though the project may involve some cost saving and or capacity improvement aspects 
likewise  a profit adding project is classified entirely as such if the principal reason for making the expenditure is to add operating facilities at new locations which occasionally replace facilities at old locations  to add product lines  to expand the capacity of existing facilities  to reduce costs  to increase mineral reserves  to improve products  etc 
capital expenditures classified as environmental control do not reflect those expenditures for environmental control activities  including industrial health programs that are expensed currently 
such expenditures are made on a continuing basis and at significant levels

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
in order to manage or reduce these market risks  we may utilize derivative financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk due to our various credit facilities and long term debt instruments 
at times  we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk 
in december  we issued million of year floating variable rate notes that bear interest at month libor plus per annum 
concurrently  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a counterparty in the stated notional amount of million and a contractual term coinciding with the maturity of the million of year floating rate notes 
at december   we recognized a liability of million  equal to the fair value of this swap included in other noncurrent liabilities and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million  net of tax of million  equal to the highly effective portion of this swap 
at december   we recognized a liability of million equal to the fair value of this swap included in other noncurrent liabilities  and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million  net of tax of million  equal to the highly effective portion of this swap 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in libor as a result of this interest rate swap agreement 
a decline in interest rates of percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately million 
at december   the estimated fair market value of our long term debt instruments including current maturities was  million as compared with a book value of  million 
the effect of a decline in interest rates of percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately million 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
these economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high quality bonds  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 
the impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section of this annual report
