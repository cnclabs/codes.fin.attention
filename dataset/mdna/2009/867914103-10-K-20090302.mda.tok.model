this narrative will assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
when we refer to suntrust  the company  we  our and us in this narrative  we mean suntrust banks  inc and subsidiaries consolidated 
effective october   national commerce financial corporation ncf merged with suntrust 
the results of operations for ncf were included with our results beginning october  additionally  effective may   we acquired gb t bancshares  inc gb t and the results of operations for gb t were included with our results beginning on that date 
periods prior to the acquisition date do not reflect the impact of the merger 
in the md a  net interest income  net interest margin  and the efficiency ratio are presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis and the quarterly ratios are presented on an annualized basis 
the fte basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
we believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
we also present diluted earnings per common share excluding merger expense and an efficiency ratio excluding merger charges related to the ncf acquisition 
we believe the exclusion of the merger charges  which represent incremental costs to integrate ncf s operations  is more reflective of normalized operations 
the merger charges related to the acquisition of gb t were insignificant 
additionally  we present a return on average realized common shareholders equity  as well as a return on average common shareholders equity roe 
we also present a return on average assets less net realized and unrealized securities gains losses and a return on average total assets roa 
the return on average realized common shareholders equity and return on average assets less net realized and unrealized securities gains losses exclude realized securities gains and losses and the coca cola company coke dividend  from the numerator  and net unrealized securities gains from the denominator 
we present a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio  which excludes the cost of and the other effects of intangible assets resulting from merger and acquisition m a activity 
we believe these measures are useful to investors because  by removing the effect of intangible asset costs and m a activity the level of which may vary from company to company  it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry 
we also present a tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio which  in addition to the items described above  excludes the preferred stock 
these measures are utilized by management to assess our financial performance and capital adequacy 
we provide reconcilements in tables and in the md a for all non us gaap measures

within our geographic footprint  we operate under four business segments retail and commercial  wholesale banking  wealth and investment management  and mortgage

executive summary during  macro economic conditions negatively impacted liquidity and credit quality across the financial markets  especially in the consumer sector  as the us economy experienced a recession 
the national bureau of economic research published a report in december indicating that the us has been in a recession since december as indicated most prominently  in their view  by the declining labor market since that time 
since december  in addition to deterioration in the labor market  the recession has caused rising unemployment  volatile equity markets  and declining home values  all of which are weighing negatively on consumer sentiment as evidenced by weak spending throughout the year  especially during the fourth quarter 
during the year  financial markets experienced unprecedented events  and the market exhibited extreme volatility and evaporating liquidity as credit quality concerns  sharp fluctuations in commodity prices  volatility in rate indices such as prime and libor  and illiquidity persisted 
concerns regarding increased credit losses from the weakening economy negatively affected the capital and earnings levels of most financial institutions 
in addition  certain financial institutions failed or merged with stronger institutions and two government sponsored enterprises entered into conservatorship with the us government 
liquidity in the debt markets was extremely low despite the treasury and federal reserve efforts to inject capital and liquidity into financial institutions  and as a result  asset values continued to be under pressure 

table of contents in october  the united states government established the eesa in response to instability in the financial markets 
the specific implications of the eesa include the authorization given to the secretary of the treasury to establish the troubled asset relief program to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions 
the definition of troubled assets is broad but includes residential and commercial mortgages  as well as mortgage related securities originated on or before march   if the secretary determines the purchase promotes financial market stability 
to date  the treasury has not purchased troubled assets under its authority to do so under the eesa 
alternatively  the treasury has focused on providing assistance through the associated capital purchase program cpp and targeted investment program by purchasing preferred equity interests in the country s largest financial institutions 
in an attempt to revitalize the struggling economy and inject necessary liquidity and capital into the banking system  the government purchased billion dollars in preferred stock in certain institutions during during the fourth quarter of  we sold billion in preferred stock and related warrants  the maximum amount allowed under the cpp  to the treasury 
our decision to participate was made to enhance our already solid capital position and to allow us to further expand our business 
we believe that our decision to sell the maximum shares was prudent in order to bolster capital as a result of increasingly adverse economic results 
upon receipt of the funds  we developed strategies and tactics to deploy the capital in a fashion that balances supporting economic stability  safety and soundness  and earnings 
specifically  the additional capital has been deployed thus far by increasing our agency mbs and loans  as well as by decreasing short term borrowings 
we recognize our responsibility to use proceeds from the cpp in a manner that is consistent with the public interest and are committed to providing timely public disclosure of our deployment of the cpp proceeds 
see additional discussion in the capital resources and liquidity risk sections of this md a 
the degree of government intervention through the purchase of direct investments in private and public companies is unprecedented 
as a result  the complete effect and impact from these actions is uncertain 
in addition  several federal  state  and local legislative proposals are pending that may affect our business 
it is unclear whether these will be enacted  and if so  the impact they will have on our industry 
we remain active and vigilant in monitoring these developments and supporting the interests of our shareholders  while also supporting the broader economy 
in addition  during october  the fdic announced the tlgp  under which it would temporarily guarantee certain new debt issued by insured banks and qualifying bank holding companies and temporarily expand its insurance to cover all noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
it was also announced that the federal reserve would serve as a buyer of commercial paper 
these actions  among others  were anticipated to stimulate consumer confidence in the economy and financial institutions  as well as encourage financial institutions to continue lending to businesses  consumers  and each other 
we have issued billion in debt under the tlgp  which provides us with a lower cost of funding due to narrower credit spreads realized in association with the fdic guarantee 
see additional discussion in the other short term borrowings and long term debt section of this md a 
in december  the federal reserve fed took unprecedented action in lowering the federal funds rate by basis points to a targeted range of zero to one quarter percent 
the board of governors also lowered the discount rate basis points to one half percent 
this action was the seventh rate cut of the year causing the prime rate to decline basis points since january  to at year end 
further  the fed increased its term auction facility taf program offerings during the year by billion  which are similar borrowing instruments to term federal funds 
in addition  due to the continuing strain on the financial markets  the fed has offered numerous temporary liquidity facilities in an effort to stabilize credit markets and improve the access to credit of businesses and households 
see the liquidity risk section in this md a for additional discussion of the fed s actions 
while our most immediate priority is to maintain the fundamental financial strength of the organization  we continue to run a successful organization serving clients  making sound credit decisions  generating deposits  and operating as efficiently as possible 
to this end  during the year we grew average loans and consumer and commercial deposits and  respectively  and improved our loan and deposit mix while maintaining our net interest income at levels comparable to the prior year 
we also experienced growth in certain fee income associated with our core businesses 
further  we tightly managed growth of core operating expenses  which reflected the continuing success of our ongoing program to improve efficiency and productivity  although expenses continue to be pressured by increased credit related costs 
we solidified our capital position during the year through the preferred stock issuance discussed above and also completed three separate transactions to optimize our long term holdings of coke common stock 
see investment in common shares of the coca cola company in this md a for additional discussion 
we are pursuing initiatives that will expand our revenue generation capacity  improve efficiency  increase profitability on a risk adjusted basis  and prudently manage credit 
to that end  the most important factors upon which management has and will continue to focus include prudent lending practices  credit loss mitigation  expense management  growing customer relationships  and increasing brand awareness 
successfully managing through the current credit cycle is of critical importance 
given the significant downturn in the economy during  we expect this credit cycle to be protracted 
credit quality deteriorated significantly in due to the 
table of contents decline in the residential real estate markets and broader recessionary economic conditions 
as such  we took steps to assure continued prudent lending practices were followed by extending credit to clients that met our underwriting standards as well as instituted certain loss mitigation steps 
furthering our already strong lending practices  in  we evaluated our underwriting standards based on the current economic conditions  discontinued originating home equity lines through third party channels that tend to be riskier with higher loan to values at origination  and implemented revised loan to value guidelines in certain declining markets 
as a result of the tumultuous economy during  we took action to assist in mitigating potential losses that included reducing or closing high risk accounts  improving our on going portfolio monitoring  and completing extensive loan workout programs 
our workout programs are designed to help clients stay in their homes by re working residential mortgages and home equity loans to achieve payment structures that they could afford 
through this workout program we have helped over  clients who were at risk of foreclosure to stay in their homes 
see additional discussion of our prudent lending initiatives and loss mitigation steps in the loans  allowance for loans and lease losses  provision for loan losses  and nonperforming assets sections of this md a 
as the economy worsened and credit related losses increased in  our continued vigilance over expenses became an important focus 
our excellence in execution efficiency and productivity program e program began in  well before the recession  to lower our cost structure and drive higher financial performance 
this successful program allowed us to reduce expense run rates by million in and is expected to provide total savings of million in in addition  we have taken additional extraordinary steps to manage expenses including the elimination of annual merit based salary increases in for our senior management team  comprised of over  individuals  as well as paying no bonuses to selected members of the executive management team 
we have also lowered the expected average wage increase for those receiving a merit increase by one third  reduced the amount available for promotion increases  eliminated our annual sales conference and sales award trips for our top producers  and have placed further restriction on travel and meal related expenses 
the prevailing economic conditions and the resulting destabilization of many other financial institutions present an opportunity for us to establish new customer relationships and expand existing ones by increasing our brand awareness 
as a result of these difficult economic times  we found that consumers are looking for a stable banking partner that mirrors their values of being cautious and prudent with their finances  which is the source of our new branding live solid 
bank solid 
our focus is on providing that stability to our current and future clients with core business products 
our objectives include increasing core business revenues while obtaining lower funding costs through growth in customer deposits 
the live solid 
bank solid 
brand compliments the my cause deposit campaign  which ended in october during  my cause generated total household deposit growth of approximately  with checking account households growing approximately 
deposit growth continued during the fourth quarter of  where we grew our average consumer and commercial deposits by over the third quarter of in  we will continue our focus on growing customer deposits 
we reported net income available to common shareholders at december  of million  or per average common diluted share  compared to billion  or per average common diluted share  at december  fully taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  net interest margin in decreased only one basis point when compared to the prior year

the provision for loan losses was million higher than net charge offs of billion for the year 
the allowance for loan and lease losses increased billion  or  from december  and was of total loans not carried at fair value compared to as of december  net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended compared to for nonperforming assets rose significantly during the year to billion at year end compared to billion at the end of last year 
the tier capital and total capital ratios improved from and  respectively  at december  to and at december  the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio improved from at december  to at december   while the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio declined to from during this same time

the decrease in net interest income was due in part to a decline in market interest rates  the increase in nonperforming assets  a reduction in coke and federal home loan bank fhlb dividend income  and libor rate volatility 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 the net interest payments on billion of receive fixed swaps are reflected in trading income versus net interest income 
prior to adoption  this reclassification would have contributed approximately basis points to net interest margin based on the decline in libor 
the net interest margin increased from for the third quarter of to for the fourth quarter of the effects of lower floating rate loan yields and an increase in nonaccrual loans were more than offset by an aggressive reduction in deposit pricing  lower wholesale funding costs  and the issuance of billion of preferred securities to the treasury

table of contents real estate home equity lines 
the increase in commercial loan balances was driven by increased utilization of lines of credit by our larger corporate clients due to dislocation in commercial paper and bond markets during the increases in commercial  commercial real estate  and real estate home equity lines were partially offset by the decline in real estate construction loans of billion  or  due to our efforts to reduce our exposure to construction loans and transfers to nonaccrual status 
average loans held for sale were billion  a decrease of billion  or  as mortgage loan originations declined 
production shifted to predominantly agency products and efficiency improved in loan delivery 
average investment securities available for sale increased billion  or  while average interest earning trading assets declined by billion  or 
despite the decline in trading assets  we have continued to actively use this portfolio as part of our overall asset liability management 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased billion  or  year over year 
this included increases of billion  or  in money market accounts and billion  or  in now accounts 
these were partially offset by decreases of billion  or  in savings and billion  or  in demand deposits 
the change in deposit mix represents a migration among clients from lower yielding accounts to higher yielding accounts in response to the decline in market rates 
the growth in money market accounts was influenced by sales strategies in which money market products were used as a lead product to help retain a greater portion of maturing time deposits and other account balances 
the overall growth in consumer and commercial deposits  coupled with the billion  or  increase in lower cost long term debt  enabled a reduction in higher cost funding sources of billion  or 
the decline in funding sources is primarily related to a billion decrease in brokered deposits and a billion decrease in average foreign deposits 
we continue to pursue deposit growth initiatives utilizing product promotions to increase our presence in specific markets within our footprint 
overall  competition for deposits remains strong as our competitors attempt to satisfy funding needs in light of the liquidity issues prevailing in the market 
as a result  we are facing significant deposit pricing pressure across our footprint 
despite these challenging market conditions  we have used a combination of regional and product specific pricing initiatives to reduce our rates more aggressively than our peer banks  while still growing our average deposit balances 
the market environment began with a flat yield curve and steepened throughout the year 
the fed funds target rate averaged for  a decrease of basis points compared to one month libor decreased basis points to  three month libor decreased basis points to  five year swaps decreased basis points to and ten year swaps decreased basis points to compared to prior year 
deposit rates  our most significant funding source  tend to track movements in one month libor  while our fixed loan yields tend to track movements in the five year swap rate 
foregone interest income from nonperforming loans had a negative impact of basis points on net interest margin in compared to four basis points of negative impact in  as average nonaccrual loans increased billion  or  over table contains more detailed information concerning average loans  yields and rates paid 
predicting the movement in net interest margin during would be difficult given the continued volatility in interest rates  the relatively low level of interest rates  and competitive dynamics for raising deposits 
however  we believe the risks to the net interest margin in of deposit pricing  rate compression  nonperforming asset levels  and asset mix will outweigh the primary opportunity associated with deposit volume and mix

table of contents noninterest income noninterest income increased by billion  or  in  compared to  driven largely by an increase in net securities gains  including a non taxable gain on the contribution of a portion of our investment in coke common stock  and mark to market gains on our public debt and related hedges along with gains from the sale of certain non strategic businesses 
these gains were partially offset by impairment of our msrs portfolio  mark to market losses on illiquid trading securities and loan warehouses  losses related to our decision to purchase certain auction rate securities ars from our clients  and other than temporary impairment charges on securities recorded during the year 
in the short run  we do not foresee any catalysts that will materially improve the core level of fee income generation  with the exception of mortgage production related income  which may increase significantly along with loan volume in the first quarter of if the sharp reduction in interest rates on conforming mortgages continues during the quarter 
transaction fee related income  which includes service charges on deposit accounts  card fees  and other charges and fees  increased million  or  compared to  driven by an increase in both consumer and business deposit account activity  primarily due to growth in the number of accounts  higher non sufficient fund rates  and an increase in the occurrence of non sufficient fund fees 
trust and investment management income decreased million  or  compared to  driven by lower market valuations on managed assets due to the decline in the equity markets  as well as a decline in revenue as a result of the sales of our remaining interest in lighthouse investment partners on january  and first mercantile on may  trading account profits losses and commissions increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to million in mark to market gains on our public debt and related hedges during compared with gains of million in these gains were related to the widening of credit spreads across the entire financial market as a result of the global credit crisis 
when stability in the debt market returns  spreads are expected to tighten  and if this occurs then these valuation gains will reverse 
the increase in trading income during was also due to strong performance in fixed income sales and trading  direct finance  and foreign exchange within our broker dealer subsidiary offset by weaker performance in fixed income derivatives  structured leasing  and equity offerings due to volatile market conditions 
the gains recorded during were partially offset by million in mark to market losses on illiquid trading securities acquired during the fourth quarter of as a result of the continuing declines in home values and increasing consumer real estate delinquency levels  which affected liquidity and technical pricing in the broader market during the year related to abs 
also offsetting these gains were million in losses related to our decision to purchase certain ars from our clients  along with associated fines  and a million loss on a million par value lehman brothers holdings  inc lehman brothers bond we purchased from an affiliated money market mutual fund 
as of december   the fair value of this bond was million 
see additional discussion of this security that was purchased in the trading assets and liabilities section of this md a 
the fair value of the illiquid securities acquired in the fourth quarter of declined to approximately million as of december   down from an acquisition cost of approximately billion  primarily due to sales 
during  we recorded million in negative mark to market valuations on collateralized debt obligations  mbs  siv securities  and collateralized loan obligations  which were partially offset by million in gains related to the adoption of fair value for certain trading assets and liabilities and related hedges 
during  the million loss in trading account profits and commissions related to ars was recognized because we determined that we had a probable loss pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
that could be reasonably estimated as the difference between the par amount and the estimated fair value of ars that we believe we will likely purchase from investors 
as of december   we have completed the repurchase of roughly one third of the approximately million face value of the securities 
approximately million of these securities are either government sponsored or where the issuer has indicated support of the underlying assets 
the remaining million of securities pertains to a senior tranche within a securitization of trust preferred securities 
our cash flow projections under even a stressed scenario indicate full collection of principal and interest on these securities 
the volume of repurchase activity increased in early  and through mid february  we have completed approximately three fourths of the expected repurchases 
combined mortgage related income decreased million  or  compared to mortgage servicing related income decreased million  or  compared to  primarily due to million in impairment charges on our msrs portfolio  all carried at amortized cost  that was caused by an increase in expected loan prepayments due to declining interest rates during the fourth quarter of the decrease in was also driven by higher amortization of msrs driven by growth in the servicing portfolio from billion as of december  to billion as of december   and lower gains on the sale of mortgage servicing assets when compared to these declines were offset by higher servicing fee income driven by the aforementioned growth in the servicing portfolio 
mortgage production related income increased million  or  compared to  despite a decline in loan production volume to billion in  due to lower valuation losses resulting from spread widening on loans held for 
table of contents sale  in part due to the elimination of alt a loans from the warehouse 
the increase was also a result of lower valuation losses on illiquid and delinquent warehouse loans and the earlier recognition of servicing value and origination fees resulting from our election to record certain mortgage loans at fair value beginning in may the prior period also included million of income reductions recorded in conjunction with our election to record certain loans held for sale at fair value 
these increases in income when compared with were offset by an increase in our reserve for write downs on mortgage loans that we anticipate we will have to repurchase from prior sales 
this reserve is established at the time of the sale based on expectations for the volume of repurchases and the severity of losses upon ultimate disposition 
in the current environment  higher customer default rates  heightened scrutiny of loan documentation by investors  and larger write downs upon repurchase are all impacting the level of required reserves 
in addition to this offset to mortgage production related income  we also incurred negative valuation adjustments on our portfolio loans and loans held for sale carried at fair value and lower fee income associated with lower production volume 
while loan production is down  the percentage of agency eligible secondary market production increased to approximately of secondary market production compared to approximately in agency eligible loans  also known as conforming loans  are defined as mortgage loans eligible for secondary market purchase by gnma  fnma  or fhlmc 
to be considered eligible  loans must adhere to maximum loan amount guidelines  debt to income ratio limits  and stricter documentation requirements

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate construction loans 
we believe that our portfolio is well diversified by product  client  and geography throughout our footprint  and has relatively low exposure to unsecured consumer loan products 
a portion of the increase  approximately billion as of december   came as a result of the loans acquired in the gb t purchase during the second quarter of commercial loans were billion  an increase of billion  or  from december   and comprise of the total loan portfolio at december  the commercial loan portfolio is well diversified by industry  collateral  and geography 
the primary reason for the increase was the disruption in the short term corporate funding markets during the second half of  resulting in certain commercial and large corporate clients accessing bank lines for funding 
as such  beginning in the third quarter of in particular  we experienced an increase in the utilization levels of our outstanding commercial loan facilities

approximately of our home equity lines are in a first lien position 
we continue to enhance our collections and default management processes and where possible  reduce outstanding line commitments  however  we expect the home equity line portfolio to continue to show elevated nonaccrual and charge off levels in the near future 
the construction portfolio was billion  or of total loans  at december   down billion  or  from december  the construction portfolio consists of residential construction to perm loans billion  residential construction loans billion  commercial construction loans billion  acquisition and development loans billion  and raw land loans billion 
approximately one third of this portfolio is owner occupied  which provides additional sources of repayment and helps mitigate risk of loss 
we have reduced the level of risk in the construction portfolio by prudently managing our construction exposure 
this is evident by the declines in outstanding balances since december in the construction to perm down  residential construction down  commercial construction down  and acquisition and development down portfolios 
further  these net decreases include the addition of construction loans from the gb t acquisition that occurred in the second quarter commercial related construction loans represent of the total construction portfolio and continue to perform well 
overall performance of residential construction related loans has deteriorated since the fourth quarter of consistent with the general decline in the economy 
we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning for problem loans in the portfolio 
for example  we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrower capacity and their ability to service obligations in a steep market decline 
we have strict limits and have exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification 
in some cases  the maturity date of certain residential real estate related loans  namely construction to perm and lot loans  has been extended as a result of market delays in completing the build out phase of the home 
these borrowers continue to perform  consequently  the loans remain on accruing status 
it is possible that these borrowers could experience varying degrees of financial difficulties  resulting potentially in more significant loan modifications 
the commercial real estate portfolio was billion  or of total loans  an increase of billion  or  from december  of this increase  million was due to the acquisition of gb t 
this portfolio includes both owner occupied and income producing collateral  with approximately being owner occupied properties 
the primary source of loan repayment for owner occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations  which diversifies the risk or sources of repayment 
although we have not seen a significant deterioration on the fundamentals in our income property or owner occupied products  recent market conditions have presented some rising vacancies among retail  office  and industrial products 

table of contents the indirect consumer portfolio was billion  or of total loans  at december   down million  or  from december  this portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans generated through dealerships and has a current weighted average fico of the decrease is largely attributable to the recent slowdown in automobile sales and our specific decision to reduce exposure in this portfolio 
this portfolio is experiencing a higher level of net charge offs compared to the fourth quarter of  driven by declining auto auction prices  especially for suvs and large pick up trucks 
the direct consumer portfolio was billion  or of total loans  at december   up billion  or from december   almost entirely due to growth in student loans 
student loans  which are mostly government supported  made up billion  or  of the direct consumer portfolio 
this portfolio also consists of loans and lines to individuals for personal or family uses 
the decrease in loans held for sale from december  to december  of billion was due primarily to a decline in total loan production of billion  or from to during and  we transferred million and million  respectively  in loans from held for sale to held for investment 
the transfer included loans that we determined could not be sold due to underwriting defects or payment defaults  as well as non agency residential loans for which deteriorating market conditions impacted our ability to sell these loans

previously  period end loans included loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market 
the company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the allowance for loan losses relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost 
loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market that have been excluded from the prior period calculation were million  which did not change the calculation by more than one basis point as of december  amounts excluded in years prior to were immaterial and resulted in no basis point change in the respective calculation

the company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the allowance for loan losses relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost

allowance for loan and lease losses we continuously monitor the quality of our loan portfolio and maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses alll sufficient to absorb probable estimable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we are committed to the timely recognition of problem loans and maintaining an appropriate and adequate alll 
in addition to the review of credit quality through ongoing credit review processes  we employ a variety of modeling and estimation techniques to measure credit risk and construct an appropriate alll 
numerous asset quality measures  both quantitative and qualitative  are considered in estimating the alll 
our alll committee has the responsibility of affirming the allowance methodology and assessing significant risk elements in order to determine the appropriate level of allowance for the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at the point in time being reviewed 
the multiple factors evaluated include net charge off trends  collateral values and geographic location  borrower fico scores  delinquency rates  nonperforming and restructured loans  origination channel  product mix  underwriting practices  and economic trends 
these credit quality factors are incorporated into various loss estimation models and tools utilized in our alll process or are qualitatively considered in evaluating the overall reasonableness of the alll 
the factors that have the greatest quantitative impact on the estimated alll tend to be recent net charge off trends  delinquency rates  and loss severity levels ie  collateral values  as these factors tend to be contemporaneous in nature  as well as have a pervasive impact on the applicable loan pools  while factors such as 
table of contents nonperforming or restructured loans tend to have a more isolated impact on subsets of loans in the loan pools 
also impacting the alll is the estimated incurred loss period  which tends to be approximately one year for consumer related loans and between one and one half to three years for wholesale related loans 
the alll process excludes loans measured at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 as subsequent mark to market adjustments related to loans measured at fair value include a credit risk component 
at december   the alll was  million  which represented of period end loans not carried at fair value 
this compares with an alll of  million  or of period end loans not carried at fair value  as of december  the increase in alll reflects decreasing home prices and the associated increasing level of delinquencies  nonperforming loans  and net charge offs in the residential real estate related portions of the loan portfolio 
also affecting the increase in the alll was million added in conjunction with the gb t acquisition 
our alll framework has two basic elements specific allowances for loans individually evaluated for impairment and a component for pools of homogeneous loans not individually evaluated 
beginning in  the portion of the unallocated allowance for inherent imprecision and incomplete data is reflected within the component for pools of homogenous loans 
the first element of the alll analysis involves the estimation of allowances specific to individual impaired loans 
in this process  specific allowances are established for larger commercial impaired loans based on an analysis of the most probable sources of repayment  including discounted cash flows  liquidation of collateral  or the market value of the loan itself 
as of december  and  the specific allowance related to impaired loans that were individually evaluated totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in alll associated with impaired loans individually evaluated is primarily driven by deterioration in loans to residential builders and several large credits within the wholesale line of business 
the second element of the alll  the general allowance for homogeneous loan pools not individually evaluated  is determined by applying allowance factors to pools of loans within the portfolio that have similar risk characteristics 
the general allowance factors are determined using a baseline factor that is developed from an analysis of historical net charge off experience and expected losses 
expected losses are based on estimated probabilities of default and loss given default derived from our internal risk rating process 
these baseline factors are developed and applied to the various loan pools 
adjustments may be made to baseline reserves for some of the loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
these influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting  concentration risk  and or recent observable asset quality trends 
we continually evaluate our alll methodology seeking to refine and enhance this process as appropriate  and it is likely that the methodology will continue to evolve over time 
as of december  and  the general allowance calculations totaled  million and  million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to declining home prices and the associated deterioration in credit quality of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios 
our charge off policy meets or exceeds regulatory minimums 
losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at days past due compared to the regulatory loss criteria of days 
secured consumer loans  including residential real estate  are typically charged off between and days  depending on the collateral type  in compliance with federal financial institution examination council guidelines 
commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest is past due for days or more unless the loan is both secured by collateral having realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in full and the loan is in the legal process of collection 
accordingly  secured loans may be charged down to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed 
subsequent charge offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects 
the alll recorded for real estate loans was  million  or of total real estate loans 
the increase in alll is primarily associated with the residential mortgage  home equity  and residential construction portfolios and is primarily resulting from decreasing home prices and borrower credit deterioration 
the alll recorded for commercial loans was million  or of the commercial loans  an increase of million in the increase is primarily due to loan growth and credit deterioration of several large credits in the wholesale line of business 
the ratio of the alll to total nonperforming loans decreased to as of december  from as of december  the decline in this ratio was due to a  million increase in nonperforming loans driven primarily by increases in residential mortgage and real estate construction nonperforming loans  partially offset by the increase in the alll 
the increase in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by deteriorating economic conditions including increased mortgage delinquency rates and declining home values in most markets that we serve 
the product type of nonperforming loans is a key determinant in evaluating the relationship between alll and nonperforming loans 
we charge off residential nonperforming loans to the expected net realizable value of the loans sixty days after they are classified as nonperforming 
the charge off is applied against the alll  therefore  the relationship between alll and nonperforming loans becomes unlinked since the carrying value of many of the nonperforming loans has already recognized losses that are estimated to be 
table of contents realized 
another factor that mitigates the increase in the alll is that most loans have some amount of realizable value  therefore  while the entire loan is classified as nonperforming  only the amount of estimated losses would have been captured in the alll 
the reserve for unfunded commitments was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
lending commitments such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments are assessed similarly to unfunded wholesale loans except utilization assumptions are considered 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes to the reserves recorded in other expense 
net charge offs for the year ended december  increased  million from the million of net charge offs recorded in the prior year 
the increase in net charge offs was largely due to higher net charge offs in the residential mortgage  construction  and home equity portfolios 
a downturn in residential real estate prices has negatively affected the entire industry 
despite our avoidance of the subprime consumer real estate lending markets in our loan portfolio  the lower residential real estate valuations and recessionary economic conditions have affected borrowers of higher credit quality as well 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis estimating an appropriate and adequate alll 
the analysis includes the evaluation of impaired loans as prescribed under sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  and pooled loans and leases as prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  million  an increase of  million  or  from the year ended december  early stage delinquencies accruing loans past due days were billion  or of total loans at december   an increase of basis points from december  contributing to the increase in the provision for loan losses were sharp declines in home values during with some of our florida markets declining while many other markets declined or less 
fourth quarter provision for loan losses increased million from the third quarter primarily due to significant deterioration in the economy and resulting deterioration in credit quality and higher fourth quarter of net charge offs 
fourth quarter credit quality deterioration was particularly evident in early stage delinquencies which were stable most of around of total loans but increased to by year end due to an intensification of recessionary conditions 
the increase in early stage delinquencies was primarily in the residential mortgage related portfolios 
the provision for loan losses was million more than net charge offs of  million during  reflecting the downturn in the residential real estate markets and the resulting deterioration in credit conditions of the residential mortgage  construction  and home equity portfolios 
net charge offs for were  million higher than net charge offs recorded in net charge offs to average loans were in compared to in the increase was largely due to higher net charge offs in the residential mortgage  home equity  and construction portfolios 
a downturn in residential real estate prices has negatively affected the entire industry  including higher credit quality products and borrowers 
we anticipate declines in home values and rising unemployment will result in additional net charge offs in future periods

these loans are not considered to be nonperforming because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms 
this change better aligns our definition of nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets with the one used by peer institutions and therefore improves comparability of this measure across the industry

residential mortgages and home equity lines represent of nonaccruals  and if residential related construction loans are included  then nonaccruals related to residential real estate represent of total nonperforming loans 
the second quarter gb t acquisition accounted for million of the increase in nonperforming assets 
the increases in nonperforming assets is largely related to the housing correction and related decline in the values of residential real estate 
as loans work through their migration process  we anticipate nonaccrual loans to continue increasing until we experience sustained improvement in the delinquency level of our loan portfolios 
the nonperforming assets balance is also affected by the time it takes to complete the foreclosure process  especially in judicial jurisdictions 
nonperforming residential real estate loans are collateralized by one to four family properties and a portion of the risk is mitigated by mortgage insurance 
we apply rigorous loss mitigation processes to these nonperforming loans to ensure that the asset value is preserved to the greatest extent possible 
since early  we have tightened the underwriting standards applicable to many of the residential loan products offered 
we do not originate subprime loans or option arms for our balance sheet 
the total alt a portfolio loans  which consist of loans with lower documentation standards  were approximately billion as of december   down from december  the alt a loans are of the total loans and of our residential mortgage portfolio

we have now eliminated alt a production entirely 
at the end of  the prime second portfolio totaled billion with billion insured 
during the second quarter of  the insurance provider stopped providing mortgage insurance on newly originated prime second mortgages  however  existing policies remain in force 
these policies provide insurance on a pool basis and generally cover of the loss up to a maximum loss percentage eg  stop loss for the entire pool 
more specifically  the policies generally cover losses up to 
table of contents of the original pool balance  we cover the next of losses and then the insurer covers the next of losses to the final stop loss level of 
frequently  these loss limits are segregated by book years where each book year has its own stop loss 
due to deterioration in the delinquency rates  the loss estimates for the prime second portfolio increased during the fourth quarter of thus  we expect to breach the first stop loss level on our prime seconds and experience credit losses on these loans in accordingly  the alll as of december  reflects our uninsured portion of the estimated losses 
loans in these pool policies must be originated under parameters agreed to under the insurance policy 
if a loan is either originated outside of agreed upon parameters  or found to contain a material misrepresentation on the loan application or appraisal  then the loan may not be insurable 
upon receipt of a claim  the mortgage insurer reviews the applicable loan file for proper documentation to verify that the loan met the documentation and underwriting terms of the mortgage insurance agreement 
if the mortgage insurer denies the claim  we will review and verify the reason for the denied claim and independently determine if the claim denial was appropriate 
if we disagree with the mortgage insurer s decision to deny the claim  we will discuss the circumstances with the mortgage insurer in attempt to reach a common understanding and acceptable resolution 
when a denied claim is under review  we will reserve for the loss contingency based on the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as of december   we had reserved approximately million related to potential claim denials  which were recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
total claims paid during and under the mortgage insurance arrangement were million and million  respectively

we are proactively managing troubled and potentially troubled mortgage and home equity loans as part of our extensive workout programs to help clients stay in their homes by reworking these loans to achieve an affordable payment structure 
these modifications may include interest rate or repayment terms adjustments 
accruing loans with modifications that are deemed to be economic concessions are reported as restructured 
nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to restructured 
accruing restructured loans were million at december   an increase of million from december  other real estate owned oreo as of december  was million  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase was primarily due to the level of residential mortgage and residential construction loans acquired through foreclosure 
as of year end  million of oreo was comprised of single family residential properties 
upon foreclosure  these properties were written down to their estimated net realizable value  less selling costs 
we are aggressively working these foreclosed assets to minimize losses  however  further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties 
the amount of net inflows into oreo has increased over the past several quarters as nonperforming loans are worked through the foreclosure process 
most of our oreo properties are located in georgia  california and florida 
interest income on nonaccrual loans  if recognized  is recorded using the cash basis method of accounting 
for the years ended and  this amounted to million and million  respectively 
for the years ended and  estimated interest income of million and million  respectively  would have been recorded if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contract terms 
as of december   accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by million from december  to  million  primarily in residential mortgage related and commercial real estate portfolios 
the increase was primarily driven by loans sold to government national mortgage association that were ninety days or more past due  which increased million from december  when information about borrowers possible credit problems causes us to have serious doubts about their ability to repay under the contractual terms of the loan  we classify those loans as nonaccrual

based on our evaluation of these standards and our balance sheet management strategies and objectives  we early adopted these fair value standards as of january  in conjunction with adopting sfas no 
 we elected to initially record specific financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
these instruments included all  or a portion  of the following debt  available for sale debt securities  adjustable rate residential mortgage portfolio loans  securitization warehouses  and trading loans 
as a result of recording these financial assets and liabilities at fair value as of january   in accordance with sfas no

as of december   the amount of trading securities outstanding for this purpose was approximately million of fixed rate corporate bonds in financial services companies 
derivative assets and liabilities increased during by billion and billion  respectively 
this increase was driven by the movements in fair values of interest rate based derivatives as both current and projected future interest rates declined significantly during the fourth quarter of the higher increase in derivative assets relative to derivative liabilities during the year is due to gains in fair value from derivative positions that we use as risk management tools

during  we recognized approximately million in net market valuation losses related to these abs 
through sales  maturities and write downs  we reduced our exposure to these distressed assets by approximately billion since the acquisition of these in the fourth quarter of  making the exposure at december  approximately million 
during the year  we sold over billion in securities and received over million in payments related to securities acquired during the fourth quarter of we continue to actively evaluate our holdings of these securities with the objective of opportunistically lowering our exposure to them 
in addition  we expect paydowns to continue on many of the residential mbs  however  more than half of the remaining acquired portfolio consists of sivs undergoing enforcement proceedings  and therefore any significant reduction in the portfolio will largely depend on the status of those proceedings 
while further losses are possible  our experience during the year reinforces our belief that we have appropriately written these assets down to fair value as of december  the estimated market value of these securities is based on market information  where available  along with significant  unobservable third party data 
as a result of the high degree of judgment and estimates used to value these illiquid securities  the market values could vary significantly in future periods

in september  we purchased  at amortized cost plus accrued interest  a lehman brothers security from the ridgeworth prime quality money market fund the fund 
the fund received a cash payment for the accrued interest along with a million note that we issued 
ridgeworth  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  is the investment adviser to the fund 
the lehman brothers security went into default when lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september we took this action in response to the unprecedented market events during the third quarter and to protect investors in the fund from losses associated with this specific security 
when purchased by the fund  the lehman brothers security was rated a p and was a tier eligible security 
lehman brothers is currently in liquidation and the ultimate timing and form of repayment on the security is not known at this time 
during  we recorded a pre tax market valuation loss of million as a result of the purchase 
we evaluated this transaction under the applicable accounting guidance and concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidation of the fund was not appropriate

table of contents certain asset backed commercial paper abcp from certain money market mutual funds the mmmf 
these purchases will be made by the participating institution at a price equal to the mmmf s amortized cost 
the fed will then make a fixed rate non recourse loan to the participating institution that will mature on the same date as the abcp that was purchased with a specific draw 
as of december   suntrust robinson humphrey strh owned million of eligible abcp at a fair value of million

subsequent to december   all of this abcp matured  strh collected of the par amount of this abcp from the issuer and repaid the loan to the fed 
at december   this abcp was classified within trading assets and carried at fair value  and the loans from the fed were elected to be carried at fair value pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and classified within other short term borrowings 
because of the non recourse nature of the loan  we did not recognize through earnings any differences in fair value between the loans and the abcp

table of contents securities available for sale the securities available for sale portfolio is managed as part of the overall asset and liability management process to optimize income and market performance over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating risk 
for much of the securities portfolio remained relatively constant with cash flow from maturities and prepayments primarily reinvested into longer duration agency mbs 
the size of the portfolio was billion as of december   an increase of billion  or  from december   due primarily to the net purchases during the fourth quarter of of mbs issued by federal agencies  offset by the sale and contribution of a portion of our investment in coke common stock along with a decline in the fair value of the remaining portion of the coke common stock 
net securities gains of billion were realized during  primarily due to the sale and contribution of a portion of our investment in coke common stock from which a million gain was realized 
additionally in the fourth quarter of  billion of mbs issued by federal agencies were purchased and billion of primarily agency mbs were sold generating a million realized gain 
the securites sold were held in conjunction with our risk management strategies associated with economically hedging the value of msrs 
net securities gains realized for the year ended december  were million primarily related to the sale of coke common stock  while we realized net securities losses of million for the year ended december  the portfolio s effective duration decreased to as of december  from as of december  the decline was caused by an increase in prepayment assumptions on our mbs portfolio 
effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates  taking into consideration embedded options 
an effective duration of suggests an expected price change of from a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates 
the average yield for declined to compared to during the yield remained relatively constant during the first half of but began to decline significantly from during the second quarter to during the third quarter  and during the fourth quarter 
the decline in yield during the second half of was primarily driven by a decline in dividend income as a result of the sale and contribution of a portion of our investment in coke common stock 
the yield during the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by the decision of the fhlb to delay the declaration of their quarterly dividend until the first quarter of we expect to see a further decline in the yield on available for sale securities in the first quarter of due to the timing of the net purchase of lower yielding mbs issued by federal agencies in late december 
in addition  should we experience an increase in prepayments on these newly acquired mbs during the first quarter of  we would see an additional decrease in yield due to the immediate recognition of the unamortized premium on these securities 
the carrying value of available for sale securities reflected billion in net unrealized gains as of december   comprised of a billion unrealized gain from our remaining million shares of coke common stock and a less than billion net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio 
the credit quality of the securities portfolio was bolstered as a result of our purchase of agency mbs  with approximately of the total securities available for sale portfolio rated aaa  the highest possible rating by nationally recognized rating agencies 
we review all of our securities with unrealized losses for other than temporary impairment at least quarterly 
during  we recorded million in other than temporary impairment charges within securities gains losses  primarily related to million in residential mbs and residual interests in which the default rates and loss severities of the underlying collateral  including subprime and alt a loans  increased significantly during the year 
these securities were valued using either third party pricing data  including broker indicative bids  or expected cash flow models 
there were no similar charges recorded in there is a potential in the future that proposed bankruptcy legislation may lead to future other than temporary impairment charges associated primarily with super senior private mbs  the amount of which is uncertain 
the amortized cost of these securities was million with associated net unrealized losses of approximately million as of december  we hold stock in the fhlb of atlanta and fhlb of cincinnati totaling million as of december  we account for the stock based on the industry guidance in statement of position sop accounting by certain entities including entities with trade receivables that lend to or finance the activities of others  which requires the investment be carried at cost and be evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value 
we evaluated our holdings in fhlb stock at december  and believe our holdings in the stock are ultimately recoverable at par 
in addition  we do not have operational or liquidity needs that would require a redemption of the stock in the foreseeable future and therefore determined that the stock was not other than temporarily impaired 

table of contents difficult to value financial assets and liabilities the broad credit crisis that was triggered by the subprime loan melt down intensified throughout and  as the broader economy continued to worsen  the credit and liquidity markets became dysfunctional 
the second half of was marked by turmoil in the financial sector  with the failure or government induced acquisitions of several large banks and investment banks  increased unemployment  and further declines in real estate values 
additional liquidity adjustments were made on many securities  and wider spreads caused valuing our level financial instruments to become even more difficult 
fair value is the estimated price using market based inputs or assumptions that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
current market conditions have led to diminished  and in some cases  non existent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we own 
we are required to consider observable inputs  to the extent available  in the fair value estimation process  unless that data results from forced liquidations or distressed sales 
when available  we will obtain third party broker quotes or observable market pricing data  as this level of evidence is the strongest support for the fair value of these instruments  absent current market activity in that specific security or a similar security 
despite our best efforts to maximize the use of relevant observable inputs  the current market environment has diminished the observability of trades and assumptions that have historically been available 
as such  the degree to which significant unobservable inputs have been utilized in our valuation procedures has increased  largely with respect to certain types of loans  securities  and public debt 
this decrease in observability of market data began in the third quarter of and persisted through the lack of liquidity in the market during the third and fourth quarters of created additional challenges when estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments 
generally  the securities most affected by the lack of liquidity are those securities classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the lack of liquidity in specific types of securities caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction and that also acknowledged illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded in the market 
the discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument  market indices  and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and or market activity was available 
in certain instances  the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest  however  the lack of liquidity resulted in discounts on the value of certain securities ranging from to or even higher in some cases 
the current illiquid market is requiring discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield  as well as account for the extended duration risk from the repayment of the instrument 
the discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to i observable transactions  when available  ii other securities on a relative basis  or iii the bid ask spread of non binding broker indicative bids 
for certain securities  particularly non investment grade mbs  a reasonable market discount rate could not be determined using those methodologies  and therefore dollar prices were established based on market intelligence 
pricing services and broker quotes were obtained when available to assist in estimating the fair value of level instruments 
the number of quotes we obtained varied based on the number of brokers following a particular security  but generally two to four quotes were obtained  however  the ability to obtain broker quotes or indications declined throughout the year and particularly during the fourth quarter 
we gained an understanding of the information used by these third party pricing sources to develop these estimated values 
the information obtained from third party pricing sources was evaluated and relied upon based on the degree of market transactions supporting the price indications and the firmness of the price indications 
in most cases  the current market conditions caused the price indications to be non binding and supported by very limited to no recent market activity 
in those instances  we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instrument s fair value 
generally  pricing services values and broker quotes obtained on level instruments were indications of value based on price indications  market intelligence  and proprietary cash flow modeling techniques but could not otherwise be supported by recent trades due to the illiquidity in the markets 
these values were evaluated in relation to other securities  other broker indications  as well as our independent knowledge of the security s collateral 
it is important to note that we believe that we evaluated all available information to estimate the value of level assets 
the decline in the amount of third party information available  particularly in the third and fourth quarters  necessitated the further use of internal models when valuing level instruments 
all of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provides a range of estimated values  which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that  based on management s judgment  represented a reasonable estimate of the instrument s fair value 
it was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely  in such cases  we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect 
we evaluate the amount of realized gains or losses upon disposition of level securities relative to our most recent mark to support the accuracy of the judgments made by management in estimating the value of illiquid securities 
beginning in the first quarter of  management established a level valuation working group to evaluate the available information pertaining to certain securities and ultimately develop a consensus estimate of the instrument s fair value 
the 
table of contents process involves the gathering of multiple sources of information  including broker quotes  values provided by pricing services  trading activity in other similar securities  market indices  and internal cash flow and pricing matrix estimates 
participation on this working group includes the business or functional area that manages the instrument  market risk  and finance  including the independent price verification function 
pricing estimates are derived on most illiquid instruments weekly and at a minimum monthly  and the working group formally reviews the pricing information at least quarterly 
these reviews also include assessing an instrument s classification in the fair value hierarchy based on the significance of the unobservable assumptions used to estimate the fair value 
we used significant unobservable inputs level to fair value certain trading assets  securities available for sale  portfolio loans accounted for at fair value  interest rate lock commitments irlcs  loans held for sale  derivatives  and public debt

securities available for sale and trading assets our level securities available for sale include instruments totaling approximately billion at december  including fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  as well as certain municipal bond securities  which are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market  as such  no significant observable market data for these instruments is available 
these nonmarketable securities total approximately million at december  level trading assets total approximately billion at december   which includes the coke common stock forward sale derivative valued at approximately million at december   as well as approximately million of small business administration sba loans and pooled securities whose payment is guaranteed by the us government 
the remaining level securities  both trading assets and available for sale securities  totals approximately billion at december  and are predominantly residual and other interests retained from company sponsored participations or securitizations of commercial loans and residential mortgage loans  investments in sivs  and mbs and abs collateralized by a variety of underlying assets including residential mortgages  corporate obligations  and commercial real estate for which little or no market activity exists or whose value of the underlying collateral is not market observable 
we have also increased our exposure to bank trust preferred abs  student loan abs  and municipal securities as a result of our offer to purchase certain ars as a result of failed auctions 
while the majority of the collateral in the remaining level securities continues to be residential mortgages  exposure is widely spread across prime first and second lien mortgages  as well as subprime first and second lien mortgages that were originated from through 
table of contents ars purchased since the auction rate market began failing in february have all been considered level securities 
we classify ars as securities available for sale or trading securities 
ars include municipal bonds  nonmarketable preferred equity securities  and abs collateralized by student loans or trust preferred bank obligations 
under a functioning ars market  ars could be remarketed with tight interest rate caps to investors targeting short term investment securities that repriced generally every to days 
unlike other short term instruments  these ars do not benefit from back up liquidity lines or letters of credit  and therefore  as auctions began to fail  investors were left with securities that were more akin to longer term  year  illiquid bonds  with the anticipation that auctions will continue to fail in the foreseeable future 
the combination of materially increased tenors  capped interest rates and general market illiquidity has had a significant impact on the risk profiles and market values of these securities and has resulted in the use of valuation techniques and models that rely on significant inputs that are largely unobservable 
at december   we hold siv assets which are in receivership and are carried at a fair value of approximately million 
in addition  we hold corporate bond exposure to lehman brothers  which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings  that is carried at a fair value of approximately million 
at december   level abs and mbs that we own were downgraded during the year ended december  due to continued deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying collateral and in many cases  the downgrade of a monoline insurer of the security 
the fair value of the downgraded securities totaled approximately million at december  and includes million of first lien mortgages  million of second lien mortgages  million of trust preferred bank obligations  million of student loan ars  and million of special purpose vehicles spv repackaged risk 
we recognized additional unrealized losses of approximately million for the year ended december  on these downgraded securities 
there is also approximately million of unrealized losses that have not been recognized in earnings related to two mbs available for sale that were downgraded in  but continue to maintain an investment grade rating 
we have evaluated these securities for impairment and believe all contractual principal and interest payments will be received timely for these securities  and therefore  have taken no impairment through earnings 
if future performance in the underlying collateral of abs and mbs further declines  we would anticipate additional downgrades and valuation reductions  as well as other than temporary impairment adjustments 
residual and other retained interests classified as securities available for sale or trading securities are valued based on internal models which incorporate assumptions  such as prepayment speeds and estimated credit losses  which are not market observable 
generally  we attempt to obtain pricing for our securities from a third party pricing provider or third party brokers who have experience in valuing certain investments 
this pricing may be used as either direct support for our valuation or used to validate outputs from our own proprietary models 
although third party price indications have been available for the majority of the securities  limited trading activity makes it difficult to support the observability of these quotations 
therefore  we evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as trades we executed during the quarter  market information received from outside market participants and analysts  or changes in the underlying collateral performance 
when third party pricing is not available to corroborate pricing information received  we will use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate fair value  and will consider assumptions such as relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
the asset backed securities indices abx indices have a high correlation to subprime  second lien and certain alt a exposures  particularly for the direct residential mbs exposure where vintage and collateral type are more easily determined 
as such  the dollar prices and corresponding discount margins from the abx indices are a relevant market data point to consider when estimating the fair value of certain abs 
we will also consider premiums or discounts relative to an index based on information we have obtained from our trades of similar assets and other information made available to us 
the use of abx indices to value certain level abs was minimal at december  as the size of our exposure to these types of assets has decreased through sales and paydowns or as other market information becomes available to use in estimations of fair value 
we also may use abx indices  as well as other synthetic indices such as the credit derivatives index cdx and commercial mortgage backed securities index cmbx  when valuing collateral underlying cdo and siv assets as an input to assist in determining overall valuation of the cdo or siv security owned 
pricing on these securities declined significantly due to the significant widening in these indices for year ended december  due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level securities  these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility 
in many instances  pricing assumptions for level securities may fall within an acceptable range of values 
in those cases  we attempt to consider all information to determine the most appropriate price within that range 
improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us  including a comparison of actual sales prices to the most recent value placed on the asset prior to sale to validate our pricing methodologies 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately billion of level abs  and received approximately million through the settlement proceeding of one siv under enforcement  providing us with relevant and timely market data to utilize in determining 
table of contents an appropriate value for similar abs remaining in the portfolio 
sales  trading and settlement activity were scarce in the fourth quarter of  however  we maintained consistency in our pricing methodology and processes  and incorporated any relevant changes to the valuation assumptions needed to ensure a supportable value for these illiquid securities at december  during  we recognized through earnings million in net trading and securities losses related to trading assets and securities available for sale classified as level while we believe we have utilized all pertinent market data in establishing an appropriate fair value for our securities  current market conditions result in wide price ranges used to evaluate market value 
while it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities  we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level this assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral  which is experiencing elevated losses but not to the degree that correlates to current market values  which is pressured downward in this market due to liquidity issues and other broad macroeconomic conditions 
it is reasonably likely that this market volatility will continue as a result of a variety of factors  including but not limited to economic conditions  the restructuring of sivs  and third party sales of securities  some of which could be large scale 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of level abs  mbs  ars and corporate debt  including the million lehman brothers bond  of which million of abs  mbs  ars  and corporate debt was classified as trading securities and million of ars was classified as securities available for sale 
we also purchased stock in the fhlb and federal reserve bank of approximately million  which is classified as level available for sale securities 
in addition  million of trading abs  million of available for sale abs  million of sba trading loans and pools and billion of the public debt at fair value were transferred into level during the year ended december  due to the absence of significant observable pricing data 
since the transfer into level  we have purchased million of sba loans 
loans and loans held for sale level loans are primarily non agency residential mortgage loans held for investment or loans held for sale for which there is little to no observable trading in either the new issuance or secondary loan markets as either whole loans or as securities 
prior to the non agency residential loan market disruption  which began during the third quarter of and continues  we were able to obtain certain observable pricing from either the new issuance or secondary loan market 
however  as the markets deteriorated and certain loans were not actively trading as either whole loans or as securities  we began employing the same alternative valuation methodologies used to value level residential mortgage securities  as described previously  to fair value the loans 
we recognized million and million in net losses through earnings during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to level loans and loans held for sale  excluding irlcs 
during the years ended december  and  we transferred million and million  respectively  of mortgage loans held for sale into level due to the determination that there was no longer a liquid market for valuing certain loan types 
on may   we acquired of the outstanding common shares of gb t 
we elected to account for million of the acquired loans  which were classified as nonaccrual  at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
upon acquisition  the loans had a fair value of million 
these loans are primarily commercial real estate loans which do not trade in an active secondary market  and as such  are considered level instruments 
as these loans are all classified as nonperforming  cash proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral is the expected source of repayment for the majority of these loans 
in order to fair value these loans  we utilized market data  when available  as well as internal assumptions  to derive fair value estimates of the underlying collateral 
during the year ended december   we recorded through earnings a loss of million on these loans 
on december   primarily as a result of paydowns  payoffs  and transfers to oreo  the loans had a fair value of million 
derivatives most derivative instruments are level or level instruments  except for the irlcs discussed below 
in addition  the equity forward agreements we entered into related to our investment in coke common stock are level instruments within the fair value hierarchy of sfas no 
 due to the unobservability of a significant assumption used to value these instruments 
because the value is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the coke common shares  a black scholes model is the appropriate valuation model 
most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market  such as the per share market price of coke common stock  interest rates and the dividend rate on coke common stock 
volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement 
the derivatives carried scheduled terms of approximately six and a half and seven years from the effective date  and as such  the observable and active options market on coke does not provide for any identical or 
table of contents similar instruments 
as a result  we receive estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about coke equity derivatives and is active in the market 
based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures as well as our own valuation assessment procedures  we have satisfied ourselves that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in arriving at the fair value of the agreements 
at december   the agreements were in an asset position to us of approximately million 
the fair value of our irlcs  while based on interest rates observable in the market  is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans 
these pull through rates are based on our historical data and reflect an estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan 
as a result of the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 servicing value  beginning in the first quarter of  was also included in the fair value of irlcs 
the fair value of msrs is determined by projecting cash flows which are then discounted to estimate an expected fair value 
the fair value of msrs is impacted by a variety of factors  including prepayment assumptions  discount rates  delinquency rates  contractual specified servicing fees and underlying portfolio characteristics 
because these inputs are not transparent in market trades  msrs are considered to be level assets in the valuation hierarchy 
long term debt we have elected to carry at fair value billion par of our publicly issued  fixed rate debt 
the debt consists of a number of different issuances that carry coupon rates ranging from to  resulting in a weighted average rate of  and maturities from may  through april   resulting in a weighted average life of years 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized net gains of million and million  respectively  in trading gains associated with the fair value changes in the debt and related derivatives and trading securities that provide an economic offset to the change in the value of the debt 
credit spreads widened throughout in connection with the continued deterioration of the broader financial markets and a number of failures in the financial services industry 
further fluctuations in our credit spreads are likely to occur in the future based on instrument specific and broader market conditions 
to mitigate the prospective impact of spread tightening  we completed the repurchase of a portion of our fair value debt of approximately million during the year ended december  we also hold approximately million of fixed rate corporate bonds referencing financial services companies to provide some level of offset to the changes in our credit spreads 
we entered into pay fixed receive float interest rate swaps to offset the changes in fair value of those corporate bonds due to interest rate movement 
to mitigate the impact of fair value changes on our debt due to interest rate movement  we generally enter into interest rate swaps  however  at times  we may also purchase fixed rate agency mbs to achieve this offset in interest rates 
there were no agency mbs held as of december  for this purpose 
see the trading assets and liabilities section included in the md a for more information 
we value this debt by obtaining quotes from a third party pricing service and utilizing broker quotes to corroborate the reasonableness of those market values 
in addition  information from market data of recent observable trades and indications from buy side investors  if available  are taken into consideration as additional support for the mark 
during the third and fourth quarters of  there were few trades to reference  and therefore  given the continued lack of liquidity for these types of instruments  both in the secondary markets and for primary issuances  this debt was transferred from a level to a level classification in the fair value hierarchy effective july  overall  the financial impact of the level financial instruments did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital 
we acquired certain abs from affiliates during the fourth quarter of using our existing liquidity position  and since purchasing the securities  we have received approximately billion in cash consideration from paydowns  settlements  sales and maturities of these securities 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in net losses through earnings due to the change in the fair value of level assets and liabilities  excluding irlcs 
some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes 
most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets  and therefore whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity 
if the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines  we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis 
for purposes of computing regulatory capital  mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital 

table of contents investment in common shares of the coca cola company background we have owned common shares of coke since  when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of coke s initial public offering and received common shares of coke in lieu of underwriting fees 
these shares have grown in value over the past years and have been classified as available for sale securities  with unrealized gains  net of tax  recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares  we have accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity 
as of december   our total holdings of approximately million coke shares had an accounting cost basis of  and a fair value of approximately billion 
as of december   as a result of the transactions discussed herein  we owned million coke shares with an accounting cost basis of  and a fair market value of approximately billion 
we established a target tier capital ratio of in and commenced a comprehensive balance sheet review initiative in early in an effort to improve liquidity and capital efficiency 
as part of this initiative  we began to formally evaluate the capital efficiency of our holdings of coke common shares  as we were prohibited from including the market value of our investment in coke common shares in tier capital in accordance with federal reserve capital adequacy rules 
executed multi step strategy as we reported in connection with our financial results for the quarter ended june   we sold million coke common shares  or approximately of our holdings at that time  in an open market sale 
at that time  we also announced publicly that we were evaluating various strategies to address our remaining coke common shares 
in the second and third quarters of  we completed the following three part strategy with respect to our remaining million common shares of coke i a market sale of million shares  ii a charitable contribution of approximately million shares to the suntrust foundation and iii the execution of equity forward agreements on million shares 
our primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits we obtained from our long term holding of this asset  including the capital treatment by bank regulators 
i 
market sale during the second quarter of  we sold million coke common shares in the market 
these sales  which resulted in an increase of approximately million  or approximately basis points  to tier capital  generated approximately million in net cash proceeds and an after tax gain of approximately million that was recorded in our financial results for the quarter ended june  this transaction will result in foregone dividend income of approximately per share in annual earnings per share and gave rise to a current tax liability with a marginal rate of just over 
ii 
contribution to the suntrust foundation in july  we contributed approximately million coke common shares to the suntrust foundation  which was reflected as a contribution expense of million in our financial results for the quarter ended september  as the gain from this contribution is non taxable  the only impact to our net income was the release of the deferred tax liability of approximately million net of valuation allowance 
this contribution increased tier capital in the third quarter by approximately million  or approximately basis points 
this gain and resultant increase to tier capital were reflected in our third quarter results  as we had not made any commitments or entered into any other transactions as of june  that would have required us to record this contribution in the second quarter 
this contribution will result in foregone dividend income of approximately per share in annual earnings per share 
we expect this contribution to act as an endowment for the suntrust foundation to make grants to charities operating within our footprint for years to come and reduce our ongoing charitable contribution expense 
this transaction was treated as a discrete item for income tax provision purposes and significantly lowered the effective tax rate for the third quarter of iii 
equity forward agreements the final piece of the strategy related to the remaining million coke common shares and was executed in july we entered into two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective july  with a major  unaffiliated financial institution the counterparty collectively covering our million coke shares the agreements 
under the agreements  we must deliver to the counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares 
the counterparty is obligated to settle the agreements for no less than approximately per share  or approximately billion in the aggregate the minimum proceeds 
the share forward agreements give us the 
table of contents right  but not the obligation  to sell to the counterparty  at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement  any of the million coke common shares that are not delivered to the counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements 
the agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our million coke common shares at a price no less than approximately per share  while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the coke common shares up to approximately per share and approximately per share  under each of the respective agreements 
during the terms of the agreements  and until we sell the million coke common shares  we generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by coke and will have the right to vote such shares 
however  the amounts payable to us under the agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends are not equal to expected amounts 
contemporaneously with entering into the agreements  the counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by suntrust bank and suntrust banks  inc collectively  the notes in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the minimum proceeds 
the notes carry stated maturities of approximately ten years from the effective date and bear interest at one month libor plus a fixed spread 
the counterparty pledged the notes to us and we pledged the million coke common shares to the counterparty  securing each entity s respective obligations under the agreements 
the pledged coke common shares are held by an independent third party custodian and the counterparty is prohibited under the agreements from selling  pledging  assigning or otherwise using the pledged coke common shares in its business 
we generally may not prepay the notes 
the interest rate on the notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of the agreements  either through a remarketing process or based upon dealer quotations 
in the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the notes  we would be required to collateralize the notes and the maturity of the notes may accelerate to the first anniversary of the settlement of the agreements 
however  we presently believe that it is substantially certain that the notes will be successfully remarketed 
the agreements carry scheduled settlement terms of approximately seven years from the effective date 
however  we have the option to terminate the agreements earlier with the approval of the federal reserve 
the agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default  extraordinary events regarding coke and other typical termination events 
upon such early termination  there could be exit costs or gains  such as certain breakage fees including an interest rate make whole amount  associated with both the agreements and the notes 
such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that are unknown 
however  the payment of such costs  if any  will not result in us receiving less than the minimum proceeds from the agreements 
we expect to sell all of the coke common shares upon settlement of the agreements  either under the terms of the agreements or in another market transaction 
see note  derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the transactions 
the federal reserve determined that we may include in tier capital  as of the effective date of the agreements  an amount equal to the minimum proceeds minus the deferred tax liability associated with the ultimate sale of the million coke common shares 
accordingly  the agreements resulted in an increase in tier capital during the third quarter of approximately million or an estimated basis points as of the transaction date 
deposits table composition of average deposits year ended december percent of total dollars in millions noninterest bearing now accounts money market accounts savings consumer time other time total consumer and commercial deposits brokered deposits foreign deposits total deposits average consumer and commercial deposits increased during by billion  or  compared to the growth was in now  money market  and other time deposits which  in aggregate  increased billion  or 
the increase was 
table of contents partially offset by declines in savings  noninterest bearing dda  and consumer time account balances 
savings accounts declined billion  or  noninterest bearing dda declined billion  or  and consumer time accounts declined billion  or 
the decline in these products was the result of deposit migration to higher cost money market accounts reflecting consumer sentiment favoring liquidity  safety and soundness  and higher rates than traditional checking and savings products 
average brokered and foreign deposits decreased by billion  or  during compared to the decrease was due to our efforts to reduce our reliance upon wholesale funding sources and may continue to decline in due to recent alternative funding sources 
consumer and commercial deposit growth is one of our key initiatives  as we focus on deposit gathering opportunities across all lines of business throughout the geographic footprint 
initiatives to attract deposits included the my cause campaign which provides enrollment incentives to depositors  the modification of incentive plans to place greater emphasis on deposit and package account sales  enhancing online banking products  and partnering with other well known brands in deposit oriented promotions 
we also significantly improved our pricing process and product structure in  which provided us with enhanced capability to price our products differentially across different parts of our footprint 
despite the larger mix of higher cost deposit products  primarily driven by market dynamics  this enhancement was critical as we not only lowered our interest expense on deposits  but also grew customer deposits during the my cause campaign  which generated over million checking accounts during  ended in the fourth quarter of  and we launched the live solid 
bank solid 
branding and marketing campaign to improve our visibility in the marketplace 
it is designed to speak to what is important to clients in the current environment and to inspire customer loyalty and capitalize on some of the opportunities presented by the new banking landscape 
as of december  securities pledged as collateral for deposits totaled billion 
other short term borrowings and long term debt other short term borrowings increased billion  or  from december  to billion at december  the change in other short term borrowings was primarily a result of our participation in the federal reserve s fed taf in november and december of the fed announced in october that it would offer expanded taf funds availability during the fourth quarter of we purchased billion in three month funding under the taf in support of the fed s initiative 
long term debt increased billion  or  from december  to billion at december  the change in long term debt was primarily the result of our participation  in december  in the fdic s tlgp under which we issued billion in debt that was guaranteed by the fdic under the terms of the program 
our decision to participate in the program was a result of being able to obtain a lower cost funding source than other borrowing channels available to us as a result of the guarantee provided on the issued debt by the us government agency 
we have approximately billion in capacity remaining under this program and are reasonably likely to issue the additional billion in long term debt under the program during the first or second quarter of capital resources table capital ratios as of december dollars in millions tier capital total capital risk weighted assets risk based ratios tier capital total capital tier leverage ratio total shareholders equity to assets tier capital includes trust preferred obligations of billion at the end of  billion at the end of  billion at the end of  billion at the end of and  and billion at the end of tier capital also includes qualifying minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries of million at the end of  million at the end of  million at the end of  million at the end of  million at the end of and our primary regulator  the federal reserve  measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies 
the guidelines weigh assets and off balance sheet risk exposures risk weighted assets according to predefined classifications  creating a base from which to compare capital levels 
tier capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments  less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
total capital consists of tier capital and tier capital  which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt  allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 

table of contents both the company and suntrust bank the bank are subject to a minimum tier capital and total capital ratios of and  respectively  of risk weighted assets 
to be considered well capitalized  ratios of and  respectively  are required 
additionally  the company and the bank are subject to tier leverage ratio requirements  which measures tier capital against average assets 
the minimum and well capitalized ratios are and  respectively 
in light of the current economic environment and the uncertainty with respect to the depth and duration of the recession  we believe that it is prudent to hold capital in excess of our target 
as such  we steadily built our capital position throughout the year through several strategically planned actions which are detailed below 
in the first quarter of  we issued million of trust preferred securities  which qualified as tier capital  and million of subordinated notes  which favorably impacted our total capital ratio 
in the second quarter of  we sold million shares of coke common stock  which increased tier capital by million as of the transaction date 
see additional discussion in investment in common shares of the coca cola company in this md a for further discussion 
in the third quarter of  we executed two transactions that included million shares of coke common stock that generated approximately million  or basis points  of additional tier capital as of the transaction date 
see additional discussion in investment in common shares of the coca cola company in this md a for further discussion 
in the fourth quarter of  we participated in the treasury s capital purchase program by issuing billion in preferred stock and related warrants to the treasury under the eesa 
initially  we issued billion in preferred stock to build up our capital position to what we believed to be prudent levels given the uncertainty in the economy 
as a result of a significant deterioration in the economy in the fourth quarter  we chose to issue an additional billion in preferred stock  which represented our remaining capacity under the capital purchase program 
refer to our discussion in liquidity risk within this md a for additional information regarding the terms of these securities 
in an effort to preserve capital  the board voted to reduce the quarterly common stock dividend by starting with the fourth quarter dividend which was per common share 
in january  we made the decision to further reduce our quarterly common stock dividend to per common share due to the credit and earnings environment that has deteriorated further since the original reduction of the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of our decision to reduce the common stock dividend was not made lightly  but we ultimately believed it was the responsible action to take in light of the further deterioration of the economy 
on an ongoing basis  we will reevaluate the common stock dividend  to balance prudence in our capital levels with the long run view of the profitability of the bank and our desire to return a portion of our earnings to the shareholders 
our decision to issue the preferred stock to the treasury was made to enhance our already solid capital position and to allow us to further expand our business 
the decision was primarily made as a result of worsening economic indicators occurring in the fourth quarter suggesting a recession that will endure longer than originally anticipated causing us to believe it prudent to have the additional capital during the potentially challenging economic times ahead 
as a result of the worsening economic environment  we decided to issue the additional billion in preferred stock due to an internal analysis of capital and liquidity that considered several factors 
as we were also evaluating acquisition activity and opportunities  we reached the conclusion that potential capital requirements were more significant than previously thought due to asset and loan values that had declined further 
in addition  we wanted to ensure adequate capital would be readily available to meet the borrowing needs of clients and prospects in the coming months and noted that most of our regional banking competitors had issued the maximum amount of preferred stock under the program  potentially putting us at a competitive disadvantage had we not obtained the additional capital 
we have developed strategies and tactics to deploy the capital in a fashion that balances supporting economic stability  safety and soundness  and earnings dilution 
specifically  we have deployed the additional capital thus far by increasing our loans and agency mbs holdings  as well as in decreasing short term borrowings 
the tier capital and total capital ratios improved from and  respectively  at december  to and at december  the primary drivers of the increase were several coke common stock transactions executed during the second and third quarters  as well as our participation in the capital purchase program in the fourth quarter  as mentioned above 
the tier capital ratio also benefited from an overall reduction in risk weighted assets 
the reduction in risk weighted assets occurred  in part due to an ongoing effort to reduce illiquid trading securities  construction related loans and commitments  and more generally to ensure that unused commitments are efficiently utilized 
also  in the third quarter of  the tier capital ratio improved due to increasing the granularity of certain loan related data to identify assets eligible for a lower risk weighting under applicable regulations 

table of contents tangible equity to tangible assets increased to as of december  from last year 
the increase was primarily due to the issuance of the preferred stock to the treasury 
tangible common equity to tangible assets declined basis points to as of december  the decline is primarily the result of a billion increase in tangible assets 
this increase relates to cash and securities from the temporary deployment of proceeds received from the issuance of preferred stock and debt securities  as well as billion of unsettled sales of securities available for sale that settled in january  increasing tangible common equity to tangible assets approximately basis points

to manage the major risks that we face and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved  we have established an enterprise risk governance process and established the suntrust enterprise risk program serp 
moreover  we have policies and various risk management processes designed to effectively identify  monitor and manage risk 
we continually refine and enhance our risk management policies  processes and procedures to maintain effective risk management and governance  including identification  measurement  monitoring  control  mitigation and reporting of all material risks 
over the last several years  we have enhanced risk measurement applications and systems capabilities that provide management information on whether we are being appropriately compensated for the risk profile we have adopted 
we balance our strategic goals  including revenue and profitability objectives  with the risks associated with achieving our goals 
effective risk management is an important element supporting our business decision making 
corporate risk management s focus is on synthesizing  assessing  reporting and mitigating the full set of risks at the enterprise level  and providing senior management with a holistic picture of the organization s risk profile 
we have implemented an enterprise risk management framework that has improved our ability to manage our aggregate risk profile 
at the core of the framework is our risk vision and risk mission 
risk vision to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities that are consistent with those of top tier financial institutions and that support the needs of suntrust business units 
risk mission to measure  monitor and manage risk throughout the suntrust footprint to ensure that risk at the transaction  portfolio and institution levels is viewed consistently in order to optimize risk adjusted return decision making 
the board of directors is wholly responsible for oversight of our corporate risk governance process 
the risk committee of the board assists the board of directors in executing this responsibility 
the chief risk officer cro reports to the chief executive officer and is responsible for the oversight of the corporate risk management organization as well as the risk governance processes 
the cro provides overall leadership  vision and direction for our enterprise risk management framework 
in addition  the cro provides regular risk assessments to the risk committee of the board and to the full board of directors  and provides other information to executive management and the board  as requested 

table of contents the risk governance framework incorporates a variety of senior management risk related committees 
these committees are responsible for ensuring adequate risk measurement and management in their respective areas of authority 
these committees include corporate risk committee crc  asset liability management committee alco  corporate product risk assessment committee prac  and the serp steering committee 
the crc is chaired by the cro and supports the cro in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile 
the crc consists of various senior executives and meets on a monthly basis 
organizationally  we measure and manage risk according to the three traditional risk disciplines of credit risk  market risk including liquidity risk and operational risk including compliance risk 
corporate risk programs are managed by the chief wholesale credit officer and chief retail credit officer for credit risk  the chief market risk officer for market risk  and the chief operational risk officer for operational risk 
the three risk disciplines are managed on a consolidated basis under our enterprise risk management framework  which also takes into consideration legal and reputation risk factors 
within each line of business and corporate function is a risk manager and support staff whose primary role is to drive effective risk management practices throughout the business organization 
these risk managers  who report on a dotted line to the chief operational risk officer  facilitate communications with corporate risk functions and execute the requirements of the enterprise risk management framework and policies 
corporate risk management works in partnership with the risk managers to ensure alignment with sound risk management practices as well as industry best practices 
in  we continued to make significant enhancements to our corporate risk management function 
the model validation and performance measurement groups continued to provide assurance that risks inherent in model development and usage are properly identified and managed to oversee the calculation of economic capital 
risk identification  assessment and mitigation planning were formally incorporated into the strategic planning process 
serp continues to ensure that the approach and plans for risk management are aligned to the vision and mission of corporate risk management in addition to managing regulatory compliance 
in addition  the serp goal is to ensure our future compliance with the basel ii capital accord 
key objectives of serp include incorporating risk management principles that encompass our values and standards and are designed to guide risk taking activity  maximizing performance through the balance of risk and reward and leveraging initiatives driven by regulatory requirements to deliver capabilities to better measure and manage risk 
credit risk management credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments  including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases  contingent exposures from unfunded commitments  letters of credit  credit derivatives  and counterparty risk under derivative products 
as credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients  the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy 
the credit risk management group manages and monitors extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews 
they maintain underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures 
the corporate risk review unit conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures 
credit risk management periodically reviews our lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies 
in addition  total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored 
credit risk is partially mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as credit default swaps 
borrower counterparty obligor risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology  which has been implemented in all lines of business 
we use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses 
these models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience 
to the extent possible  we collect internal data to ensure the validity  reliability  and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation 
we have made a commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards 
as part of a continuous improvement process  credit risk management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools  implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures 
operational risk management we face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products 
coupled with external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  security risks  country risk  and legal risk  the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly 

table of contents we believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution 
our operational risk management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended to identify  assess  control  quantify  monitor  and report on operational risks company wide 
these efforts support our goals in seeking to minimize operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation 
operational risk management is overseen by our chief operational risk officer  who reports directly to the chief risk officer 
the corporate governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function 
these risk managers also report indirectly to the chief operational risk officer and are responsible for execution of the operational risk management program within their areas 
market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net interest income and economic value of equity eve to adverse movements in interest rates  is our primary market risk  and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet 
we are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities  msrs  loan warehouse and pipeline  and debt carried at fair value 
the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
the policies established by alco are reviewed and approved by our board of directors 
market risk from non trading activities the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within policy limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines established by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
the major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as repricing gap analysis 
one of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis  which is used to model net interest income from assets  liabilities  and derivative positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments 
this analysis incorporates several assumptions  the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios 
the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates  rate shocks  basis risk analysis  and yield curve twists 
each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer behavior in an interest rate scenario 
specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities 
the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous basis point move in benchmark interest rates 
estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
the net interest income profile reflects asset sensitivity with respect to an instantaneous basis point change in rates 
economic perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  
table of contents the december  net interest income sensitivity profiles include the impact from adopting sfas no 
specifically  the net interest payments from billion of receive fixed swaps are now reflected in trading income versus net interest income 
the benefit to net interest income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits and commissions 
the recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective above is different from a financial reporting perspective below due to the use of fair value accounting for these interest rate swaps and related underlying debt 
hence  the above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps  while the profile below does not include the net interest payments 
financial reporting perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  the difference from december  to seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to a basis point increase is primarily due to the significant decline in interest rates year over year and the increase in fixed rate funding 
we also perform valuation analysis  which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis 
whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon  valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions 
the valuation of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows  the net of which is referred to as eve 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
similar to the net interest income simulation  eve uses instantaneous changes in rates 
eve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model 
as with the net interest income simulation model  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the eve analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios 
we have implemented a new vendor risk management model for analysis of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines 
cash flows of these portfolios are particularly reliant on prepayment assumptions and we believe the new model offers a more robust and granular prepayment model relative to the previous model 
further  the new model is able to provide daily analysis using updated market information  thus enhancing the risk management process 
for these reasons  cash flow sensitivity analysis of trading securities and securities available for sale  issued public debt securities  derivatives  residential mortgage loans  home equity lines  and msrs has also been transitioned to the new model 
comparable eve profiles as of december  using both models are provided  in addition to prior year information under the previous model 
new model rate shock basis points estimated change in eve december  previous model rate change basis points estimated change in eve december  december  
table of contents the change in the comparable eve profile from december  to december  can be attributed to the net impact of lower interest rates  lower pricing sensitivity on indeterminate maturity deposit products and lower valuations of loans  deposits and msrs 
the difference between the two profiles at december  is as a result of slower prepayments in the aforementioned models 
this change in prepayments caused the value sensitivity of assets to interest rates in the new model to be greater than that of liabilities  while the value sensitivity of assets to rates in the previous model remained lower than that of liabilities 
while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments  the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie  the current fiscal year 
further  eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth  changes in product mix  changes in yield curve relationships  and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates 
the net interest income simulation and eve analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates 
trading activities beginning in and continuing into  we expanded the use of trading securities as part of our overall balance sheet management strategies 
the remainder of our actively traded securities  other than corporate treasury trading securities  are primarily held to support customer requirements through our broker dealer subsidiary 
product offerings to clients include debt securities  loans traded in the secondary market  equity securities  derivatives and foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments 
other trading activities include acting as a market maker in certain debt and equity securities and related derivatives 
typically  we maintain a securities inventory to facilitate customer transactions 
also in the normal course of business  we assume a degree of market risk in proprietary trading  hedging  and other strategies  subject to specified limits 
we have developed policies and procedures to manage market risk associated with trading  capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a value at risk var approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign exchange risk  spread risk and volatility risk 
for trading portfolios  var measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position  given a specified confidence level and time horizon 
var exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio 
our var calculation measures the potential losses using a confidence level with a one day holding period 
this means that  on average  losses are expected to exceed var two or three times per year 
the following table displays high  low  and average var for and dollars in millions average var high var low var an increase in volatility in certain markets drove the increase in var during trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged billion for and billion for trading assets net of trading liabilities were billion at december  and billion at december  liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost 
we mitigate this risk by attempting to structure our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs 
for example  we attempt to structure our balance sheet so that less liquid assets  such as loans  are funded through stable funding sources  such as retail deposits  long term debt  wholesale deposits  and capital 
we assess liquidity needs arising from asset growth  maturing obligations  and deposit withdrawals  considering operations in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events 
in addition  we consider our off balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may drain liquidity in certain business environments 
our alco measures liquidity risks  sets policies to manage these risks  and reviews adherence to those policies 
for example  we manage reliance on short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by alco 
in addition  the risk committee of our board of directors sets liquidity limits and reviews current and forecasted liquidity positions at each of its regularly scheduled meetings 
we have a contingency funding plan that assesses liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades  rapid asset growth  and financial market disruptions 
we believe we have sufficient funding capacity to meet the liquidity needs arising from these potential events 
our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity 
these sources of contingent liquidity include 
table of contents capacity to borrow at the federal reserve discount window and from the fhlb system and the ability to sell  pledge or borrow against unencumbered securities in the investment portfolio 
as of december   the potential liquidity from these sources exceeded billion 
in addition  we may have the ability to raise funds by selling or securitizing loans  including single family mortgage loans 
uses and sources of funds 
our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit  the purchase of investment securities  working capital  and debt and capital service 
our sources of funds include a large  stable retail deposit base  various forms of wholesale funding  including access to the capital markets and secured advances from the fhlb  and access to the federal reserve discount window 
wholesale funding  particularly the unsecured variety  comes from uncommitted sources and is subject to market conditions and various risks and uncertainties 
our credit ratings are an important factor in our access to unsecured wholesale funds  and significant changes in these ratings could affect the cost and availability of these sources 
factors that affect our credit ratings include  but are not limited to  the credit risk profile of our assets  the adequacy of our loan loss reserves  the liquidity profile of both the bank and the parent company  and the adequacy of our capital base 
on january   standard poor s rating services lowered  by one rating  its long term counterparty credit ratings on suntrust banks  inc to a and suntrust bank to a  citing deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio 
consistent with this view  we consider the primary risk of downgrade to our credit ratings is the potential for additional material credit losses in our loan portfolio if the us economy does not begin to recover during from the current sharp  broad and sustained recession 
core deposits  primarily gathered from our retail branch network  are our largest and most cost effective source of funding 
core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december  these deposits averaged billion  or of the funding base  during  up from an average of during core deposits totaled billion at year end and increased billion during the fourth quarter 
growth in core deposits  along with an increase in term wholesale funding and balance sheet de leveraging  has reduced the bank s average daily overnight borrowing position materially over the past two years  resulting in a strong liquidity position 
as of december   the daily overnight borrowing position was zero 
much of the growth in core deposits occurred amidst a period of some consolidation in the banking industry  giving us reason to expect these new deposits will be stable 
we maintain access to a diversified base of wholesale funding sources 
these uncommitted sources include fed funds purchased from other banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  negotiable certificates of deposit  offshore deposits  fhlb advances  global bank notes  and commercial paper 
aggregate wholesale funding totaled billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  net short term unsecured borrowings  which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and fed funds purchased  totaled billion as of december   down from billion as of december  an additional source of wholesale liquidity is our access to the capital markets 
suntrust banks  inc the parent company maintains a registered debt shelf from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes  commercial paper and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock 
suntrust bank the bank maintains a global notes program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms 
as of december   the parent company had authority to issue an additional billion of securities under its shelf registration and the bank had authority to issue an additional billion of notes under the global bank note program 
borrowings under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors 
institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors  including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector 
parent company liquidity 
we measure parent company liquidity by comparing sources of liquidity from short term assets  such as unencumbered and other investment securities and cash  relative to short term liabilities  which include overnight sweep funds  seasoned long term debt and commercial paper 
as of december   the parent company had billion in such sources compared to short term debt of billion 
we also manage the parent company s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time 
a million parent company note matured in october and the next parent company debt maturity is million in october much of the parent company s liabilities are long term in nature  coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long term senior and subordinated notes 
the primary uses of parent company liquidity include debt service  dividends on capital  the periodic purchase of investment securities and loans to our subsidiaries 
we believe the parent company holds cash adequate to satisfy these working capital needs 
we fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiaries 
we are subject to both state and federal regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances 
in the context of an ongoing us economic recession and credit market turmoil in  we announced a reduction of our quarterly common stock dividend on october  from per share to per share and on january  to its current level of l per share 

table of contents recent market and regulatory developments 
recent financial market conditions have often made it difficult or uneconomical for banks and financial institutions to access the debt and equity capital markets 
as a result  the united states congress  the treasury  the federal reserve  and the fdic have announced various programs designed to enhance market liquidity and bank capital 
during the fourth quarter of the parent company received billion of preferred stock proceeds from the treasury s capital purchase program cpp  as described below 
by participating in the cpp we are prohibited from increasing our common stock dividend for three years unless i we have redeemed the treasury s preferred stock  ii the treasury has transferred all of such preferred stock  or iii the treasury consents to such increase 
this sale of preferred stock subjects us to certain conditions and agreements 
the preferred stock pays a cumulative dividend for the first five years  after which the dividend rate increases to 
the preferred stock is accompanied by year warrants to purchase up to million of our common stock at market value  based on the day average price prevailing at the time of issuance 
the treasury may transfer the preferred stock and warrants 
separately during the fourth quarter  the fdic implemented the tlgp under which banks and financial institutions can issue senior  unsecured debt guaranteed by the fdic 
in december  we issued billion of bank debt pursuant to the tlgp 
as of december   we retained approximately billion of capacity to issue additional debt under the tlgp rules then in force 
we expect to utilize this remaining capacity by issuing approximately billion before the tlgp has been announced to expire on october   however we note that at the time of drafting of this filing  the final regulations regarding tlgp have not yet been updated and is still scheduled to expire on june  during the fourth quarter of  we also participated in the federal reserve s taf and maintained outstanding borrowings of billion as of december  the taf has provided banks with a source of relatively inexpensive funding with a term of days or less 
we expect to continue to utilize the taf in the near term so long as the cost of funds remains attractive and or financial market conditions remain volatile and uncertain 
other liquidity considerations 
as detailed in table  we had an aggregate potential obligation of billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at december  commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to a customer who has complied with predetermined contractual obligations 
we also had billion in letters of credit as of december   most of which are standby letters of credit which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur 
approximately billion of these letters support variable rate demand obligations vrdos  municipal securities remarketed by us and other agents on a regular basis usually weekly 
in the event that we or the other agents are unable to remarket these securities  we would provide funding under the letters of credit 
certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent us from creating liens on  disposing of  or issuing except to related parties voting stock of subsidiaries 
further  there are restrictions on mergers  consolidations  certain leases  sales or transfers of assets  and minimum shareholders equity ratios 
as of december   we were and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements 
as of december   our cumulative utbs amounted to million 
interest related to utbs was million as of december  these utbs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with fin the utbs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and  if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid  the payments would be made from our normal  operating cash flows  likely over multiple years

other market risk other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market  commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market  and our investment in msrs 
we manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale ie  the warehouse and our irlcs on residential loans intended for sale 
the warehouses and irlcs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate loans 
the risk associated with the warehouses and irlcs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market  which is typically days 
we manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps  futures  and forward sale agreements  where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the irlcs 
the irlcs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and are not designated in sfas no 
hedge accounting relationships 
msrs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio 
the value of msrs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates  primarily the year current coupon par mortgage rate known as the par mortgage rate 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
we have not historically hedged msrs  but have managed the market risk through our overall asset liability management process with consideration to the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production that occurs as interest rates rise and fall over time with the economic cycle as well as with securities available for sale 
the precipitous drop in mortgage rates as evidenced by the decline in the par mortgage rate  down over basis points during the fourth quarter of  generated 
table of contents significantly higher expected prepayment speeds that resulted in an impairment of million of msrs 
this same decline in rates generated gains on mbs which were held in our available for sale securities portfolio

interest related to utbs was million as of december  we are under continuous examination by various tax authorities 
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict  with respect to periods for which the statutes of limitations are open  the amount of tax and interest if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment 
it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and are integral to understanding md a 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require our judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments  and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  valuing an asset or liability  or reducing a liability 
our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us gaap  and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses the alll represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the alll is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the alll is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the size and current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans ie  loans having similar characteristics within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
larger nonaccrual loans are individually evaluated to determine the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment  including the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition  or the loan s estimated market value 
in these measurements  we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio 
to the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations  our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific alll estimates 

table of contents general allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics  including smaller balance homogeneous loans 
the alll committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors  including net charge off trends  internal risk ratings  changes in internal risk ratings  loss forecasts  collateral values  geographic location  borrower fico scores  delinquency rates  nonperforming and restructured loans  origination channel  product mix  underwriting practices  industry conditions  and economic trends 
unallocated allowances relate to inherent losses that are not included elsewhere in the alll 
the qualitative factors associated with unallocated allowances are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment 
these factors include the inherent imprecision in mathematical models and credit quality statistics  recent economic uncertainty  losses incurred from recent events not reflected in general or specific allowances  and lagging or incomplete data 
during  additional analysis was performed to identify the loan pools most susceptible to the imprecision risk being captured by the unallocated allowance 
as of december   all of the unallocated allowance was assigned to specific loan pools 
our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the alll 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables  and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate alll 
as a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity  we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved  should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the alll 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for loan losses 
during and  we experienced increases in delinquencies and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market 
during  we began to identify and realize loan related losses that were due to borrower misrepresentations and insurance claim denials 
we classify these loans as operating losses instead of net charge offs applied against the alll  since the circumstances leading to the loss were the result of reasons other than a decline in the borrower s credit conditions 
reserves for this type of loss were estimated using recent historical loss experience data 
the alll and operating loss reserve considered the current market conditions in deriving the estimated reserves  however  given the continued economic uncertainty  the ultimate amount of loss  as well as classification of loss  could vary from that estimate 
for additional discussion of the alll see the provision for loan losses and allowance for loan and lease losses section in this md a  and for additional discussion of operating losses see the noninterest expense section in this md a 
estimates of fair value we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
the extent to which we use fair value on a recurring basis was significantly expanded upon the adoption of sfas no 
during the first quarter of examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments  available for sale and trading securities  certain investment portfolio and held for sale loans  certain issuances of long term debt  and certain residual interests from company sponsored securitizations 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with sfas no 
examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include loans held for sale accounted for at the lower of cost or market  msrs  oreo  goodwill  intangible assets  nonmarketable equity securities  and long lived assets 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 
these valuation techniques and assumptions are in accordance with sfas no 
and when applicable  fasb staff position fsp fas fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
estimating fair value in accordance with sfas no 
requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
where observable market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available  sfas no 
requires that we identify  what we believe to be  similar assets or liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including market based assumptions  such as interest rates  as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of nonperformance 
in certain cases  our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements 
the use of significant  unobservable inputs in our models is described in note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements 
in instances where required by us gaap  we use discount rates in our determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as retirement and other postretirement benefit obligations  loans carried at fair value  msrs  and residual interests from company sponsored securitizations 
discount rates used are those considered to be commensurate with the risks involved 
a change in these discount rates could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities 
the fair 
table of contents value of msrs is based on discounted cash flow analyses 
we provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure msrs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  to the consolidated financial statements 
a detailed discussion of key variables  including the discount rate  used in the determination of retirement and other postretirement obligations is contained in the pension accounting section below 
in estimating the fair values for investment securities and most derivative financial instruments  we believe that independent  third party market prices are the best evidence of exit price 
if such third party market prices are not available on the exact securities that we own  fair values are based on the market prices of similar instruments  third party broker quotes or are estimated using industry standard or proprietary models whose inputs may be unobservable 
when market observable data is not available  the valuation of financial instruments becomes more subjective and involves substantial judgment 
the need to use unobservable inputs generally results from the lack of market liquidity for certain types of loans and securities  which results in diminished observability of both actual trades and assumptions that would otherwise be available to value these instruments 
the distressed market conditions  that began in the third quarter of and continued through  have impacted our ability to obtain third party pricing data for certain of our investments 
even when third party pricing has been available  the reduced trading activity resulting from current market conditions has challenged the observability of these quotations 
when fair values are estimated based on internal models  we will consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
the fair values of loans held for investment recorded at fair value and loans held for sale are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade  as either whole loans or as abs 
when securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market  we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs  loan servicing fees  and various other transformation costs  when material 
the fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity 
when observable market prices are not available  for example as a result of the current illiquidity in the market for certain loan products  we will use judgment and estimate fair value using internal models 
when estimating fair value  we will make assumptions about prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and liquidity discounts 
absent comparable current market data  we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans 
the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties  less estimated selling costs 
estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
for long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in determining the fair value  management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates  the life of the asset  and or the market value of the assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis  or more often  if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
in  our reporting units were comprised of retail  commercial  commercial real estate  mortgage  corporate and investment banking  wealth and investment management  and affordable housing 
valuation techniques in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we primarily use discounted cash flow analyses  which require assumptions about short and long term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit  as well as discount rates 
in addition  in  we also applied guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available  to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units 
the guideline information was based on publicly available information 
a valuation multiple was selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit s benchmark result with the guideline information 
in addition to these financial considerations  qualitative factors such as asset quality  growth opportunities  and overall risk were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple used to estimate a value on a minority basis 
a control premium of was applied to the minority basis value to arrive at the reporting unit s estimated fair value on a controlling basis 
the values separately derived from each valuation technique ie  discounted cash flow  guideline company  and guideline transaction were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit s fair value 
generally  the discounted cash flow analysis was weighted and the market based approaches were weighted in the final estimated value 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

table of contents growth assumptions multi year financial forecasts were developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives  client service and retention standards  market share changes  anticipated loan and deposit growth  forward interest rates  historical performance  and industry and economic trends  among other considerations 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at in based on management s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp and inflation 
the sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections was compared to our market capitalization  on a control adjusted basis  in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return 
in connection with the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  the implied internal rate of return was 
this implied internal rate of return served as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit 
discount rate assumptions discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk premium  beta  and in some cases  unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
for the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units ranged from to 
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above  incorporating the related projections and assumptions 
as of september   the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors  including current economic and market conditions  recent  historical  and implied stock price volatility  marketplace dynamics such as level of short selling  company specific growth opportunities  and an implied control premium 
the implied control premium is determined by comparing the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization  measured over a reasonable period of time 
we compared the aggregate fair values of the reporting units as of september  and to our market capitalization and derived an implied control premium of approximately and  respectively 
the implied control premium was calculated using an average market capitalization based on five days before and after september  and we assessed the reasonableness of the implied control premium in relation to the market and historical factors previously mentioned  as well as recognizing that the size of the implied control premium is not  independently  a determinative measure to assess the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
in the current unprecedented market environment  the size of the implied control premium can vary significantly based on the economic and market conditions which may cause increased volatility in a company s stock price  resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization  however  current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participant s estimate of entity specific value measured over a more reasonable period of time 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions  therefore  in some instances minor changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
for example  a basis point increase in the discount rate and or decline in the cumulative cash flow projections of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value 
we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
ultimately  future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
in the case of our fourth quarter of updated goodwill impairment evaluation  we determined that it was possible that the fair value of the mortgage  commercial real estate  and corporate and investment banking reporting units was less than their respective carrying values as of december   due  in large part  to their exposure to residential real estate and capital markets  as well as the continued deterioration in the economy during the fourth quarter of in those situations where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value  an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed which involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including previously unrecognized intangible assets  is individually determined 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets is the implied goodwill 
the value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit s net assets 
the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following recent data observed in the market  including similar assets cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates market indices 
table of contents estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral price indications from independent third parties observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant 
the estimated fair values reflect management s assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit  liquidity  and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment 
currently  estimated liquidity and market risk premiums on certain loan categories ranged from to due to the distressed nature of the market  however  those values may not be indicative of the ultimate economic value of those assets 
for example  the fair value of the loans based on estimated future cash flows discounted at new origination rates for loans with similar terms and credit quality  ie discount rates exclusive of the market risk premium and liquidity discount derives an estimated fair value that approximates of the loans carrying value 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit  no goodwill impairment is recorded 
changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill 
in the case of separately estimating the implied goodwill for our mortgage  commercial real estate  and corporate and investment banking reporting units  the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities was estimated to be a net liability as of december   which caused the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to exceed its carrying value  resulting in no goodwill impairment 
the size of the implied goodwill was significantly affected by the estimated fair value of the loans pertaining to these reporting units 
the fair value estimate of these loan portfolios ranged from approximately to 
the estimated fair value of these loan portfolios is based on an exit price  and the assumptions used are intended to approximate those that a market participant would use in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction  including a market liquidity discount 
as previously mentioned  the significant market risk premium that is a consequence of the current distressed market conditions was a significant contributor to the valuation discounts associated with these loans 
however  it is possible that future changes in the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets could result in future goodwill impairment 
for example  to the extent that market liquidity returns and the fair value of the individual assets of a reporting unit increases at a faster rate than the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  that may cause the implied goodwill of a reporting unit to be lower than the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in goodwill impairment 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based upon a current estimate of net income  tax credits  non taxable income and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full year 
the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results 
we periodically evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of tax reserves related to each of these positions 
additionally  we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax asset positions based on expectations of future taxable income 
the evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters 
pension accounting several variables affect the annual pension cost and the annual variability of cost for our retirement programs 
the main variables are size and characteristics of the employee population  discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  recognition of actual asset returns  other actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost 
below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on our pension costs 
size and characteristics of the employee population pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans  and other factors including salary  age  years of employment  and benefit terms 
effective january   retirement plan participants who were employed as of 
table of contents december  ceased to accrue additional benefits under the existing pension benefit formula and their accrued benefits were frozen 
beginning january   participants who had fewer than years of service and future participants accrue future pension benefits under a cash balance formula that provides compensation and interest credits to a personal pension account 
participants with or more years of service as of december  were given the opportunity to choose between continuing a traditional pension benefit accrual under a reduced formula or participating in the new personal pension account 
the plan population decreased through due to the effects of a reorganization announced during discount rate the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  december  the discount rate for each plan is reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans  and keep all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and market projection of the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the retirement plans  the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was for and for this expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets 
we modified the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets for to be to reflect the reduction in pension trust equity exposure 
annual differences  if any  between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a corridor  as defined in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees  which is approximately seven years  or average future lifetime for plans with no active participants that are frozen 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans  holding all other actuarial assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
recognition of actual asset returns sfas no 
allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years 
however  we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost 
this method uses the actual market value of the plan assets 
therefore  we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost  as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience 
other actuarial assumptions to estimate the projected benefit obligation  actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate  and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors do not tend to change significantly over time  so the range of assumptions  and their impact on pension cost  is generally limited 
we periodically review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience 
the interest crediting rate applied to each personal pension account was in healthcare cost assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement plans 
due to changing medical inflation  it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
if we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a million and million increase  respectively 
if we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a million and million decrease  respectively 
to estimate the projected benefit obligation as of december   we projected forward the benefit obligations from january  to december   adjusting for benefit payments  expected growth in the benefit obligations  changes in key assumptions and plan provisions  and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year  including where appropriate subsidized early retirements  salary changes different from expectations  entrance of new participants  changes in per capita claims cost  medicare part d subsidy  and retiree contributions

table of contents fourth quarter results we reported a net loss available to common shareholders of million for the fourth quarter of  a decrease of million compared to the same period of the prior year 
diluted loss per average common share was for the fourth quarter of compared to diluted income of for the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter of results included net market valuation losses on illiquid financial instruments and our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value of approximately million and a provision for loan losses of million 
the loan loss provision was increased due to higher residential mortgage and residential construction net charge offs 
net interest income fte was  million for the fourth quarter of  an increase of million  or  from the fourth quarter of the increase was due to growth in average earning assets  an improved mix of loans and deposits  an increase in consumer and commercial deposits  and a decrease in wholesale funding during the fourth quarter 
while net interest margin grew nominally from in the fourth quarter of to for the same period of  we experienced an increase of basis points from the third quarter of provision for loan losses was million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of million from the fourth quarter of the provision for loan losses was million more than net charge offs for the fourth quarter of reflecting the dramatic decline in the state of the economy and  specifically  further deterioration in credit conditions of the residential mortgage and real estate construction portfolios 
total noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of  an increase of million  or  from the fourth quarter of this increase was primarily driven by the impact of the net market valuation losses of approximately million recorded in that declined to approximately million in partially offsetting the benefit of lower mark to market losses was lower mortgage production income and trust and investment management revenue in the fourth quarter of included net mark to market valuation losses in trading income of million related to illiquid trading securities and loans carried at fair value and losses of million related to the tightening of credit spreads on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value 
the fourth quarter of included losses of approximately million related to market value declines in abs  net of valuation gains on our debt carried at fair value 
although we had a decrease in valuation losses on mortgage loans carried at fair value or held for sale  noninterest income was negatively impacted by a decline in mortgage related income of million in the fourth quarter as reserves for losses associated with repurchases of mortgage loans increased approximately million and mortgage origination volume declined compared to the fourth quarter of offsetting the increase was a million net gain from the sale leaseback of branch and office properties recognized in the fourth quarter of net securities gains losses for the fourth quarter of also increased by million compared to the same period of due to the sale of mbs held in conjunction with our risk management strategies associated with hedging the values of msrs 
volatility in interest rates and increased loan prepayment speed estimates during the quarter resulted in a million impairment of msrs that were amortized at cost 
total noninterest expense was  million during the fourth quarter of  an increase of million  or  over the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily driven by growth in credit related expenses of approximately million which overshadowed the cost savings achieved from our efficiency and productivity initiatives 
included in the credit related expenses were operating losses  growing from million for fourth quarter of to million for the same period of  primarily related to increased reserves stemming from borrower misrepresentations and insurance claim denials  as well as million related to mortgage reinsurance reserves 
positively impacting the fourth quarter of was a decrease compared to of million in employee compensation expense and benefits 
the fourth quarter also benefited from a million expense reversal related to visa litigation  resulting from the recognition of the funding by visa of its litigation escrow account  compared to a million expense accrual for visa litigation in the same period of in the fourth quarter of  we recorded write downs of million related to affordable housing properties as compared to million of related charges in the fourth quarter of outside processing increased million  or  due to the outsourcing of certain back office operations in the third quarter of  which was more than offset by the corresponding decrease in employee compensation and benefits 
the income tax benefit for the fourth quarter of was million compared to the income tax benefit of million for the fourth quarter of the decrease in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the lower level of earnings and a higher proportion of tax exempt income  state tax benefits resulting from subsidiaries net operating losses and tax credits

for business segment reporting purposes  the basis of presentation in the accompanying discussion includes the following net interest income all net interest income is presented on an fte basis 
the revenue gross up has been applied to tax exempt loans and investments to make them comparable to other taxable products 
the segments have also been matched maturity funds transfer priced  generating credits or charges based on the economic value or cost created by the assets and liabilities of each segment 
the mismatch between funds credits and funds charges at the segment level resides in reconciling items 
the change in the matched maturity funds mismatch is generally attributable to the corporate balance sheet management strategies 
provision for loan losses represents net charge offs by segment 
the difference between the total segment net charge offs and the consolidated provision for loan losses is reported in reconciling items 
provision for income taxes calculated using a nominal income tax rate for each segment 
this calculation includes the impact of various income adjustments  such as the reversal of the fte gross up on tax exempt assets  tax adjustments and credits that are unique to each business segment 
the difference between the calculated provision for income taxes at the total segment level and the consolidated provision for income taxes is reported in reconciling items 
we continue to augment our internal management reporting methodologies 
currently  the segment s financial performance is comprised of direct financial results as well as various allocations that for internal management reporting purposes provide an enhanced view of analyzing the segment s financial performance 
the internal allocations include the following operational costs expenses are charged to the segments based on various statistical volumes multiplied by activity based cost rates 
as a result of the activity based costing process  planned residual expenses are also allocated to the segments 
the recoveries for the majority of these costs are in the corporate other and treasury segment 
support and overhead costs expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated based on various drivers eg  number of full time equivalent employees and volume of loans and deposits 
the recoveries for these allocations are in corporate other and treasury 
sales and referral credits segments may compensate another segment for referring or selling certain products 
the majority of the revenue resides in the segment where the product is ultimately managed 
the application and development of management reporting methodologies is a dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements 
the implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology may materially affect the net income disclosed for each segment with no impact on consolidated results 
whenever significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place  the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is reclassified wherever practicable 
we will reflect these changes in the current period and will update historical results 
at the end of  we announced certain management and organizational changes related to the lines of business 
this reorganization will strengthen the alignment between strategy development and execution
