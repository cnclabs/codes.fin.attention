our international strategies unit was our original core business 
our preparedness services  fraud and siu services  and security consulting and investigations units represent our three financial reporting segments 
our international strategies business unit  on the basis of its relative materiality  is included in our fraud and siu services segment 
the following table represents the revenue contribution by each of these three reporting segments as a percentage of our total revenues for the years ended december  segment preparedness services fraud and siu services security consulting and investigations total revenues principally  we generate our revenues through providing risk mitigation solutions to our clients 
for our preparedness services and security consulting and investigations engagements  we typically invoice on a time and materials basis 
for most of our fraud and siu services engagements  we invoice on a fixed fee basis 
we enter into contractual arrangements with most of our clients  on both an exclusive and non exclusive basis 
the duration of our engagements ranges from one week to two or more years 
over half of our revenues are generated from repeat client relationships that we have had for more than one year 
in addition to our services  we also generate revenues from the sale of kits and supplies principally used by law enforcement to collect dna materials 
generally  we must compete in the market for our clients based upon our reputation  service history and relationships 
there are limited cases within all of our business segments that we are considered by our clients to be the sole source provider  based principally upon the experience of our personnel or  in the case of bode and certain dna investigations  our technical expertise 
our clients consist of government entities  corporations and high net worth and high profile individuals 
we provide our services domestically through our own employees and through a network of approved subcontractors to achieve scale  geographic coverage or a specialized expertise 
currently  a small portion of our revenues is generated by services provided outside the united states 
gross profit our gross profit represents our revenues less the costs of revenues incurred to provide services to our clients 
the most significant components of our costs of revenues are the costs of our direct labor  our third party consultants and our reimbursable costs  which principally consist of travel expenses 
for the most part  our costs of revenues are variable and based upon the type of services performed or the amount of revenues generated 
where possible  we structure our personnel arrangements to compensate our employees and our consultants on the basis of work performed 
this enables us to maintain a variable cost structure and relatively consistent gross margins in our business segments from year to year 
the variability in our gross margins results primarily from changes in our client mix 
for our dna analysis business  we incur fixed costs for our equipment and dedicated personnel 
operating expenses our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and commissions  as well as travel and other expenses  incurred by our employees who are involved in selling and promoting our services 
the accrued earnout expenses related to the acquisition of jlwa are also reflected in our selling and marketing expenses

also included in general and administrative expenses are corporate support expenses such as legal and professional fees  investor relations  human resources  facilities  telecommunication support services  information technology  stock option expenses  salaries for members of our senior management team and impairment losses recognized on goodwill

furthermore  the contract renewal process  which coincided with a request by the state to bring in more contractors and locally hired personnel  took more time than expected to complete 
as a result  our revenues were adversely affected  as a portion of the revenues we expected to recognize in under this contract were delayed until fraud and siu services revenues were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or was primarily attributable to the expansion of our client base through the acquisitions of hyperion risk in august and facticon on february   including the addition of a significant new third party administrator client  through whom we generated  of investigation related revenue for the year ended december  security consulting and investigations revenues were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the december  the increase of  or was attributable to the client base that we acquired in connection with the acquisitions of safir in may for security consulting and investigations  on line consulting in january for fire and other building security  and bode at the end of february for data banking and dna investigations

the line of credit and all obligations outstanding thereunder are due and payable not later than march  we are currently in discussions with respect to the renewal or replacement of this line of credit 
we anticipate that any renewal or replacement would be in an aggregate amount sufficient for our current working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully renew or replace this line of credit 
on october   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  receiving approximately  in gross proceeds  in net proceeds

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are more fully described in our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and  as a result  they are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we have identified certain of our accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and which require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition and related costs for investigation  crisis management and non dna related security  revenue is recognized on a time and materials or fixed price arrangement and is recognized as the services are performed pursuant to the applicable contractual arrangements 
revenue related to time and materials arrangements is recognized in the period in which the services are performed

the impact of any revisions in estimated total revenue and direct contract costs is recognized in the period in which they become known 
expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue are billed to the client and recorded as revenue when incurred 
for dna related revenues  revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  prices are fixed or determinable  services and products are provided to the client  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company reduces revenue for estimated discounts and other allowances 
revenues earned on dna related services are derived from the following sources forensic dna analysis  research and development projects  and sales of dna collection products 
the company recognizes revenues from forensic dna analysis at the time tests are completed and the results are reported to the client 
revenues from research and development projects are recognized as the related research is completed and when the company has satisfied specific obligations under the terms of the respective agreements 
revenues from the sales of dna collection products are recognized upon delivery of the products to the client 
forensic dna analysis is billed on a per sample fixed fee arrangement 
research and development projects are billed on a cost plus fixed fee arrangement 
costs incurred in the performance of forensic dna analysis are recorded as inventories and charged to cost of revenues upon the completion of the project  which generally ranges from one to three months 
costs related to research and development projects are expensed as incurred and costs related to dna collection products are maintained as inventory and charged to operations when the products are delivered 
intangible assets  goodwill and impairment in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  we recognize certain intangible assets acquired in acquisitions  primarily goodwill  trade names  covenants not to compete and client relationships 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas on a regular basis  we perform impairment analysis of the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets by assessing the recoverability when there are indications of potential impairment based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   the company performed an evaluation of its goodwill 
the company performed its annual impairment tests of goodwill for three of its reporting segments preparedness services  fraud and siu services and security consulting investigations  as required under sfas as a result of these tests  the company determined that the amount of goodwill recorded in connection with the fraud and siu services segment was impaired or not fully recoverable  as the current performance and future expectations do not support the carrying value of goodwill 
as a result  the company recorded a  impairment charge during the year ended december  for the fraud and siu services segment 
at december   the company performed an evaluation of goodwill 
we performed our annual impairment tests of goodwill for our reporting segments preparedness services  fraud and siu services and security consulting and investigations  as required under sfas as a result of these tests  we determined that the remaining amount of goodwill recorded in connection with two of the three reporting segments was impaired or not fully recoverable  as the current performance and future expectations did not support the carrying value of goodwill for these reporting segments 
the impairment affects fraud and siu services and security consulting and investigations 
as a result  we recorded a  impairment charge for the year ended december  of which  is for fraud and siu services and  is for security consulting and investigations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the number of clients that comprise our client base  along with the different industries  governmental entities and geographic regions  including foreign countries  in which our clients operate  limits concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable 
we do not generally require collateral or other security to support client receivables  although we do require retainers  up front deposits or irrevocable letters of credit in certain situations 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon facts surrounding the credit risk of specific clients and past collections history 
credit losses have been within management s expectations 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior years results 
under this transition method  employee stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  included compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted  but not yet fully vested  prior to january  the fair value of the options granted was determined at the original grant date in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the company recognizes these compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of the options associated with the underlying employment agreement  where applicable 
as a result of adopting sfas r  the impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  was to record an expense of approximately  greater than if the company had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb and is reflected within general and administrative expenses 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r on both basic and diluted net loss per share for the year ended december  was per share 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf which require that such equity instruments be recorded at their fair value on the measurement date  which is typically the date the services are performed 
stock based compensation for non employees is accounted for under eitf and is reflected within general and administrative expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas 
sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measurement of fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the financial accounting standards board fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
we applied the provisions of the fasb staff position fsp on fasb no 
 effective date of fasb statement fsp fas which defers the provisions of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to the first fiscal period beginning after november  the deferred nonfinancial assets and liabilities include items such as goodwill 
we are required to adopt sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal and we believe that the adoption of sfas will not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fair value option established by this statement permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
adoption is required for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
the company did not elect the fair value reporting option for any assets and liabilities not previously recorded at fair value 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase 
sfas r is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we expect sfas r to have an impact on the accounting for any future business acquisitions as of the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas requires a the ownership interest in the subsidiary held by parties other than the parent to be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity  but separate from the parent s equity  b the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and c changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary to be accounted for consistently 
entities must provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we expect sfas to have an impact on the accounting for any future business acquisitions as of the effective date 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flow 
the guidance in sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
this statement encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we are evaluating the implications of sfas and its impact on the financial statements has not yet been determined 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
the guidance of fsp is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r when the underlying arrangement includes renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon renewal or extension 
companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension as adjusted for sfas s entity specific factors 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we expect that the impact of the adoption of fsp will not be material 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap for nongovernmental entities 
sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities eitf 
eitf clarified that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders 
awards of this nature are considered participating securities and the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share must be applied 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in november  the eitf issued eitf no 
 equity method investment accounting considerations eitf 
this issue addresses the impact that sfas r and sfas might have on the accounting for equity method investments  including how the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be determined  how it should be tested for impairment  and how changes in classification from equity method to cost method should be treated 
this issue is effective on a prospective basis in fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  consistent with the effective dates of sfas r and sfas the company does not anticipate that eitf no 
will have a significant impact on the reporting of our results of operations
