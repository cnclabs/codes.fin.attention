critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions are made by management to assess the overall likelihood that an accounting estimate or assumption may require adjustment 
management assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past  and future estimates or assumptions are likely to be calculated on the same basis 
stock based compensation the company follows the provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
the fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
for the performance based options granted in and the service based options granted during  the company took into consideration guidance under sfas r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab when reviewing and updating assumptions 
the expected option life is derived from assumed exercise rates based upon historical exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of our shares using weekly price observations over an observation period of three years 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve rate in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected option life 
due to the company s history with respect to incentive stock options  the estimated forfeiture rate included in the option valuation was zero 
revenue recognition revenue from product shipments  including shipping and handling fees  is recognized once delivery has occurred provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
sales to international distributors are recognized in the same manner 
if title does not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  then revenue recognition is deferred until that time 
there are no formal sales incentives offered to any of the company s customers 
volume discounts may be offered from time to time to customers purchasing large quantities on a per transaction basis 
there are no special post shipment obligations or acceptance provisions that exist with any sales arrangements 
inventory raw material inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
finished goods and work in process are valued at average cost of production  which includes material  labor and manufacturing expenses 
comprehensive income loss foreign currency assets and liabilities of the company s foreign subsidiaries are translated at period end exchange rates  while income and expenses are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the statement of shareholders equity in accordance with sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a key consideration in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts has been  and will continue to be  our customer s payment history and aging of its accounts receivable balance 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if the ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
we must continue to be profitable in order to be able to utilize this asset in future periods 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is ongoing  subjective and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows and forecasts 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over fair value of net assets acquired 
testing for the impairment of goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires the comparing of a reporting units fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by estimating the fair values of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that unit s goodwill 
goodwill is attributable to two of the company s reporting unit s  willtek communications gmbh and microlab fxr 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers various valuation methods to evaluate recoverability  such as discounted cash flows  comparable companies and comparable transactions 
when such an impairment exists  the related assets are reduced to their net realizable value 
results of operations year ended december  compared to net sales for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of weakened demand for the company s products and services  particularly in the latter part of the company s gross profit on net sales for the year ended december  was  or as compared to  or as reported in the previous year 
gross profit margins are lower in than in primarily due to a decrease in sales contribution from willtek  whose products generally contribute higher gross profit margins within the company s product mix  and the result of decreased volume along with product discounts offered to our customers 
the combination of lower revenue volume and pricing pressure in  coupled with fixed manufacturing labor costs  contributed to the company s lower gross margins 
the company can experience variations in gross profit based upon the mix of product sales as well as variations due to revenue volume and economies of scale 
the company continues to rigidly monitor costs associated with material acquisition  manufacturing and production 
operating expenses for the year ended december   excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  were  or of net sales as compared to  or of net sales for the year ended december  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  operating expenses decreased by  operating expenses are lower in due to a reduction in headcount and decreased spending in both research and development and sales and marketing  partially off set by an increase in general and administrative expense

in light of the current market challenges facing willtek  including significant technology research and development expenses required to remain competitive  management is currently evaluating several strategic alternatives and opportunities 
these include  among others  a significant restructuring of the existing business  finding a strategic partner  making additional investments in technology research and development or a sale of some or all of the willtek assets 
interest income decreased by  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a lower cash investment balance and consequently decreased returns on short term investments in other income decreased by  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the recording of realized losses from the sale of investment securities in and  in  the inclusion of a realized gain on foreign currency exchange booked on the company s germany based subsidiary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s bank loan and the associated interest expense are not sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates 
the company s note was interest free through june and began bearing interest at the annual rate of beginning july the note requires twelve half yearly payments beginning december until maturity at june as a result  the company is not subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and will not be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate and the company is in a borrowing mode 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has one foreign subsidiary in germany 
the company does business in more than seventy countries and currently generates approximately of its revenues from outside of the americas 
the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets may be affected by changes in economic  political or market conditions in the foreign markets in which the company does business 
the company s total assets in its foreign subsidiary was million at december   translated into us dollars at the closing exchange rates 
the company also acquires certain inventory from foreign suppliers and  as such  faces risk due to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these risks could have a material impact on the company s results in future periods 
the potential loss based on end of period balances and prevailing exchange rates resulting from a hypothetical strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies was not material in the period ended december  the company does not currently employ any currency derivative instruments  futures contracts or other currency hedging techniques to mitigate its risks in this regard 
industry risk the electronic test and measurement industry is cyclical which can cause significant fluctuations in sales  gross profit margins and profits  from year to year 
it is difficult to predict the timing of the changing cycles in the electronic test and measurement industry
