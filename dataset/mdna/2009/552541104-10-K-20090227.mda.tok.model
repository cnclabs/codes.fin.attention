table of contents the data management acquisition on february   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  scantron corporation  purchased all of the limited liability membership interests of data management i llc data management from ncs pearson  for million in cash after giving effect to working capital adjustments of million the data management acquisition 
data management designs  manufactures and services scannable data collection products  including printed forms  scanning equipment and related software  and provides survey consulting and tracking services  including medical device tracking  as well as field maintenance services to corporate and governmental clients 
the company financed the data management acquisition and related fees and expenses with cash on hand at harland clarke holdings 
the harland acquisition on may   the company consummated an agreement and plan of merger with harland  pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of the company merged with and into harland  with harland continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of clarke american the harland acquisition 
the cash consideration paid was per share  or a total of approximately  million  for the outstanding equity of harland 
subsequent to the completion of the harland acquisition  clarke american was renamed harland clarke holdings on may  to fund the purchase price in the harland acquisition  to refinance harland clarke holdings and harland s prior existing indebtedness  and to pay the fees and expenses for the harland acquisition and the related financings harland clarke holdings entered into a  million senior secured term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility  and harland clarke holdings issued million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes due the harland acquisition and related financing transactions have greatly increased the company s revenues  cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
as a result of the application of purchase accounting under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  the company s depreciation and amortization expense has also increased significantly 
having completed the harland acquisition  the company is focused on improving operating margins by reducing selling general and administrative expenses  shared services costs and cost of sales 
economic and other factors affecting the businesses of the company harland clarke while total non cash payments including checks  credit cards  debit cards and other electronic forms of payment are growing  the number of checks written has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
harland clarke believes the number of checks printed is driven by the number of checks written  the number of new checking accounts opened and reorders reflecting changes in consumers personal situations  such as name or address changes 
checks written remain one of the largest forms of non cash payment in the united states 
a study by the federal reserve analyzing check writing patterns determined that the number of checks written declined over the period from to whereas in the past  harland clarke had experienced declines in check volumes generally consistent with the federal reserve study  in recent periods harland clarke is experiencing check unit declines slightly higher than those reflected in the federal reserve study 
harland clarke is unable to determine at this time whether such slight declines above federal reserve estimates are attributable to timing issues  decreased openings of checking accounts  underlying differences in measurement methodologies  recent economic and financial market difficulties  and or a further acceleration in check unit declines 
harland clarke is focused on growing its business through the addition of a variety of 
table of contents non check related products and services and optimizing its existing catalog of offerings to better serve its customers 
the financial institution outsourcing services industry is highly competitive and fragmented with quality and breadth of service offerings and strength of customer relationships among the key competitive factors 
within this category  harland clarke competes with large outsourcing service providers that offer a wide variety of services including those that compete with harland clarke s primary offerings specifically payment services  marketing services  and teleservices 
there are also other competitors that specialize in providing one or more of these services 
the harland clarke segment s operating results are also affected by consumer confidence and employment 
consumer confidence directly correlates with consumer spending  while employment also affects revenues through the number of new checking accounts being opened 
the harland clarke segment s operating results may be negatively affected by slow or negative growth of  or downturns in  the united states economy 
business confidence affects a portion of the harland clarke segment 
in addition  if harland clarke s financial institution customers fail or merge with other financial institutions  harland clarke may lose any or all revenue from such financial institutions and or experience further pricing pressure  which would negatively affect harland clarke s operating results 
harland financial solutions harland financial solutions operating results are affected by the overall demand for our products  software and related services which is based upon the technology budgets of our clients and prospects 
economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which we do business could result in reductions in the information technology  or it  budgets for some portion of our clients and potentially longer lead times for acquiring harland financial solutions products and services 
in addition  if harland financial solutions financial institution customers fail or merge with other financial institutions  harland financial solutions may lose any or all revenue from such financial institutions and or experience further pricing pressure  which would negatively affect harland financial solutions operating results 
the markets for our harland financial solutions products are characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards  regulatory changes in client requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the markets for providing technological solutions to financial institutions and other enterprises requires that we continually improve our existing products and create new products while at the same time controlling our costs to remain price competitive 
the market for providing technological solutions to financial institutions is highly competitive and fragmented 
harland financial solutions competes with several domestic and international companies 
there are also other competitors that offer one or more specialized products or services that compete with harland financial solutions 
some of our competitors have advantages over harland financial solutions due to their significant worldwide presence  longer operating and product development history  larger installed client base  and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
in response to competition  harland financial solutions has been required in the past  and may be required in the future  to furnish additional discounts to clients  otherwise modify pricing practices or offer more favorable payment terms or more favorable contractual implementation terms 
scantron while the number of tests given annually in k and higher education markets continues to grow  the demand for optical mark reader paper based testing has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
changes in educational funding can affect the rate at which schools adopt new technology thus slowing the decline for paper based testing but also slowing the demand for scantron s on line testing products 
educational funding changes may also reduce the rate of consumption of scantron s forms and purchase of additional hardware to process these forms 
economic slowdown in the united states may negatively affect education budgets and spending  which would have an adverse impact on scantron s operating results 

table of contents data collection for non testing applications such as surveys is also experiencing a conversion to non paper based methods of collection 
scantron believes this trend will also continue as the availability of these alternative technologies becomes more widespread 
changes in the overall economy can impact the demand for surveys as companies look for ways to adjust their expenditures 
mafco worldwide developments and trends within the tobacco industry may have a material effect on the operations of mafco worldwide 
worldwide consumption of american blend cigarettes has declined approximately to per year for the past five years  however  this decline has accelerated recently to approximately 
changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  an increase in excise and other taxes on cigarettes and a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries have contributed significantly to this worldwide decline in consumption 
consumption of chewing tobacco and moist snuff is concentrated primarily in the united states 
domestic consumption of chewing tobacco products has declined by approximately per year over the past five years 
moist snuff consumption has increased approximately per year over the past five years due at least in part to the shift away from cigarettes and other types of smoking and smokeless tobacco 
producers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the united states at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
the united states senate and house of representatives each have pending legislation that would provide greater regulatory oversight for the manufacture of tobacco products including proposals that could grant government agencies the ability to regulate tobacco product additives 
such legislation  if enacted  could potentially limit the type or quantity of additives that may be used in the manufacture of tobacco products in the united states together with changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  a constant expansion of tobacco regulations worldwide has been a major cause for the decline in consumption 
moreover  the trend is toward increasing regulation of the tobacco industry 
restrictive foreign tobacco legislation has been on the rise in recent years as well  including restrictions on where tobacco may be sold and used  warning labels and other graphic packaging images  product constituent limitations and a general increase in taxes 
over the years  there has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals  various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products 
in part  as a result of settlements in certain of this litigation  the cigarette companies have significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup the cost of the settlements 
since  cigarette consumption in the united states has decreased due to the higher prices of cigarettes  the increased emphasis on the health effects of cigarettes and the continuing restrictions on smoking areas 
the tobacco industry  including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  has been subject to federal  state  local and foreign excise taxes for many years 
in recent years  federal  state  local and foreign governments have increased or proposed increases to such taxes as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of tobacco products 
in february  the federal state children s health insurance program schip was enacted 
the additional taxes imposed by schip may lead to an accelerated decline in tobacco products sold in the united states 
this bill is being funded by raising the federal tax on cigarettes to per pack from the current per pack tax and by significantly increasing federal taxes on cigars and other tobacco products 
other proposals to increase taxes on tobacco products are also pending in both the united states and in foreign countries 
a significant reduction in consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company reviews its accounting policies on a regular basis 
the company makes estimates and judgments as part of its financial reporting that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  pensions 
table of contents and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  as well as other assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from the assumed outcomes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition the company considers its revenue recognition policy as critical to its reported results of operations primarily in its harland financial solutions and scantron segments 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the application of these pronouncements requires judgment  including  amongst other things  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements  and whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers receive certain elements of the company s products and services over time 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in the company s ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements 
for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software  the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
the company s software license agreements include multiple products and services or elements 
none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 
sop  as amended by sop  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated proportionally to each element based on vsoe of fair value 
fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately 
in the event that the company determines that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement  but does exist for all of the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method allowed by sop under the residual method  a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 
implementation services are generally for installation  training  implementation and configuration 
these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software 
vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately 
generally revenue is recognized when services are completed 
on implementations for outsourced data processing services  revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the outsourcing arrangement 
on certain larger implementations  revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation 
milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on labor hours 
estimates of efforts to complete a project are used in the percentage of completion calculation 
due to uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from these estimates 
maintenance fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is usually twelve months 
vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 
outsourced data processing services and other transaction processing services are recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered 
the company recognizes product and service revenue when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  products have been shipped and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer and an economic exchange has taken place 
revenues are recorded net of any applicable discounts  contract 
table of contents acquisition payments amortization  accrued incentives and allowances for sales returns 
deferred revenues represent amounts billed to the customer in excess of amounts earned 
title for product sales may pass to customers upon leaving the company s facilities  upon receipt at a specific destination such as a shipping port or upon arrival at the customer s facilities  depending on the terms of the contractual agreements for each customer 
title for product sales to domestic customers typically passes when the product leaves the company s facilities 
title for product sales to international customers typically passes either when the product is delivered to a shipping port or when the product is delivered to the customer s facilities 
revenues for direct response marketing services are recognized from the company s fixed price direct mail and marketing contracts based on the proportional performance method for specific projects 
inventories the majority of the company s inventories consists of licorice raw materials 
licorice raw materials have an indefinite life as long as they are kept dry  therefore the company has not been required to establish an obsolescence reserve for licorice 
a reserve for the value of the products has not been necessary based on the company s lower of cost or market analysis 
the company determines cost by average costing or the first in  first out method 
the company also ensures that storage facilities where the raw materials are inventoried are properly safeguarded and maintained to preserve its characteristics 
income taxes the company estimates its actual current tax liability together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating losses and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will recover deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate the amount of income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
on a regular basis  the amount of taxable income is reviewed by various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  the company routinely provides reserves for items that it believes could be challenged by these taxing authorities 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of these assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  it measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
significant assumptions requiring judgment are required to determine future cash flows  including but not limited to the estimated remaining useful life of the asset  future revenue streams and future expenditures to maintain the existing service potential of the asset 
the company re evaluates the useful life of these assets at least annually to determine if events and 
table of contents circumstances continue to support their recorded useful lives 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less estimated costs to sell such assets 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
acquired intangibles are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired 
goodwill and other intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the company has six reporting units  which are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
certain of the company s reporting units are the same as its reportable segments and certain reporting units are one level below the reportable segment  which is at the operating segment level 
the company utilizes both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows 
the discount rate used is the value weighted average of the company s estimated cost of equity and debt cost of capital derived using  both known and estimated  customary market metrics 
the company s weighted average cost of capital is adjusted by reporting unit to reflect a risk factor  if necessary  for each reporting unit 
the company performs sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach 
in applying the market approach  valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies  evaluated and adjusted  if necessary  based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies  and applied to the appropriate historical and or projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value 
the company weights the results of the income and market approaches equally 
the results of the company s tests indicated no impairment as the estimated fair values were greater than the carrying values 
the company assesses the results of the reporting unit valuations in relation to the value indicated by the company s market capitalization to ensure that the results are reasonable relative to market pricing 
during the latter part of the fourth quarter of and continuing into  the company s market capitalization was below book value 
the company considered the market capitalization decline and determined it did not impact the overall goodwill impairment analysis as management believes the decline to be primarily attributed to the negative market conditions as a result of the credit crisis and the economic recession  rather than a significant decline in the fair value of the company or any of its reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the company s implied fair value requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value 
the company measures impairment of its indefinite lived tradenames and trademarks based on the relief from royalty method 
under the relief from royalty method of the income approach  the value of an intangible asset is determined by quantifying the cost savings a company enjoys by owning  as opposed to licensing  the intangible asset 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar tradenames and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 
the company also re evaluates the useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the company measures impairment of mafco worldwide s indefinite lived product formulations based on the excess earnings method of the income approach 
under this methodology  the estimated fair value of the product formulations is determined by the sum of the present values of the projected annual earnings attributable to the product formulations 
the company also re evaluates the useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 

table of contents the annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets involve significant estimates made by management 
the discounted cash flow analyses require various judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates 
assumptions about sales  operating margins and growth rates are based on the company s budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
changes in estimates could have a material impact in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods 
intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are evaluated for impairment as discussed above in long lived assets 
contingencies and indemnification agreements the company records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are contingencies  and the accounting for such events follows sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment by management 
the company uses internal expertise and consults with outside experts  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that the company has incurred a loss and the amount or range of the loss 
when evaluating the need for an accrual or a change in an existing accrual  the company considers whether it is reasonably probable to estimate an outcome for the contingency based on its experience  any experience of others facing similar contingencies of which the company is aware and the particulars of the circumstances creating the contingency 
see item legal proceedings  and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans  which cover certain current and former company employees who meet eligibility requirements 
also  as a result of the harland acquisition  the company sponsors unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans that cover certain salaried and nonsalaried former harland employees 
one postretirement benefit plan provides health care benefits and the other provides life insurance benefits 
the company consults with outside actuaries who use several statistical and other factors that attempt to estimate future events to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on pension plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates and the expected health care cost trend rate to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  higher or lower healthcare inflation rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant difference with the amount of pension and postretirement benefit income expense and asset liability that the company recorded 
derivative financial instruments the company began using derivative financial instruments in to manage interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
the company recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met  the company recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in other comprehensive income loss until the underlying debt instrument being hedged is settled or the company determines that the specific hedge accounting criteria are no longer met 
on the date the interest rate derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
the company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
the company links all hedges that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments 
the company links all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions or to liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company also assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
table of contents flows of hedged items 
if an existing derivative were to become not highly effective as a hedge  the company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge based on total changes in the hedge s cash flows at each payment date as compared to the change in the expected future cash flows on the long term debt 
investments the company has investments classified as available for sale securities  consisting of auction rate debt securities ars backed by student loans  united states corporate securities and other equity interests which are stated at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements  with unrealized gains and losses on such investments reflected  net of tax  as other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on investments are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
the fair value of the ars is estimated utilizing discounted cash flow analyses 
the analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the securities  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  as well as forecasted probabilities of default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or repurchase at par for each period 
there is inherent subjectivity involved in estimating future cash flows and changes in estimates could have a material impact in the carrying amount of ars in future periods 
if the market value of an investment declines below its cost  the company evaluates whether the decline is temporary  or other than temporary 
the company considers several factors in determining whether a decline is temporary including the length of time market value has been below cost  the magnitude of the decline  financial prospects of the issuer or business and the company s intention to hold the security 
if a decline in market value of an investment is determined to be other than temporary  a charge to earnings is recorded for the loss and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements it has not been the company s practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
there has historically been no material losses related to such indemnifications  and the company does not expect any material adverse claims in the future 
the company is not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entity or other third party that is reasonably likely to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in addition  the company has not established any special purpose entity 
consolidated operating results subsequent to the completion of the harland acquisition on may   the company reorganized its business along four reportable segments together with a corporate group for certain support services 
the reorganization aligns the company s operations on the basis of products  services and industry 
the licorice products segment includes mafco worldwide operations 
the company s previously existing financial institution and direct to consumer segments were combined with harland s similar operations  this business segment now operates under the name of harland clarke and is referred to as the harland clarke segment 
the company also added two new reportable segments for business lines acquired in the harland acquisition 
table of contents the harland financial solutions segment and the scantron segment 
during the first quarter of  the company transferred its field maintenance services from the harland financial solutions segment to the scantron segment

the company s ars investments are collateralized by student loan portfolios substantially all of which are guaranteed by the united states government 
the ars are securities with long term maturities for which the interest rates reset every or days by an auction process 
historically  these types of ars investments have been highly liquid 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand at auction for ars investments collateralized by student loans  including auctions for ars investments held by the company 
as a result  these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
in the event the company needs to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  it will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until either a future auction for these investments is successful  they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the company does not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
the fair value of these securities as of december  was estimated utilizing discounted cash flow analyses 
the analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the securities  the credit worthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  as well as forecasted probabilities of default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or repurchase at par for each period 
as a result of the temporary declines in fair value for the company s ars  which the company attributes to liquidity issues rather than credit issues  it has recorded an unrealized loss of million  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the year ended december  because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near term  as of december  the ars are classified as long term investments

during the years ended december   and  harland clarke holdings made million  million and million of payments for restructuring  respectively 
periods prior to may   the date of the harland acquisition  do not include payments related to the acquired harland operations 
harland clarke holdings anticipates that its future capital expenditures and contract acquisition payments will be largely consistent with the combined historical levels of such payments for clarke american  harland and data management

mafco worldwide in addition to mafco worldwide s normal operating cash and working capital requirements and service of its indebtedness  it also requires cash to fund capital expenditures  periodically build raw materials inventories and fund administrative and other expenses regarding indemnified liabilities 

table of contents capital expenditures 
during the years ended december    and  mafco worldwide incurred million  million  and million of capital expenditures  respectively 
while expenditures for future years are expected to be within this general range  future changes in governmental regulations could require the company to substantially increase capital expenditures in order to comply with these regulations 
inventories 
mafco worldwide s licorice raw materials are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
additionally  most of the licorice root mafco worldwide purchases originates in countries and regions that have  from time to time  been subject to political instability 
accordingly  mafco worldwide must periodically build its raw materials supply in order to avoid material shortages or significant raw material price increases 
shortages of licorice raw materials could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
mafco worldwide believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including borrowings under its revolving credit facility  will be adequate to make required payments on its indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and to satisfy its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flow risks each of harland clarke holdings and mafco worldwide s ability to meet their respective debt service obligations and reduce their total debt will depend upon their respective ability to generate cash in the future which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond each s respective control 
each of harland clarke holdings and mafco worldwide may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to them under their credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable them to repay their debt or to fund their other liquidity needs 
as of december   harland clarke holdings had million of additional availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to the issuance of million of letters of credit and mafco worldwide had million of additional availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to the issuance of million of letters of credit 
the company may also use the revolving credit facilities to fund potential future acquisitions 
if future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay each s respective obligations as they mature or to fund their liquidity needs  harland clarke holdings or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may be forced to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of their debt on or before maturity 
harland clarke holdings or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of their existing and future indebtedness may limit their ability to pursue any of these alternatives 
mafco worldwide may encounter liquidity risks arising from its supply of licorice root raw material 
mafco worldwide tries to maintain a sufficient licorice root raw material inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for two to three years 
at december   mafco worldwide had on hand a supply of licorice root raw material between two and three years 
licorice root has an indefinite retention period as long as it is kept dry  and therefore has experienced little  if any  material spoilage 
although mafco worldwide has been able to obtain licorice root raw materials without interruption since world war ii  since there has been periodic instability in the areas of the world where licorice root raw materials are obtained  mafco worldwide may in the future experience a short supply of licorice root raw materials due to these or other instabilities 
if mafco worldwide is unable to obtain licorice root raw materials  or is unable to obtain them in a cost effective manner  mafco worldwide s business will be severely hampered and mafco worldwide will experience severe liquidity difficulties 
in  mafco worldwide s ten largest customers  six of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net revenues and approximately of mafco worldwide s net revenues 
if any of mafco worldwide s significant customers were to stop purchasing 
table of contents licorice from mafco worldwide  it would have a material adverse effect on the financial results of mafco worldwide  which would also create severe liquidity difficulties for mafco worldwide 
non operating contingent claims  indemnification and insurance matters the company s non operating contingent claims are generally associated with its indirect  wholly owned  non operating subsidiary  pneumo abex llc together with its predecessors in interest  pneumo abex 
substantially all of these contingent claims are the financial responsibility of third parties and include various environmental and asbestos related claims 
as a result  the company has not since paid and does not expect to pay on its own behalf material amounts related to these matters 
in  a predecessor of pepsiamericas  inc the original indemnitor sold to pneumo abex various operating businesses  all of which pneumo abex re sold by prior to the sale  those businesses had manufactured certain asbestos containing friction products 
pneumo abex has been named  typically along with to as many as or more other companies  as a defendant in various personal injury lawsuits claiming damages relating to exposure to asbestos 
pursuant to indemnification agreements  the original indemnitor has ultimate responsibility for all the remaining asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex through august and for certain asbestos related claims asserted thereafter 
in connection with the sale by pneumo abex in december of its friction products division  a subsidiary the friction buyer of cooper industries  inc now cooper industries  llc  the friction guarantor assumed all liability for substantially all asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex after august and not indemnified by the original indemnitor 
following the friction products sale  pneumo abex treated the division as a discontinued operation and stopped including the division s assets and liabilities in its financial statements 
in  mcg intermediate holdings inc mcgi  m f worldwide and two subsidiaries of m f worldwide entered into a transfer agreement the transfer agreement 
under the transfer agreement  pneumo abex transferred to mcgi substantially all of its assets and liabilities other than the assets and liabilities relating to its former abex nwl aerospace division aerospace and certain contingent liabilities and the related assets  including its historical insurance and indemnification arrangements 
the transfer agreement provides for appropriate transfer  indemnification and tax sharing arrangements  in a manner consistent with applicable law and previously existing contractual arrangements  as further explained below 
the transfer agreement also requires mcgi  which currently is an indirect subsidiary of holdings  to undertake certain administrative and funding obligations with respect to certain categories of asbestos related claims and other liabilities  including environmental claims  that pneumo abex did not transfer 
pneumo abex will be obligated to reimburse the amounts so funded only when it receives amounts under related indemnification and insurance agreements 
such administrative and funding obligations would be terminated as to these categories of asbestos related claims in the case of a bankruptcy of pneumo abex or m f worldwide or of certain other events affecting the availability of coverage for such claims from third party indemnitors and insurers 
in the event of certain kinds of disputes with pneumo abex s indemnitors regarding their indemnities  the transfer agreement permits pneumo abex to require mcgi to fund of the costs of resolving the disputes 
pneumo abex s former subsidiary maintained product liability insurance covering substantially all of the period during which it manufactured or distributed asbestos containing products 
the subsidiary commenced litigation in against a portion of these insurers in order to confirm the availability of this coverage 
as a result of settlements in that litigation  other coverage agreements with other carriers  payments by the original indemnitor and funding payments pursuant to the transfer agreement  all of pneumo abex s monthly expenditures for asbestos related claims other than as described below are managed and paid by others 
as of december   the company has not incurred and does not expect to incur material amounts related to asbestos related claims not subject to the arrangements described above the remaining claims 
management does not expect the remaining claims to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but the company is unable to forecast either the number of future asbestos related claimants or the amount of future defense and settlement costs associated with present or future asbestos related claims 

table of contents the transfer agreement further provides that mcgi will assume from pneumo abex all liability for environmental matters associated with pneumo abex s and its predecessor s operations to the extent not paid by third party indemnitors or insurers  other than matters relating to pneumo abex s former aerospace business 
accordingly  environmental liabilities arising after the transaction with the original indemnitor that relate to the former aerospace business are the company s responsibility 
the original indemnitor is obligated to indemnify pneumo abex for costs  expenses and liabilities relating to environmental and natural resource matters to the extent attributable to the pre operation of the businesses acquired from the original indemnitor  subject to certain conditions and limitations principally relating to compliance with notice  cooperation and other procedural requirements 
the original indemnitor is generally discharging its environmental indemnification liabilities in the ordinary course  and mcgi manages and advances all costs associated with such matters pending reimbursement by the original indemnitor 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any of the sites subject to the indemnity from the original indemnitor due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by pneumo abex 
however  the company does not itself expect to pay any of these costs due to the transfer agreement and the original indemnitor s indemnity 
the company considers pneumo abex s unassumed contingent claims  except for certain immaterial matters where no third party indemnification or assumption arrangement exists  to be the financial responsibility of those third parties and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their abilities to satisfy their obligations 
based upon these third parties repeated acknowledgements of their obligations  active management of these contingent claims  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of these third parties failing to satisfy these claims against pneumo abex is remote 
federal mogul corporation purchased the friction buyer in october in october  the friction buyer filed a petition under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and stopped performing its obligations to pneumo abex 
the friction guarantor guaranteed performance of the friction buyer s obligations  however  and  since the friction buyer s bankruptcy filing  has been fulfilling the friction buyer s obligations 
as a result of further developments in the friction buyer s bankruptcy case  in october  pneumo abex received million plus interest earned since december  and the friction guarantor received million plus interest in full satisfaction of the claims of pneumo abex and the friction guarantor in the friction buyer s bankruptcy case 
resolution of these claims did not affect the friction guarantor s guaranty in favor of pneumo abex 
the former aerospace business of the company formerly sold certain of its aerospace products to the united states government or to private contractors for the united states government 
the company retained in the aerospace sale certain claims for allegedly defective pricing that the government made with respect to certain of these products 
in the sole remaining matter  the company contests the government s allegations and has been attempting to resolve this matter without litigation 
honeywell indemnification certain of the intermediate holding companies of the predecessor of harland clarke holdings had issued guarantees on behalf of operating companies formerly owned by these intermediate holding companies  which operating companies are not part of harland clarke holdings businesses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
at december   harland clarke holdings had  million of term loans outstanding under its credit agreement  million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility  million of floating rate senior notes and million of fixed rate senior notes 
at december   mafco worldwide had million of term loans outstanding under its credit agreement and million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
at december   m f worldwide had million of short term debt outstanding 
all of these outstanding loans bear interest at variable rates  with the exception of the million of fixed rate senior notes 
accordingly  the company is subject to risk due to changes in interest rates 
the company believes that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to its floating rate debt outstanding at december  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in its annual interest expense of approximately million  excluding the impact of the interest rate derivative transactions discussed below 
in order to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on a portion of the outstanding variable rate debt  the company entered into interest rate derivative transactions in and in the form of swaps for harland clarke holdings with notional amounts totaling million and a collar for mafco worldwide with a notional amount of million  as further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

mafco worldwide s french subsidiary sells in several foreign currencies as well as the united states dollar and purchases raw materials principally in united states dollars 
mafco worldwide s chinese subsidiaries primarily sell finished products and purchase raw materials in united states dollars 
since the exposures are not material on these transactions  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase in the related assets or liabilities 
conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease in the related assets or liabilities 
the company s investments included million of auction rate securities ars held by m f worldwide as of december  these investments are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
the company s ars investments are collateralized by student loan portfolios substantially all of which are guaranteed by the united states government 
the ars held by the company are securities with long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates reset every or days by an auction process 
historically  these types of ars investments have been highly liquid 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand at auction for ars investments collateralized by student loans  including auctions for ars investments held by the company 
as a result  these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
the company believes that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing its ars investments has not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these ars investments 
in the event the company needs to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  it will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until either a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the company does not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
the fair value of these securities as of december  was estimated utilizing discounted cash flow analyses 
the analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the securities  the credit worthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  as well as forecasted probabilities of default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or repurchase at par for each period 
as a result of the temporary declines in fair value for the company s ars  which the company attributes to liquidity issues rather than credit issues  it has recorded an unrealized loss of million  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the year ended december  because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near term  as of december  the ars are classified as long term investments
