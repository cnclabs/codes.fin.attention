item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
company overview krispy kreme is a leading branded retailer and wholesaler of high quality doughnuts and packaged sweets 
the company s principal business  which began in  is owning and franchising krispy kreme stores at which over varieties of high quality doughnuts  including the company s original glazed doughnut  are made  sold and distributed together with complementary products  and where a broad array of coffees and other beverages are offered 
the company s stores include factory stores and satellite stores 
factory stores have a doughnut making production line and are versatile in that many supply multiple sales channels to more fully utilize production capacity 
these sales channels are comprised of on premises sales 
sales to customers visiting company and franchise factory and satellite stores  including sales made through drive through windows  along with discounted sales to community organizations that in turn sell doughnuts for fundraising purposes 
off premises sales 
sales of fresh doughnuts and packaged sweets primarily on a branded basis to a variety of retail customers  such as convenience stores  grocery stores mass merchants and other food service and institutional accounts 
doughnuts are sold to these customers on trays for display and sale in glass enclosed cases and in packages for display and sale on both stand alone display units and on customers shelves 
traditional factory stores have the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
commissaries  which are production facilities used principally to serve off premises customers domestically and to supplement factory stores focused on on premises sales internationally  have the highest production capacities of factory stores 
as of february   there were commissaries systemwide  six of which were operated by the company 
traditional factory stores often engage in both on premises and off premises sales  with the allocation between such channels dependent on the particular capacity of the store and the characteristics of the markets in which the stores operate 
other factory stores  including small factory stores which have less production capacity than relatively larger traditional factory stores  serve only the on premises distribution channel 
each factory store has significant fixed or semi fixed costs  and margins and profitability are significantly affected by doughnut production volume and sales 
as of february   there were krispy kreme factory stores systemwide  consisting of company stores and franchise stores 
satellite stores  all of which serve only the on premises distribution channel  consist primarily of the hot shop  fresh shop and kiosk formats 
the company has begun introducing hot shops  which utilize tunnel oven doughnut heating and finishing equipment scaled to accommodate principally on premises sales 
hot shop equipment allows customers to have a hot doughnut experience throughout the day 
fresh shops and free standing kiosks are satellite stores that do not contain doughnut heating equipment 
each of these three small shop formats is substantially smaller than a traditional factory store 
in each of these three formats  the company typically sells fresh doughnuts and beverages  with the doughnuts supplied by nearby factory stores 
as of february   hot shops  fresh shops and kiosks were open systemwide  the company operated of the hot shops 
the company views the hot shop  fresh shop and kiosk formats as additional ways to achieve market penetration in a variety of market sizes and settings 
the company is working to refine its domestic store operating model to focus on small retail concept shops  including both satellite shops and shops that manufacture doughnuts but which are smaller and have lower capacity than traditional factory stores 
satellite stores in a market are provided doughnuts from a single traditional factory store or commissary at which all doughnut production for the market takes place 
the objectives of the small retail concept model are to  among other things reduce the investment required to produce a given level of sales and reduce operating costs by operating smaller satellite stores instead of larger  more expensive factory stores  achieve greater production efficiencies by centralizing doughnut production to minimize the burden of fixed costs  achieve greater consistency of product quality through a reduction in the number of doughnut making locations  enable store employees to focus on achieving excellence in customer satisfaction and in shop consumer experience  and stimulate an increase in on premises sales of doughnuts and complementary products by increasing the number of retail distribution points to provide customers more convenient access to the company s products 
the company currently plans to open a modest number of new company operated satellite stores in fiscal  and domestic franchisees also may open additional satellite stores 
however  the company does not expect that it or its franchisees will open a significant number of domestic factory stores in the near future 
the company also plans to extend its testing of soft serve dairy products into additional locations in fiscal the company intends to finance these capital expenditures using existing cash balances and internally generated funds 
accordingly  completion of these capital projects is dependent upon the sufficiency of such funds to meet the company s capital expenditure needs  after providing for the company s other cash requirements  including debt service 
the company has converted six of its traditional factory stores to hot shops using tunnel oven equipment to reduce operating costs and increase the number of hours each day the stores offer the company s hot original glazed doughnuts 
certain franchisees also have converted a few factory stores to hot shops 
in addition  the company plans to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeastern united states 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
in fiscal  the company refranchised one idled store acquired by the company from a failed franchisee  refranchised two domestic operating stores to a new franchisee  and refranchised the four company stores in canada to a new franchisee 
the company received no proceeds in connection with any of these refranchising transactions 
like other retail and restaurant companies  the company constantly evaluates the performance of its stores and from time to time decides to close locations whose performance no longer meets company standards 
markets outside the united states are a source of growth 
as of february   there were a total of krispy kreme stores including satellites operated internationally  which were located in australia  bahrain  canada  indonesia  japan  kuwait  lebanon  mexico  the philippines  puerto rico  qatar  saudi arabia  south korea  the united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
in fiscal  new international stores were opened  and international stores were closed 
based on continued research and experience with international stores  the company is focusing international development efforts primarily on opportunities in markets in asia and the middle east 
existing development and franchise agreements for territories outside the united states which include the countries listed above provide for the development of over additional stores in fiscal and thereafter 
the company has equity interests in the franchisees operating stores in mexico and western canada 
the company currently does not expect to own equity interests in international area developers formed in the future 
the company is vertically integrated to help maintain the consistency and quality of products throughout the krispy kreme system 
in addition  through vertical integration  the company utilizes volume buying power  which the company believes helps lower the cost of supplies to stores and enhances profitability 
the supply chain business unit  kk supply chain  produces doughnut mixes and manufactures doughnut making equipment  which all factory stores are required to purchase 
the company manufactures doughnut mix at its facility in winston salem  north carolina 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with an independent food company to manufacture certain doughnut mixes for regions outside the southeastern united states and to provide doughnut mix production in the event of a disruption of business at the winston salem facility 
additionally  kk supply chain operates a distribution center which supplies domestic stores in the eastern united states and certain international franchise stores with key supplies 
in may  the company subcontracted with an independent distributor to supply the domestic stores not supplied from the winston salem distribution facility  which generally consist of stores west of the mississippi river 
these stores were previously supplied from a distribution center in southern california that closed in august the supply chain business unit is volume driven  and its economics are enhanced by the opening of new stores and the growth of sales by existing stores 
the company has three reportable segments as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  as described below 
company stores 
the company stores segment is comprised of the operating activities of the stores operated by the company 
these stores sell doughnuts and complementary products through the sales channels described above under company overview 
expenses for this business segment include store level expenses along with direct general and administrative expenses and certain allocated corporate costs 
franchise 
the franchise segment consists of the company s store franchise operations 
the company has two principal franchise programs the associate program  which is the company s original franchising program developed in the s  and the area developer program  which was developed in the mid s 
associates generally pay royalties of of on premises sales and of all other sales 
the franchise agreements with area developers typically provide for the payment of royalties of to of all sales and one time development and franchise fees ranging from  to  per store 
for fiscal  the company elected to reduce the royalty rate payable by domestic area developers on off premises sales from to  and the company has informed its domestic area developers that it will reduce the royalty rate on off premises sales to in fiscal expenses for this business segment include costs incurred to recruit new franchisees  to assist with store openings  to assist in the development of marketing and promotional programs  and to monitor and aid in the performance of these stores  as well as direct general and administrative expenses and certain allocated corporate costs 
kk supply chain 
the kk supply chain segment buys and processes ingredients it uses to produce doughnut mixes and manufactures doughnut making equipment that all factory stores are required to purchase 
the kk supply chain segment also purchases and sells key supplies  including icings and fillings  other food ingredients  juices  signage  display cases  uniforms and other items to both company and franchisee owned stores 
all intersegment sales from the kk supply chain segment to the company stores segment have been eliminated in consolidation 
expenses for this business unit include all expenses incurred at the manufacturing and distribution level along with direct general and administrative expenses and certain allocated corporate costs 
the ftc s trade regulation rule on franchising ftc rule and certain state and foreign laws require the company to furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise disclosure document containing information prescribed by the ftc rule and applicable state and foreign laws and regulations 
the company s franchise disclosure document complies with current ftc disclosure requirements  and the company has registered in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that require registration for the sale of franchises 
several franchisees have been experiencing financial pressures which  in certain instances  became exacerbated during fiscal and fiscal the company has guaranteed certain obligations of franchisees in which it has an equity interest  as described in other commitments and contingencies in note and note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
such guarantees totaled million as of february  and the aggregate recorded liability for estimated payments under such guarantees was million at that date 
subsequent to february   the company s aggregate franchisee loan and lease guarantee exposure was reduced to million 
during fiscal  two of the company s domestic franchisees filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
one of these bankruptcy cases was substantially concluded in february upon the sale of the franchisee s assets to  and assumption of most of its franchise agreements by  a successor franchisee 
the other franchise operation is continuing to operate under court supervision 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company s franchisee in hong kong commenced liquidation proceedings  and has since closed the nine stores it operated 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal royalty revenues and most of kk supply chain revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows

the table below presents average weekly sales per store which represents  on a company and systemwide basis  total sales of all stores divided by the number of operating weeks for both factory and satellite stores 
operating weeks represent  on a company and systemwide basis  the aggregate number of weeks in the fiscal year that both factory and satellite stores were in operation 
the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to january  which periodically results in a week year 
fiscal contained weeks 
to enhance comparability among the last three fiscal years  amounts in the table set forth below for fiscal have been computed based upon the week period ended january  fiscal year dollars in thousands average weekly sales per store company systemwide store operating weeks company    systemwide    excludes intrasystem sales between company and franchise stores 
fiscal compared to fiscal overview excluding sales for the rd week in fiscal  systemwide sales decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting a decrease in average weekly sales per store  partially offset by a increase in store operating weeks 
the systemwide sales decrease measured on a week basis reflects an decrease in company stores sales  partially offset by a increase in franchise store sales compared to the prior year 
the total number of factory stores at the end of the fiscal was  consisting of company stores and franchise stores 
satellite stores made up approximately of the total systemwide store count as of february   compared to approximately at february  systemwide average weekly sales per store are lower than company average weekly sales per store principally because satellite stores  which generally have lower average weekly sales than factory stores  have to date been operated almost exclusively by franchisees 
in addition  the increasing percentage of total stores which are satellite stores has the effect of reducing the overall systemwide average weekly sales per store

company stores revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week of fiscal  company stores revenues decreased in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues measured on a week basis reflects a decline in store operating weeks and a decrease in average weekly sales per store 
the decrease in store operating weeks reflects the refranchising or closure of company factory stores and three company satellite stores since the end of fiscal the company continuously reviews the performance of its stores and may decide to close additional locations  and the number of such closures may be significant 
on premises sales which include fundraising sales comprised approximately and of total company stores revenues in fiscal and  respectively  with the balance comprised of off premises sales 
the following table sets forth statistical data with respect to on and off premises sales by company stores 
all comparisons have been made excluding the rd week from fiscal the change in same store sales is computed by dividing the aggregate on premises sales including fundraising sales during the current year period for all stores which had been open for more than consecutive weeks during the current year but only to the extent such sales occurred in the th or later week of each store s operation by the aggregate on premises sales of such stores for the comparable weeks in the preceding year 
once a store has been open for at least consecutive weeks  its sales are included in the computation of same stores sales for all subsequent periods 
in the event a store is closed temporarily for example  for remodeling and has no sales during one or more weeks  such store s sales for the comparable weeks during the earlier or subsequent period are excluded from the same store sales computation 
for off premises sales  average weekly number of doors represents the average number of customer locations to which product deliveries are made during a week  and average weekly sales per door represents the average weekly sales to each such location

 on premises change in same store sales off premises change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door on premises same stores sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  generally reflecting a decrease in customer traffic partially offset by an increase in the average guest check 
the company is implementing programs designed to improve on premises sales  including increased focus on local store marketing efforts  improved employee training  store refurbishment efforts and the introduction of new products 
in the off premises distribution channel  the decrease in the average weekly number of doors represents a decrease in both the grocery mass merchant channel and in the convenience store channel 
the average weekly sales per door fell in both channels 
a decrease in average weekly sales per door generally adversely affects profitability because of the increased significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
however  the company is designing and implementing strategies to increase average per door sales and reduce costs in the off premises channel 
those strategies include improved route management and route consolidation including elimination of or reduction in the number of stops at relatively low volume doors  new sales incentives and performance based pay programs  and increased emphasis on relatively longer shelf life products 
the company increased on premises selling prices in late fiscal and increased off premises selling prices in early fiscal to partially offset rising costs  particularly increased costs of doughnut mixes and shortening due to rising agricultural commodity prices 
the company believes the selling price increases have adversely affected sales volumes  particularly in the off premises channel 
franchise revenues 
franchise revenues consist principally of royalties payable to the company by franchisees based upon the franchisees sales and initial franchise fees earned by the company in connection with new store openings by franchisees 
the components of franchise revenues are as follows year ended feb 
 feb 
 dollars in thousands royalties   development and franchise fees   other total franchise revenues   excluding the rd week of fiscal  franchise revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal royalty revenues measured on a week basis rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales by franchise stores  as reported by the franchisees  were approximately million in fiscal and million measured on a week basis in fiscal changes in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business reduced sales by international frachisees measured in us dollars by approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and for fiscal as a whole compared to the prior periods 
all of the growth in franchisee sales in fiscal was attributable to an increase in the number of franchise stores outside the united states 
domestic franchisee sales fell in fiscal compared to fiscal  principally due to store closings 
the company did not recognize as revenue approximately million and million of uncollected royalties which accrued during fiscal and  respectively  because the company did not believe collection of these royalties was reasonably assured 
the unrecorded revenue in fiscal relates principally to international franchisees  while the unrecorded revenue in fiscal related principally to domestic franchisees 
development and franchise fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to an increase in store openings by international franchisees 
development and franchise fees did not increase proportionately with the number of store openings principally because a greater percentage of fiscal openings were satellite stores compared to fiscal  development and franchise fees per store are lower for satellite stores than for factory stores 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
kk supply chain revenues 
kk supply chain revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week in fiscal  kk supply chain revenues decreased from million in fiscal the most significant reason for the decrease in revenues measured on a week basis was lower unit sales of mixes  ingredients and supplies resulting from lower sales by company and domestic franchise stores 
in addition  an increasing percentage of franchisee sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
many of the ingredients and supplies used by international franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
the decline in the kk supply chain revenue due to lower unit volume was partially offset by an increase in revenue resulting from price increases for mixes and certain other ingredients instituted by kk supply chain in fiscal in order to offset increases in materials costs 
the kk supply chain revenue decrease was also attributable to a decrease in sales of equipment and equipment services in fiscal compared to fiscal franchisee expansion in fiscal was comprised principally of satellite stores  which require less equipment than do factory stores 
sales of equipment and related services including signage  beverage equipment  furniture  fixtures and similar items sold through the kk supply chain distribution centers represented approximately and of kk supply chain revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal a significant majority of kk supply chain s revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses  which exclude depreciation and amortization expense  were of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal direct operating expenses by business segment expressed in dollars and as a percentage of applicable segment revenues are set forth in the table below

company stores direct operating expenses as a percentage of company stores revenues increased to for fiscal from in fiscal higher costs for materials resulting from price increases instituted by kk supply chain in fiscal in order to offset higher raw materials costs  higher fuel costs and the adverse effects on delivery efficiency of lower average weekly sales per door more than offset selling price increases and the benefit of closing underperforming stores 
recent economic conditions have led to significant reductions in the market prices of agricultural commodities and fuel which have resulted in price reductions by kk supply chain in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal the company is implementing programs intended to improve store operations and reduce costs as a percentage of revenues  including improved employee training and the introduction of improved food and labor cost management tools 
in addition  the company is implementing programs designed to improve the profitability of sales into the off premises distribution channel  where declines in the average weekly sales per door adversely affect profitability because of the increased significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
those strategies include improved route management and route consolidation including elimination of or reduction in the number of stops at relatively low volume doors  new sales incentives and performance based pay programs  and increased emphasis on relatively longer shelf life products 
franchise direct operating expenses 
franchise direct operating expenses include costs to recruit new franchisees  to assist in store openings  to support franchisee operations and marketing efforts  as well as direct general and administrative expenses and allocated corporate costs 
the increase in franchise direct operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a bad debt provision of approximately million principally related to credit exposure on international franchisees  partially offset by lower allocated corporate costs resulting from cost reduction efforts and lower store opening support expenses 
costs to support franchise store openings decline as individual franchisees gain experience opening stores and develop internal resources to assist in store openings 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses as a percentage of kk supply chain revenues before intersegment eliminations increased to in fiscal from in fiscal a significant component of the increase was a charge of approximately million approximately of kk supply chain revenues before intersegment eliminations related to the company s former third party freight consolidator 
for many years  the company utilized a third party freight consolidator to review and pay freight bills on behalf of the company 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company made routine payments to the third party freight consolidator which were improperly not remitted to the freight carriers 
the actions of the third party freight consolidator  which has since filed for bankruptcy protection  resulted in a loss to the company which the company currently does not expect to recover 
the company has since changed its procedures to pay freight carriers directly and taken other actions to mitigate this and similar risks 
the cost of raw materials used in the production of doughnut mix and of other goods sold to company and franchise stores was higher in fiscal than in fiscal in particular  the prices of flour and shortening and the products from which they are made were significantly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  kk supply chain increased the prices charged to company and franchise stores for doughnut mixes  shortening and other goods in order to mitigate increases in the cost of these raw materials 
however  while kk supply chain increased prices to cover its increased costs  profit margins as a percentage of sales decreased 
recent economic conditions have led to significant reductions in the price of certain commodities  including wheat and food oils 
these reductions have lowered kk supply chain s cost of flour and shortening  and enabled kk supply chain to reduce the prices charged to the company and franchise stores for doughnut mixes and shortening in the fourth quarter of fiscal these prices were lowered further in the first quarter of fiscal to reflect additional cost reductions 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses include a net credit of approximately  to the bad debt provision in fiscal compared to a charge of approximately million in fiscal the net credit in fiscal reflects a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts resulting principally from a decrease in credit exposure with respect to certain franchisees and a recovery of certain receivables previously reserved  partially offset by bad debt provisions recorded with respect to other franchise receivables 
as of february   the company s allowance for doubtful accounts from franchisees totaled approximately million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal include approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter for severance costs related to the resignation of the company s former chief executive officer  of which approximately million was share based compensation including accelerated vesting of certain equity awards 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses also reflects a decrease in other share based compensation expense of approximately  due principally to executive officer turnover resulting in the forfeiture of stock and option awards  and the elimination of most incentive compensation costs in fiscal due to the company s failure to achieve incentive compensation targets for the year  which reduced incentive compensation costs by approximately million from fiscal these decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a charge of approximately million in fiscal related to changes in the company s vacation policy 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal include an out of period credit of approximately  related to the company s self insured worker s compensation program  and these costs in fiscal include unusual credits of  relating to the settlement of certain charitable pledge obligations 
general and administrative expenses include professional fees and expenses related to the investigations and securities litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  which totaled approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company expects these costs will be substantially reduced in fiscal as a result of the conclusion of the sec investigation 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable principally to the reduction in the number of company factory stores operating in fiscal compared to fiscal  and to a lower depreciable base of property and equipment resulting from impairment writedowns 
in addition  depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the company s divestiture in january of its manufacturing and distribution facility in effingham  illinois 
impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal impairment charges related to long lived assets totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal  of which approximately  and million  respectively  related to underperforming stores 
the charges relate to stores closed or expected to be closed  as well as charges with respect to stores management believes will not generate sufficient future cash flows to enable the company to recover the carrying value of the stores assets  but which management has not yet decided to close 
the company closed six stores in fiscal and nine stores in fiscal the company tests long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these events and changes in circumstances include store closing decisions  the effects of changing costs including commodity costs on current results of operations  observed trends in operating results  and evidence of changed circumstances observed as a part of periodic reforecasts of future operating results and as part of the company s annual budgeting process 
the company records impairment charges associated with stores in the accounting period in which a store closing decision is made or in which the carrying value of the store is otherwise determined to be nonrecoverable 
in addition  in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million with respect to its kk supply chain manufacturing and distribution facility in effingham  illinois  based on management s revised expectations about the use and ultimate disposition of that facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company decided to divest the facility and determined that the projected cash flows from operation and ultimate sale of the facility were less than its carrying value  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the facility and related equipment to their estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold these assets for approximately million cash net of expenses  which approximated the company s earlier estimate of their disposal value 
also during fiscal  the company decided to close its kk supply chain coffee roasting operation and to sell the related assets  and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of those assets to their estimated disposal value of million 
the company sold these assets for approximately million cash during the third quarter of fiscal lease termination costs represent the net present value of remaining contractual lease payments related to closed stores  after reduction by estimated sublease rentals  and are recorded when the lease contract is terminated or  if earlier  the date on which the company ceases use of the leased property 
in fiscal  changes in estimated sublease rentals on a closed store that was subsequently refranchised and the realization of proceeds on an assignment of another closed store lease resulted in million of credits to the provision for lease termination costs 
these credits  in combination with the reversal of approximately  of previously recorded deferred rent expense related to stores closed during the year and approximately million of charges related to other closed store leases  resulted in a net credit in the provision for lease termination costs of  in fiscal in fiscal  the company received proceeds of  on the assignment of leases related to closed stores  reversed approximately million of previously recorded deferred rent expense related to stores closed during the year and recorded approximately million of charges related to other closed store leases  resulting in a net provision for lease termination costs of million in fiscal the company plans to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeastern united states 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
in fiscal  the company refranchised one idled store acquired by the company from a failed franchisee  refranchised two domestic operating stores to a new franchisee  and refranchised the four company stores in canada to a new franchisee 
the company received no proceeds in connection with any of these transactions 
with the exception of a non cash gain related to foreign currency translation arising from the canadian disposal  no significant gain or loss was recognized as a result of the refranchisings 
the company cannot predict the likelihood of refranchising any additional stores or markets or the amount of proceeds  if any  which might be received therefrom  including the amounts which might be realized from the sale of store assets and the execution of any related franchise agreements 
refranchising could result in the recognition of impairment losses on the related assets 
settlement of litigation in the first quarter of fiscal  the company issued common stock and warrants to acquire common stock in connection with the settlement of a federal securities class action and to settle  in part  certain shareholder derivative actions  as more fully described in item  legal proceedings and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company recorded a charge to earnings in fiscal for the fair value of the stock and warrants  measured as of the date on which the company agreed to settle the litigation  and adjusted that charge in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the securities fair value until their issuance in the first quarter of fiscal such subsequent adjustment resulted in a non cash credit to fiscal earnings of million 
interest income interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to lower short term interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest accruing on outstanding indebtedness was lower in fiscal than in fiscal because of a reduction in outstanding debt since the first quarter of fiscal this lower interest on outstanding indebtedness was partially offset by higher lender margin and fees resulting from the amendments to the company s secured credit facilities as described under liquidity and capital resources below and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
in addition  in fiscal the company charged to interest expense approximately  of fees and expenses associated with the amendments  and expensed approximately  of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the reduction in the size of the company s revolving credit facility from million to million 
interest expense for fiscal reflects a non cash charge of approximately  resulting from marking to market the company s liabilities related to interest rate derivatives 
as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources below and note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  effective april   the company discontinued hedge accounting for certain interest rate derivatives as a result of amendments to its credit facilities 
as a consequence of the discontinuance of hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts subsequent to april  are reflected in earnings as they occur 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts for periods prior to april  are being charged to earnings through april when the underlying hedged transactions interest expense on long term debt affect earnings 
as of february   the fair value of the derivative liability was approximately million  which is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
accumulated other comprehensive income as of february  includes an unamortized accumulated loss related to these derivatives of approximately  net of income taxes of approximately

fiscal contained weeks 
excluding sales for the rd week in fiscal  systemwide sales decreased compared to fiscal  reflecting a decrease in average weekly sales per store  partially offset by a increase in store operating weeks 
the systemwide sales decrease reflects an decrease in company stores sales and a increase in franchise store sales 
during fiscal  one new company factory store and new franchise factory stores were opened  nine company factory stores and franchise factory stores were closed  and three company factory stores and four franchise factory stores were converted from factory stores to satellite stores 
the total number of factory stores at the end of fiscal was  consisting of company stores and franchise stores 
satellite stores made up of the total systemwide store count as of february  compared to at january  systemwide average weekly sales per store are lower than company average weekly sales per store principally because satellite stores  which generally have lower average weekly sales than factory stores  are operated almost exclusively by franchisees 
in addition  the increasing percentage of total stores which are satellite stores has the effect of reducing the overall systemwide average weekly sales per store 
revenues for fiscal  revenues decreased to million from million in fiscal excluding revenues for the rd week  revenues for fiscal decreased to million

company stores revenues were million in fiscal excluding revenues for the rd week  company stores revenues were million  a decrease of from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues measured on a week basis reflects a decline in store operating weeks partially offset by a increase in average weekly sales per store 
the decrease in store operating weeks reflects the sale or closure of factory stores since the end of fiscal the increase in the average weekly sales per store reflects  among other things  the closure of relatively poorer performing locations and the benefits of consolidating production for wholesale customers into a smaller number of factory stores  as well as the effects of price increases 
on premises sales which include fundraising sales comprised approximately and of total company stores revenues in fiscal and  respectively  with the balance comprised of off premises sales 
the following table sets forth statistical data with respect to on and off premises sales by company stores 
the data have been computed by comparing the weeks ended january  to the weeks ended january  the change in same store sales is computed by dividing the aggregate on premises sales including fundraising sales during the current year period for all stores which had been open for more than consecutive weeks during the current year but only to the extent such sales occurred in the th or later week of each store s operation by the aggregate on premises sales of such stores for the comparable weeks in the preceding year 
once a store has been open for at least consecutive weeks  its sales are included in the computation of same stores sales for all subsequent periods 
in the event a store is closed temporarily for example  for remodeling and has no sales during one or more weeks  such store s sales for the comparable weeks during the earlier or subsequent period are excluded from the same store sales computation 
for off premises sales  average weekly number of doors represents the average number of customer locations to which product deliveries are made during a week  and average weekly sales per door represents the average weekly sales to each such location 
weeks ended jan 
 on premises change in same store sales off premises change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door on premises same stores sales were flat for the year  generally reflecting an increase in the average guest check offset by reduced customer traffic 
the decrease in the average weekly number of doors represents a decrease in the grocery mass merchant channel  partially offset by an increase in the average weekly number of doors in the convenience store channel 
the average weekly sales per door fell in both channels 
a decrease in average weekly sales per door generally adversely affects profitability because of the increased significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
in addition  delivery costs have been rising due to  among other things  rising fuel costs 
franchise revenues 
franchise revenues consist principally of royalties payable to the company by franchisees based upon the franchisees sales and initial franchise fees earned by the company in connection with new store openings by franchisees

all of the growth in franchisee sales in fiscal was attributable to an increase in the number of franchise stores outside the united states 
domestic franchisee sales fell in fiscal  principally due to store closings in fiscal and franchisee fees declined approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal franchise fee revenue included approximately  of fees related to amendments to agreements with certain international franchisees 
the development and franchise agreements with these franchisees contemplated development only of factory stores  and were amended to provide for initial franchise fees for satellite stores and to provide for development of satellite stores to be partially creditable against the franchisees store development obligations 
the company did not record initial franchise fees related to these franchisees satellite stores until the company agreed with the franchisees on the amount of initial franchise fee to be paid with respect to these stores 
this decrease in franchise fees was offset by an increase in franchise fees arising from an increase in store openings by franchisees in compared to franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
kk supply chain revenues 
kk supply chain revenues were million in fiscal excluding the rd week  kk supply chain revenues were million  a decrease from million in fiscal the most significant reason for the decrease in revenues measured on a week basis was lower sales by domestic franchisees  which resulted in an approximate decrease in sales of mixes  icings and fillings  sugar  shortening and supplies by kk supply chain 
in addition  an increasing percentage of franchisee sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
in certain instances  instead of selling finished doughnut mix to international franchisees  the company sells doughnut mix concentrate  which is combined with other ingredients sourced locally to produce doughnut mix 
while the kk supply chain s profit on sales of concentrate is intended to be similar to the profit which would be earned on the finished mix made from that concentrate  sales of concentrate generate less revenue than would sales of an equivalent amount of finished mix 
in addition  many of the other ingredients and supplies used by international franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
the kk supply chain revenue decrease was also attributable to a decrease in sales of equipment and equipment services in fiscal compared to fiscal franchisee expansion in fiscal was comprised principally of satellite stores  which require less equipment than do factory stores 
sales of equipment and related services measured on a week basis including signage  beverage equipment  furniture  fixtures and similar items sold through the kk supply chain distribution centers represented approximately and of kk supply chain revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal a significant majority of kk supply chain s revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows

these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased depreciation charges related to the company s mix manufacturing and distribution facility in effingham  illinois  which the company divested in january  the estimated useful life of which was adjusted downward at the end of the second quarter of fiscal as a consequence of the company s decision to divest the facility 
total depreciation expense related to the effingham facility was approximately million in fiscal impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal impairment charges related to long lived assets totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal  of which approximately million and million  respectively  related to the company stores segment

these factors were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from  among other things  the elimination of most corporate incentive compensation costs in fiscal due to the company s failure to achieve its incentive compensation targets for the year 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities in fiscal reflects a cash outflow of approximately million for the prepayment fee associated with the refinancing of the company s credit facilities as described under cash flow from financing activities below and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
operating cash flow was adversely affected in fiscal compared to fiscal by a million reduction in accrued interest from year end to year end arising from the change in the last day of the fiscal year relative to the last day of january 
in addition  receipts of development and franchise fees were approximately million higher in fiscal than in fiscal  such fees are deferred and not recognized in earnings until the related stores are opened 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was affected by professional and other fees related to the investigations and securities litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein

accordingly  completion of these capital projects is dependent upon the sufficiency of such funds to meet the company s capital expenditure needs  after providing for the company s other cash requirements  including debt service

business conditions  uncertainties and liquidity the company experienced a decline in revenues and incurred net losses in each of the last three fiscal years 
the revenue decline reflects fewer company stores in operation  a decline in domestic royalty revenues and lower sales of mixes and other ingredients resulting from lower sales by the company s domestic franchisees 
lower revenues have adversely affected operating margins because of the fixed or semi fixed nature of many of the company s direct operating expenses 
in addition  price increases in the company stores segment were not sufficient to fully offset steep rises in agricultural commodity costs in fiscal compared to fiscal  although recent economic conditions have led to significant reductions in the market prices of these commodities  which had a positive effect on the company s results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and which the company believes will positively affect fiscal results 
sales volumes and changes in the cost of major ingredients and fuel can have a material effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  royalty revenues and most of kk supply chain revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
the company generated net cash from operating activities of million  million and million  in fiscal   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal reflects a cash outflow of approximately million for a prepayment penalty on the refinancing of indebtedness 
asset dispositions generated investing cash flows of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  with the majority of such proceeds used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s secured credit facilities 
the company s secured credit facilities described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein are the company s principal source of external financing 
these facilities consist of a term loan having an outstanding principal balance of million as of february  which matures in february and a million revolving credit facility maturing in february the secured credit facilities contain significant financial covenants as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company was in compliance with those financial covenants as of february   although those covenants were scheduled to become more stringent in fiscal subsequent to year end  the company executed amendments to the credit facilities which  among other things  relaxed the interest coverage ratio covenants contained therein through fiscal in connection with the amendments  the company prepaid million of the principal balance outstanding under the term loan  paid fees of approximately million  and agreed to increase the rate of interest on outstanding loans by basis points annually 
any future amendments or waivers could result in additional fees or rate increases 
based on the company s current working capital and the fiscal operating plan  management believes the company can comply with the amended financial covenants and that the company can meet its projected operating  investing and financing cash requirements 
failure to comply with the financial covenants contained in the secured credit facilities  or the occurrence or failure to occur of certain events  would cause the company to default under the facilities 
the company would attempt to negotiate waivers of any such default  should one occur 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to negotiate any such waivers  and the costs or conditions associated with any such waivers could be significant 
in the absence of a waiver of  or forbearance with respect to  any such default  the company s lenders would be able to exercise their rights under the credit agreement including  but not limited to  accelerating maturity of outstanding indebtedness and asserting their rights with respect to the collateral 
acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness under the secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in the event that credit under the secured credit facilities were not available to the company  there can be no assurance that alternative sources of credit would be available to the company or  if they are available  under what terms or at what cost 
capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to cash flow generated from operations  the company utilizes other capital resources and financing arrangements to fund its business 
these other resources and arrangements have assumed increased importance in light of the reduced cash flows provided by operations 
a discussion of these capital resources and financing techniques is included below 
debt the company continuously monitors its funding requirements for general working capital purposes and other financing and investing activities 
in the last three fiscal years  management focused on reducing or eliminating the company s investments in franchisees and the related guarantees of franchisees obligations  and on restructuring the company s borrowing arrangements to maintain credit availability to facilitate accomplishing the company s business restructuring initiatives 
on february   the company closed secured credit facilities totaling million the secured credit facilities 
the facilities then consisted of a million revolving credit facility maturing in february the revolver and a million term loan maturing in february the term loan 
the secured credit facilities are secured by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries 
at closing  the company borrowed the full million available under the term loan  and used the proceeds to retire approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under the company s former secured credit facilities which were then retired  to pay prepayment premiums under the former secured credit facilities and to pay fees and expenses associated with the secured credit facilities 
the company recorded a pretax charge related to the refinancing of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  representing the approximately million prepayment fee related to the former secured credit facilities and the write off of approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to that facility 
the revolver contains provisions which permit the company to obtain letters of credit 
issuance of letters of credit under these provisions constitutes usage of the lending commitments  and reduces the amount available for cash borrowings under the revolver 
the commitments under the revolver were reduced to million from million in connection with the amendments to the secured credit facilities executed in april the april amendments 
in connection with the april amendments  the company prepaid million of the principal balance outstanding under the term loan 
the company expects to record a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal related to the amendments 
interest on borrowings under the revolver and term loan is payable either at libor or at the alternate base rate which is the greater of fed funds rate plus or the prime rate  in each case plus the applicable margin 
after giving effect to the april amendments  the applicable margin for libor based loans and for alternate base rate based loans was and  respectively and  respectively  prior to the april amendments 
in addition  the secured credit facilities provide that libor based loans shall be computed based upon the greater of the relevant libor rate or the company is required to pay a fee equal to the applicable margin for libor based loans on the outstanding amount of letters of credit issued under the revolver  as well as a fronting fee of of the amount of such letter of credit payable to the letter of credit issuer 
there also is a fee on the unused portion of the revolver lending commitment  which increased from to in connection with the april amendments 
borrowings under the revolver and issuances of letters of credit are subject to the satisfaction of usual and customary conditions  including accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults 
the term loan is payable in quarterly installments of approximately  and a final installment equal to the remaining principal balance in february the term loan is required to be prepaid with some or all of the net proceeds of certain equity issuances  debt incurrences  asset sales and casualty events and with a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the agreement on an annual basis 
the secured credit facilities require the company to meet certain financial tests  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio expressed as a ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio expressed as a ratio of consolidated ebitda to net interest expense  computed based upon consolidated ebitda and net interest expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters and total debt as of the end of such four quarter period 
as of february   the consolidated leverage ratio was required to be not greater than to and the consolidated interest coverage ratio was required to be not less than to as of february   the company s consolidated leverage ratio was approximately to and the company s consolidated interest coverage ratio was approximately to the maximum consolidated leverage ratio declines during fiscal to to and declines thereafter until it reaches to in fiscal the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio decreases during fiscal to to and increases thereafter until it reaches to in fiscal consolidated ebitda is a non gaap measure and is defined in the secured credit facilities to mean  generally  consolidated net income or loss  exclusive of unrealized gains and losses on hedging instruments  gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt and provisions for payments on guarantees of franchisee obligations plus the sum of net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash charges  store closure costs  costs associated with certain litigation and investigations  and extraordinary professional fees  and minus payments  if any  on guarantees of franchisee obligations in excess of million in any rolling quarter period and the sum of non cash credits 
effective in april  net interest expense excludes amounts paid under the interest rate derivative contracts described below 
in addition  the secured credit facilities contain other covenants which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness including guarantees  liens  investments including investments in and advances to franchisees which own and operate krispy kreme stores  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  capital expenditures  mergers and consolidations  prepayments of other indebtedness and other activities customarily restricted in such agreements 
the secured credit facilities also prohibit the transfer of cash or other assets to kkdi from its subsidiaries  whether by dividend  loan or otherwise  but provide for exceptions to enable kkdi to pay taxes and operating expenses and certain judgment and settlement costs 
the operation of the restrictive financial covenants described above may limit the amount the company may borrow under the revolver 
in addition  the maximum amount which may be borrowed under the revolver is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit  which totaled approximately million as of february  the maximum additional borrowing available to the company as of february  was approximately million computed on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the april amendments 
the secured credit facilities also contain customary events of default  including without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to other indebtedness in excess of million  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  judgment defaults in excess of million and the occurrence of a change of control 
in may  the company entered into interest rate derivative contracts having an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
the derivative contracts eliminate the company s exposure  with respect to such notional amount  to increases in three month libor beyond through april  and eliminate the company s ability to benefit from a reduction in three month libor below for the same period 
these derivatives were accounted for as cash flow hedges from their inception through april  hedge accounting was discontinued on that date because the derivative contracts could no longer be shown to be effective as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in hedging interest rate risk as a result of the april amendments  which provide that interest on libor based borrowings is payable at the greater of the libor rate for the selected interest period or 
as a consequence of the discontinuance of hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts subsequent to april  are reflected in earnings as they occur 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts for periods prior to april  are being charged to earnings in the periods in which the hedged forecasted transaction interest on million of the principal balance of the term loan affects earnings 
as of february   the fair value of the derivatives was a liability of approximately million  which is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
accumulated other comprehensive income as of february  includes an unamortized accumulated loss related to these derivatives of approximately  net of income taxes of approximately 
leases the company conducts some of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment 
generally  these leases have initial terms of three to twenty years and contain provisions for renewal options of five to ten years 
in determining whether to enter into a lease for an asset  the company evaluates the nature of the asset and the associated lease terms to determine if leasing is an effective financing tool 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of sec regulation s k  consist principally of the company s guarantees of indebtedness and lease obligations of certain franchisees  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
contractual cash obligations at february  the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  are as follows payments due in less more than than total amount year years years years in thousands long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities    interest payment obligations     payment obligations on interest rate hedge   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   guarantee obligations      other long term obligations  including current portion  reflected on the company s balance sheet self insurance claims      k mirror plan liability total      long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities has been computed on a proforma basis to reflect the prepayment in april of million of borrowings outstanding under the company s secured credit facilities in connection with amendments to these facilities 
estimated interest payments for variable rate debt are based upon the forward libor interest rate curve as of january  and have been computed on a pro forma basis to give effect to the amendments to the company s secured credit facilities executed in april and to reflect the prepayment of million of the borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
represents estimated amounts payable without reduction for any amount due to the company or payable by the company pursuant to an interest rate derivative agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
interest rates utilized to estimate payments on the interest rate derivative are based upon the forward libor interest rate curve as of january  amounts represent of the company s aggregate exposure at february  under loan and lease guarantees related to franchisees in which the company has an ownership interest 
subsequent to february   the aggregate amount of such exposure was reduced to million 
the preceding table of contractual cash obligations excludes income tax liabilities of approximately  as of february  for unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty in predicting the timing of any such related payments 
capital requirements in the next five years  the company plans to use cash primarily for the following activities working capital and other corporate purposes opening new company stores in selected markets  principally small retail concept shops remodeling and relocation of selected older company shops investments in systems and personnel the company s capital requirements for these activities may be significant 
these capital requirements will depend on many factors including the company s overall performance  the pace of store expansion and company store remodels and infrastructure needs for both personnel and facilities 
these capital outlays are subject to limitations contained in the secured credit facilities 
inflation the company does not believe that general price inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  prices of agricultural commodities have been trending upward in recent years  and those price increases have had a significant effect on the cost of flour and shortening  the two most significant ingredients used in the production of the company s products 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures  including disclosures of contingencies and uncertainties 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of changes in facts and circumstances and discusses the selection of accounting policies and significant accounting judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that application of the following accounting policies involves judgments and estimates that are among the more significant used in the preparation of the financial statements  and that an understanding of these policies is important to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties earned on sales by the company s franchisees  sales by kk supply chain to our franchisees of equipment  mix and other supplies necessary to operate a krispy kreme store  as well as from off premises sales by company stores to convenience and grocery stores and other customers 
during the three years in the period ended february   some of the company s franchisees experienced financial difficulties or for other reasons did not comply with the normal payment terms for settlement of amounts due to the company 
the company has recorded provisions for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable  including receivables from franchisees  in amounts which management believes are sufficient to provide for losses estimated to be sustained on realization of these receivables 
such estimates inherently involve uncertainties and assessments of the outcome of future events  and changes in facts and circumstances may result in adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets fas  goodwill and other intangible assets fas  addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
fas requires intangible assets with definite lives to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  while those with indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but must be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate potential impairment 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company performs the annual test for impairment as of december the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets involves comparing the fair value of such assets with their carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value recorded as an impairment charge 
the goodwill impairment test involves determining the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and comparing those fair values to the reporting units carrying values  including goodwill 
to determine fair value for each reporting unit  the company uses the discounted cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
the company also considers the estimated fair values of its reporting units relative to the company s overall market capitalization in connection with its goodwill impairment assessment 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of reporting units 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results and the balances of goodwill in the future could be affected by impairment charges 
impairment analyses of goodwill resulted in impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal there were no goodwill impairment charges in fiscal as of february   the remaining goodwill had a carrying value of million  all of which was associated with the franchise segment 
the risk of goodwill impairment would increase in the event that the franchise segment operating results were to significantly deteriorate or the overall market capitalization of the company were to decline below the book value of the company s shareholders equity 
asset impairment when an asset group typically a store is identified as underperforming or when a decision is made to abandon an asset group or to close a store  the company makes an assessment of the potential impairment of the related assets 
the assessment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets  primarily property and equipment  to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from those assets 
to estimate cash flows  management projects the net cash flows anticipated from continuing operation of the asset group or store until its closing or abandonment  as well as cash flows  if any  anticipated from disposal of the related assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their estimated fair value 
determining undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of an asset group involves estimating future cash flows  revenues  operating expenses and disposal values 
the projections of these amounts represent management s best estimates at the time of the review 
if different cash flows had been estimated  property and equipment balances and related impairment charges could have been affected 
further  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results could be affected 
in addition  the sale of assets whose carrying value has been reduced by impairment charges could result in the recognition of gains or losses to the extent the sales proceeds realized differ from the reduced carrying amount of the assets 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
insurance the company is subject to workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims 
the company is self insured for the cost of all workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims up to the amount of stop loss insurance coverage purchased by the company from commercial insurance carriers 
the company maintains accruals for the estimated cost of claims on an undiscounted basis  without regard to the effects of stop loss coverage  using actuarial methods which evaluate known open and incurred but not reported claims and consider historical loss development experience 
in addition  the company records receivables from the insurance carriers for claims amounts estimated to be recovered under the stop loss insurance policies when these amounts are estimable and probable of collection 
the company estimates such stop loss receivables using the same actuarial methods used to establish the related claims accruals  and taking into account the amount of risk transferred to the carriers under the stop loss policies 
many estimates and assumptions are involved in estimating future claims  and differences between future events and prior estimates and assumptions could affect future operating results and result in adjustments to these loss accruals and related insurance receivables 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon management s expectation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred  or expenses which already have been deducted in the company s tax return but which have not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent tax deductions or credits that will be reflected in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets as required under fas  accounting for income taxes 
at february   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of million  representing the total amount of such assets in excess of the company s deferred income tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management was unable to conclude  in light of the cumulative losses realized by the company  that realization of the net deferred income tax asset was more likely than not 
the determination of income tax expense and the related balance sheet accounts  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including future operating results and the outcome of tax related contingencies 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amount of income tax assets and liabilities  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  could be materially affected 
guarantee liabilities the company has guaranteed a portion of loan and lease obligations of certain franchisees in which the company owns an interest 
the company assesses the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantees and records estimated liabilities for anticipated payments when the company believes that an obligation to perform under the guarantees is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
no liabilities for the guarantees were recorded at the time they were issued because the company believed the value of the guarantees was immaterial 
as of february   the company has recorded liabilities of approximately million related to such guarantees  which totaled approximately million at that date 
assessing the probability of future guarantee payments involves estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amounts estimated to be paid pursuant to such guarantees could change  and additional provisions to record such liabilities could be required 
investments in franchisees the company has investments in certain equity method franchisees  the value of which cannot be verified by reference to quoted market prices 
the company s assessment of the realizability of these investments involves assumptions concerning future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated by the company  the assessment of realizability of the recorded investments in these entities could change  and impairment provisions related to these investments could be required 
as of february   the company s investment in equity method franchisees was approximately million 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share based payment sbp awards based on their fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
because options granted to employees differ from options on the company s common shares traded in the financial markets  the company cannot determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on observed market prices 
accordingly  the company estimates the fair value of stock options subject only to service conditions using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires inputs including interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and employee exercise behavior patterns 
some of the inputs the company uses are not market observable and must be estimated 
the fair value of stock options which contain market conditions as well as service conditions is estimated using monte carlo simulation techniques 
in addition  the company must estimate the number of awards which ultimately will vest  and periodically adjusts such estimates to reflect actual vesting events 
use of different estimates and assumptions would produce different option values  which in turn would affect the amount of compensation expense recognized 
the black scholes model is capable of considering the specific features included in the options granted to the company s employees that are subject only to service conditions 
however  there are other models which could be used to estimate their fair value  and techniques other than monte carlo simulation could be used to estimate the value of stock options which are subject to both service and market conditions 
if the company were to use different models  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using different valuation models could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements effective february  the first day of fiscal  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
fas addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap 
as a result of fas  there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap  which is expected to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of fas relating to nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
the company must adopt the fas measurement principles with respect to these nonfinancial assets and liabilities in fiscal adoption of fas for financial assets and liabilities did not have any material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations and adoption of fas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not expected to have any material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
see note for additional information regarding fair value measurement 
effective january  the first day of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes recognition thresholds that must be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
the company recorded the cumulative effect of adopting fin as a million credit to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of january   the date of adoption 
principally as a result of the dissolution of one of the company s foreign subsidiaries and the resolution of related income tax uncertainties during fiscal  the company recorded credit of approximately million to the provision for income taxes to reduce the company s accruals for uncertain tax positions 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
the company adopted fas as of february  the first day of fiscal and did not elect any fair value measurement options permitted by fas and  accordingly  fas did not have any effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
the new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
fas is effective for the company in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on its outstanding debt 
all of the borrowings under the company s secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon either the fed funds rate or libor 
the interest cost of the company s debt is affected by changes in these short term interest rates and increases in those rates adversely affect the company s results of operations 
on may   the company entered into interest rate derivative contracts having an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
the derivative contracts eliminate the company s exposure to increases in three month libor beyond through april  and eliminate the company s ability to benefit from a reduction in three month libor below for the same period 
as of february   the company had approximately million in borrowings outstanding 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a decrease in the company s annual interest expense of approximately  the hypothetical rate increase would reduce amounts payable by the company on the million outstanding notional balance of interest rate derivatives  while resulting in no increase in interest expense on the company s term debt due to the operation of an interest rate floor provision in the company s credit agreement 
the company s credit facilities and the related interest rate derivatives are described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
the company s investment in its franchisee operating in mexico exposes the company to exchange rate risk 
in addition  although royalties from international franchisees are payable to the company in us dollars  changes in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies used in the countries in which the international franchisees operate affect the company s royalty revenues 
recently  the us dollar has strengthened relative to many other currencies  strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of international franchisees adversely affects franchise revenue 
because royalty revenues are derived from a relatively large number of foreign countries  and royalty revenues are not highly concentrated in a small number of countries  the company believes that the relatively small size of any currency hedging activities would adversely affect the economics of hedging strategies and  accordingly  the company historically has not attempted to hedge these exchange rate risks 
the company is exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations in the cost of ingredients of its products  of which flour  sugar and shortening are the most significant 
in order to secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients  the company routinely enters into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers 
under the forward purchase contracts  the company commits to purchasing agreed upon quantities of ingredients at agreed upon prices at specified future dates 
the outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from one month s to two years anticipated requirements  depending on the ingredient 
other purchase arrangements typically are contractual arrangements with vendors for example  with respect to certain beverages and ingredients under which the company is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of goods  but must purchase minimum percentages of its requirements for such goods from these vendors with whom it has executed these contracts 
in addition to entering into forward purchase contracts  from time to time the company purchases exchange traded commodity futures contracts  and options on such contracts  for raw materials which are ingredients of its products or which are components of such ingredients  including wheat and soybean oil 
the company typically assigns the futures contract to a supplier in connection with entering into a forward purchase contract for the related ingredient 
there were no unassigned commodity futures or options on such contracts as of february  although the company utilizes forward purchase contracts and futures contracts and options on such contracts to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuations  such contracts do not fully mitigate commodity price risk 
in addition  the portion of the company s anticipated future commodity requirements that is subject to such contracts varies from time to time 
prices for agricultural commodities have been volatile in the past two years and have traded at record high prices during this period  although recent economic conditions have led to significant reductions in the market prices of agricultural and other commodities  including wheat and soybean oil 
adverse changes in commodity prices could adversely affect the company s profitability and liquidity 
the following table illustrates the potential effect on the company s costs resulting from hypothetical changes in the cost of the company s three most significant ingredients 
approximate approximate range approximate annual anticipated fiscal of prices paid in hypothetical price effect of hypothetical ingredient purchases fiscal increase price increase in thousands flour million lbs
