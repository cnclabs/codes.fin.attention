business strategy and overview industry overview our profitability is substantially determined by the difference between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil  which is referred to below as refined product margins 
beginning in the second half of and continuing through the first half of  crude oil prices climbed rapidly until peaking at a record high in early july while product prices increased more gradually than crude oil prices resulting in a weak margin environment 
for example  from july through june the price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased by approximately  while the average spot price for gasoline on the us west coast rose only 
the rapid increase in crude oil prices was attributed in part to such factors as continued global demand growth  concerns over declining crude oil supplies and increasing investments in crude oil to hedge against the weakening us dollar 
gasoline prices increased less dramatically than crude oil prices during the period due to falling domestic demand and high product inventories 
nymex wti bbl graph after crude oil prices peaked in early july  recessionary concerns  declining global demand and the strengthening of the us dollar resulted in a sharp decline in crude oil prices through the end of the year 
gasoline prices declined with falling crude oil prices due to declining demand  however  lower industry production and the impacts of hurricanes gustav and ike in september strengthened gasoline margins in september and october 
gasoline margins declined through the remainder of the year with the exception of margins on the us west coast 
beginning in mid december both planned and unplanned refinery outages combined with historically low gasoline inventories to benefit margins 
despite the overall decline in gasoline margins in as compared to  diesel fuel margins were higher than levels due to continued strong global demand and low inventories 
strategy and goals our strategy is to create a value added refining and marketing business that has i economies of scale  ii a competitive cost structure  iii effective management information systems that enable success and iv outstanding employees focused on achieving operational excellence in a global market in order to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment 

table of contents we focus our goals on i operating our facilities in a safe  reliable  and environmentally responsible way  ii improving cash flow by achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies  and iii using excess cash flows from operations to create further shareholder value 
we previously announced that our value creation strategy would focus on pursuing internal yield and cost benefits rather than external acquisitions 
this change in our strategy was timely as the industry has recently experienced declining refining margins 
we developed initiatives in late to improve profitability at our los angeles and hawaii refineries and developed initiatives at our other refineries in in response to a lower refining margin environment 
these and other company wide initiatives are designed to minimize borrowings on our revolving credit facility and fund capital expenditures solely from operating cash flow 
we funded our capital program through operating cash flow and minimized borrowings by accomplishing the following initiatives during optimized inventories to better match lower demand resulting in an inventory reduction of approximately million barrels from the end of reduced capital expenditures to million from our original capital budget of million 
most projects impacted by this reduction have been delayed or adjusted in scope rather than canceled  and improved capture of available margins our ability to realize a higher percentage of industry margins by i refining lower cost crude oils as a result of operating the delayed coker at the golden eagle refinery beginning in the second quarter  ii refining a greater percentage of lower cost  waterborne crude oils at the los angeles refinery  iii optimizing our diesel fuel and gasoline production to respond to market demand  iv adjusting our run rates and feedstock mix to respond to current market conditions particularly at our washington refinery  and v implementing initiatives at our hawaii refinery primarily focused on processing lower cost crude oils and improving reliability 
in  our goals are to continue to gain sustainable improvements in our capture of available margins  lower break even costs and fund our capital program through operating cash flow 
plans to improve our capture of available margins in include i lowering crude costs through benefits of our prior years capital programs  ii further capitalizing on shipping economies of scale  iii increasing crude flexibility  iv continuing to match production to demand and v optimizing diesel fuel and gasoline production 
we plan to reduce operating expenses through energy efficiency and maintenance efficiency programs 
golden eagle coker modification project the delayed coker at our golden eagle refinery became fully operational during the second quarter 
spending since inception totaled million 
the modification of our fluid coker unit to a delayed coker enabled us to comply with the terms of an abatement order to lower air emissions while also enhancing the refinery s capabilities in terms of crude oil flexibility  reliability  lengthening turnaround cycles and lowering maintenance costs 
the project will significantly reduce the duration and costs of coker turnarounds as well as increase the coker turnaround cycle from years to years 
in addition  we expect the modified coker to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the refinery 
selective hydrogenation unit the selective hydrogenation unit shu at our washington refinery was fully operational during the fourth quarter and reduces the sulfur content in gasoline 
the shu allows a higher percentage of sour crude oils to be processed at the refinery while maintaining compliance with gasoline sulfur regulations 
future strategic capital projects we have identified short term  high return projects that focus on lowering our feedstock costs  improving clean product yields and reducing operating costs  including improving energy efficiency at all of our refineries 
these projects  which are currently under evaluation  are not included in our capital budget 
however  certain of these projects may be implemented in or thereafter as we have cash flow available from operations 
additionally  our long term capital plans include larger projects to further reduce feedstock costs at our golden 
table of contents eagle  los angeles and hawaii refineries 
all of these projects are preliminary and subject to further review and analysis 
hedging program we periodically enter into non trading derivative arrangements primarily to manage price risks associated with the purchase and or sale of crude oil and finished products involving inventories above our target levels 
these derivative arrangements typically involve exchange traded futures and over the counter swaps  generally with durations of one year or less 
historically  we hedged less than of our crude oil and products operating volumes 
the crude oil hedges have primarily covered price risks of foreign crude oils supplied to our hawaii and golden eagle refineries 
a smaller percentage of the hedges covered west coast intermediate and finished products 
during the second quarter  we closed the majority of our crude oil derivative positions associated with our long haul strategy that matched the price of long haul crude oils to day of processing product margin 
these closed positions did not have a further significant impact on earnings 
the impact of the rapidly rising crude oil prices in the first six months of on our derivative positions was a pretax loss of million 
during the second half of  declining crude oil prices resulted in a pretax gain of million 
net earnings for the year included a pretax loss of million on our derivative positions 
hawaii refinery initiatives we implemented several initiatives to improve profitability at our hawaii refinery in response to falling gross refining margins during and the first half of one key initiative was to reduce our reliance on light sweet crude oil from asia to achieve crude oil cost savings 
starting in the first quarter  we began to run more cost advantaged heavy sweet and light sour crude oils reducing our light sweet crude oils as a percent of total throughput to from a year ago 
we also increased our percentage of heavy crude oil to total throughput from in to in another initiative was completed in march when we improved reliability through the completion of a new electrical substation 
we also completed a controls modernization project during the fourth quarter which is designed to improve reliability and refining yields and reduce energy costs 
los angeles refinery initiatives since acquiring the los angeles refinery in may  we achieved our annual synergy goal of million during the second quarter mainly through shared crude oil cargo benefits and other feedstock activities 
we expect to realize annual recurring synergies of approximately million through our crude oil purchasing and shipping logistics as well as by maximizing the production of clean fuels for the california market 
our initiatives to improve profitability at our los angeles refinery in included optimizing our crude oil supply  increasing distillate production and reducing operating expenses 
during the second quarter  we opted not to renew the remaining crude oil contracts assumed in the acquisition  which allows us to process more cost advantaged foreign crude oils 
beginning in june  we also increased distillate production by approximately  barrels per day versus the last half of to take advantage of the strong distillate margins 
recent developments as widely reported  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months  including  among other things  extreme volatility in prices of securities  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
these conditions  including severely restricted new credit availability  have not impaired our ability to finance our operations  but there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies that could negatively impact us 
the global financial crisis and economic recessions in the us and abroad may also negatively impact our customers and the demand for refined products 
for example  an extension of the credit crisis to our customers could adversely impact their ability to maintain liquidity 
we are monitoring our customers liquidity in order to mitigate any adverse impact on our results of operations 

table of contents american international group aig is the lead underwriter for many of our coverages  but actually underwrites less than one fourth of our aggregate coverage 
the majority of our insurance coverage is underwritten by insurers other than aig and its subsidiaries 
aig s exposure to subprime mortgage securities and recent disruptions in the us financial markets have adversely impacted aig 
aig s commercial insurance subsidiary had funds in excess of loss reserves and continued to be a fully accepted insurance carrier for major brokers at december  however  continued volatility in the us financial markets and the financial condition of aig may adversely impact the financial strength of aig s commercial insurance subsidiaries 
in october  lehman commercial paper inc lehman cpi filed for bankruptcy 
lehman cpi was a previous lender under our credit agreement  with a commitment of million less than of our total credit agreement capacity 
lehman cpi will not participate in any future requests for funding and it is not certain whether another lender will assume its commitment 
while the financial crisis could impact our ability to obtain future borrowings under our credit agreement if other lenders are unable to perform their obligations  we are unaware of any reason to believe this will happen 
results of operations a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented hereafter 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 
our results include the operations of our los angeles refinery and shell and usa gasoline retail stations since acquisition in may summary our net earnings for declined to million per diluted share from million per diluted share in the decline was due primarily to the following substantially lower industry gasoline margins  particularly during the first half of versus the first half of  lower gross refining margins at both our washington and golden eagle refineries reflecting planned turnarounds of several units during the first and second quarters  higher operating expenses primarily reflecting increased utility expenses  a million pre tax charge to write off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely  and the impact of rising crude oil prices on our derivative positions during the first half of the decrease in net earnings during relative to was partially offset by the following a lifo liquidation associated with our working capital management program during resulting in a reduction to costs of sales of million pre tax  refunds totaling million pre tax from the trans alaska pipeline system taps in connection with rulings from the regulatory commission of alaska concerning our protest of intrastate pipeline rates between and  lower stock based and incentive compensation costs of million pre tax  initiatives implemented to improve our capture of available margins and match our yields to market demands including increasing the yield of distillate products  and increasing the utilization of heavy and sour crude oils  utilization of the golden eagle delayed coker  beginning in may  to capture yield improvements and increase our flexibility to utilize advantaged  lower cost crude oil  and improved retail margins 

table of contents net earnings for declined to million per diluted share from million per diluted share in the decline was due primarily to the following substantially lower industry refined product margins on the us west coast during the second half of the year as crude oil prices rose rapidly and product prices increased more gradually  significantly lower gross refining margins at our hawaii refinery  higher operating expenses reflecting increased repairs and maintenance expenses and employee costs  the impact of rising crude oil prices on our non trading derivative positions  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses reflecting higher stock based compensation and employee costs

i we experienced reduced throughput during scheduled turnarounds for the following refineries the golden eagle and washington refineries during  the los angeles  golden eagle  and utah refineries during  and the golden eagle  washington and alaska refineries during compared to overview 
the decrease in operating income of million during was primarily due to lower gross refining margins and increased operating expenses primarily due to higher utility costs 
in addition  the fourth quarter included a million charge to write off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely 
the decrease in operating income was partially offset by a decrease to costs of sales of million during resulting from the liquidation of last in first out lifo inventory quantities acquired at lower per barrel costs 
our gross refining margin per barrel decreased by in to per barrel as compared to per barrel in reflecting significantly lower industry margins for gasoline 
us west coast benchmark gasoline margins were down from an average of per barrel in to an average of per barrel in as a result of rapidly rising crude oil prices during the first half of and weakening product demand 
during the second half of  however  crude oil prices declined primarily due to declining global crude oil demand 
the rapid decline in crude oil prices resulted in slightly improved refining margins during the last six months of versus the prior year as product prices declined more gradually 
weaker industry gasoline margins were partially offset by higher diesel fuel margins in reflecting strong global demand and low inventories 
industry market fundamentals are further described above in industry overview 
industry margins were higher in due to robust market fundamentals during the first half of the year  including strong demand for refined products  low refinery utilization  low products inventories and the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for non road diesel fuel which began in june gross refining margins 
our total gross refining margins declined to billion in from billion in  reflecting lower gross refining margins per barrel in all of our regions except for our mid pacific region 
each of our regions was impacted by lower industry gasoline margins and other regional factors described below 
in our california region  gross refining margins decreased to per barrel in as compared to although gross refining margins declined on a per barrel basis  our total gross refining margins increased year over year as a result of operating the los angeles refinery for a full year in our gross refining margins were negatively impacted during by the turnaround of five major units at our golden 
table of contents eagle refinery from mid march through april 
we estimate that our refining operating income was reduced by approximately million as a result of this turnaround 
in addition  our ability to capture the cost differentials between foreign sourced and local crude oils at our los angeles refinery through the first half of was limited by certain contractual purchase commitments and refinery logistical limitations 
in the second quarter  we opted not to renew the remaining crude oil contracts assumed in the acquisition which has allowed us to process more cost advantaged foreign crude oils 
the decrease in gross refining margins was partially offset as we increased runs of more cost advantaged crude oil in connection with the operation of the delayed coker at the golden eagle refinery beginning in the second quarter 
our gross refining margins in were negatively impacted at our golden eagle refinery due to scheduled turnarounds of the fluid catalytic cracker and hydrocracking units and other unscheduled downtime 
gross refining margins in our pacific northwest region decreased to per barrel in as compared to gasoline industry margins in the region declined by almost from reflecting poor demand 
our gross refining margins were also negatively impacted in due to the turnaround of our fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation units at our washington refinery from late january to mid february 
unplanned boiler outages at the washington refinery in december also negatively impacted gross refining margins 
during the first quarter  we experienced scheduled and unscheduled downtime at our washington refinery 
during the first half of  heavy industry turnaround activity and unscheduled downtime on the us west coast benefited our gross refining margins in the region 
in our mid pacific region  gross refining margins increased to per barrel from per barrel in the increase in our gross refining margins in the region reflects our ability to run more cost advantaged heavy sweet and light sour crude oils in as part of our hawaii improvement initiatives previously discussed 
starting in the first quarter  we began to run more cost advantaged heavy sweet and light sour crude oils reducing our light sweet crude oils as a percent of total throughput to from a year ago 
we also increased our percentage of heavy crude oil to total throughput from in to in in addition  several of our term refined product contracts have lagging pricing provisions based on prior months prices  which benefited our gross refinery margins in the second half of as crude oil prices declined 
gross refining margins were further benefited by our completion of a controls modernization project in the fourth quarter which improves reliability and refining yields and reduces energy costs 
we also completed a new electrical substation during the first quarter resulting in improved reliability 
in our mid continent region  gross refining margins decreased to per barrel in as compared to our gross refining margins in the region were negatively impacted by the scheduled downtime of three units for mechanical repairs at our utah refinery during the third quarter 
further  poor weather during the first quarter reduced our crude oil supplies to the utah refinery and dampened regional product demand 
conversely  strong product demand from the farming sector and unplanned outages at several refineries in the region during the first half of benefited industry margins in the prior year 
the decrease in our gross refining margins was partially offset by the availability of more cost advantaged local light sweet crude oils which lowered our crude oil costs during the second half of due to incremental production and supply of the crude oils in the region  we anticipate continued cost benefits 
our gross refining margins were also impacted by our derivative positions during the rapid increase in crude oil prices during the first half of negatively impacted our derivative positions reducing our gross refining margins by million year over year 
during the second quarter  we closed the majority of our long haul crude oil derivative positions 
refining throughput 
during both and  total refining throughput averaged mbpd 
excluding the los angeles refinery  throughput decreased by mbpd primarily reflecting throughput reductions at our alaska  hawaii and washington refineries due to the weak market environment 
for information related to scheduled downtime for both periods see footnote i of the table above 
refined product sales 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales 
table of contents volumes 
our average refined product sales price increased to per barrel as higher average crude oil prices put upward pressure on product prices 
total refined product sales volumes increased reflecting additional sales volumes from operating our los angeles refinery for a full year in excluding the los angeles refinery  total refined product sales volumes decreased by mbpd reflecting declining demand 
costs of sales and expenses 
our average costs of sales increased to per barrel during  reflecting the significant increase in average crude oil prices during the year 
manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to billion in  compared with billion in  with million of the increase incurred by the los angeles refinery 
the remaining increase of million primarily reflects higher utility costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million as a result of a million charge to write off a receivable discussed above 
compared to overview 
the decrease in operating income of million during was primarily due to reduced gross refining margins per barrel and increased operating expenses and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by increased throughput 
during  total gross refining margin per barrel decreased by from  reflecting significantly lower industry margins on the us west coast during the last six months of us refined product margins during the first six months of remained well above historical levels primarily due to strong product demand  lower industry refinery utilization due to heavy turnaround activity and unplanned outages  low product inventories and the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for non road diesel fuel beginning june  however  during the second half of industry refined product margins on the us west coast fell substantially as rising product prices lagged rapidly rising crude oil prices 
industry margins on the us west coast in the second half of were much stronger compared to the second half of reflecting stronger product demand  lower average product inventories and the introduction of new sulfur requirements for gasoline and diesel fuel 
in addition  during the fourth quarter we experienced record industry margins due to extensive industry turnaround activity and unplanned downtime on the us west coast 
gross refining margins 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased to billion in from billion in  reflecting increased refining throughput as a result of acquiring the los angeles refinery partly offset by lower per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions  except the mid continent region 
other regional factors impacting gross refining margins are described below 
during  gross refining margins in our california and pacific northwest regions declined and  respectively 
factors that negatively impacted our gross refining margins in the california region during included i the scheduled refinery maintenance turnarounds at our golden eagle refinery of the fluid catalytic cracker and hydrocracking units and subsequent extension of the fluid catalytic cracker turnaround during the first quarter due to unanticipated repairs and equipment malfunctions  ii unscheduled downtime at our golden eagle refinery during the third quarter which increased feedstock costs and reduced throughput  and iii contractual purchase commitments and certain refinery logistical limitations at our los angeles refinery which limited our ability to capture the cost differentials between foreign sourced and local crudes 
the pacific northwest region was negatively impacted by unscheduled maintenance of the boiler unit for the fluid catalytic cracker and scheduled maintenance on two hydrotreating units at our washington refinery during the third quarter resulting in reduced operating income of approximately million 
in our mid pacific region  gross refining margins declined during  reflecting the decline in us west coast industry margins during the second half of crude oil costs in the region were impacted as asian sweet crude oils realized higher premiums due to strong asian demand 
at the same time  several of our term product contracts have lagging pricing provisions as discussed above  which delayed our fully passing along the rising crude oil costs 
in addition  an unplanned outage of the hawaii refinery s reformer unit during the fourth quarter negatively impacted results by an estimated million  including million of higher repairs and maintenance expenses 
in our mid continent region  gross refining margins increased per barrel during reflecting strong product demand from the farming sector and unplanned refinery outages at several refineries during the first 
table of contents half of we were also able to take advantage of more discounted local light sweet crudes during the fourth quarter 
our gross refining margins were also impacted by our non trading derivative positions during our derivative positions were negatively impacted by rapidly rising crude oil costs  which reduced our gross refining margins by million year over year 
during and  our derivative positions resulted in a million loss and a million gain  respectively 
refining throughput 
total refining throughput averaged mbpd in compared to mbpd during  primarily reflecting average refining throughput at our los angeles refinery of mbpd see footnote b of the table above for information related to refining throughput at our los angeles refinery 
scheduled downtime during and that negatively impacted refining throughput is described in footnote i of the table above 
we also experienced unscheduled downtime in at our golden eagle  washington and hawaii refineries as described above 
during  we experienced unscheduled downtime at our alaska refinery as a result of the grounding of our time chartered vessel which impacted the supply of feedstocks to the refinery 
refined product sales 
revenues from sales of refined products increased during primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes 
our average refined product sales price increased to per barrel reflecting the increase in crude oil prices 
total refined product sales volumes increased mbpd in  primarily reflecting additional sales volumes from our los angeles refinery 
costs of sales and expenses 
our average costs of sales increased to per barrel during  reflecting the significant increase in crude oil prices during the year 
manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to billion in  compared with million in  with million of the increase incurred by the los angeles refinery 
the remaining increase of million reflects higher repairs and maintenance expenses of million  increased employee costs of million  higher marine charter expenses of million and increased utilities costs of million 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in  compared to million in  reflecting depreciation and amortization of million associated with the los angeles refinery and increased depreciation from our recent investments in capital projects 
loss on asset disposals and impairments decreased by million primarily due to charges of million during relating to the termination of a delayed coker project at our washington refinery

income tax provision the income tax provision amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the fluctuations reflect decreases in earnings before income taxes 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of federal tax audits for the years through while the decrease in our effective income tax rate from to was primarily a result of an increase in the federal tax deduction for domestic manufacturing activities 
capital resources and liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit 
our credit agreement provides for borrowings including letters of credit up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base or the agreement s total capacity 
on december   based on a crude oil alaska north slope price of per barrel  our adjusted borrowing base was approximately million 
our total capacity of billion was increased by million in and can be increased up to a total capacity of billion 
we also increased our separate letter of credit capacity by million to million during we increased our capacities due to the significant increase in crude prices in the first half of we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  million of borrowings under our revolver  and million in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after million in outstanding letters of credit 
we also have three separate letter of credit agreements of which we had million available after million in outstanding letters of credit as of december  during  we reduced inventories by million barrels through our working capital program to improve cash flows from operations 
in  we plan to fund our capital program of million through operating cash flows 
we believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in lehman commercial paper inc lehman cpi was one of the lenders under our credit agreement  representing a commitment of million less than of our total credit agreement capacity 
in october  
table of contents lehman cpi filed for bankruptcy 
lehman cpi will not participate in any future requests for funding and it is not certain whether another lender might assume its commitment 
our total capacity of billion at december  reflects this commitment reduction 
based on the total amounts available under our credit agreement and separate letter of credit agreements and our anticipated utilization  we believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs 
during the fourth quarter  our working capital was negatively impacted by a million charge to write off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers financial condition and the collectability of our receivables  and we have implemented certain enhancements for reviewing  monitoring and responding to these evaluations 
in connection with the receivable write off  we have initiated a lawsuit against the account debtor 
we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in this lawsuit 
taps refunds in  tesoro alaska company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through taps

receivables decreased less than payables as a result of product prices lagging sharply falling crude oil prices 
inventories decreased from year end due in part to our efforts to reduce inventories as described above

b capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest 
operating lease obligations represent our future minimum lease commitments 
operating lease commitments for include lease arrangements with initial terms of less than one year  and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 
c represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for the supply of crude oil feedstocks  with remaining terms ranging from year to years 
prices under these term agreements generally fluctuate with market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices as of december   ranging by crude oil type from per barrel to per barrel  and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil feedstocks under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which are not included in the table above 
d represents primarily long term commitments for the transportation and storage of crude oil and to purchase industrial gases  chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries 
these purchase obligations are based on the contract s minimum volume requirements

environmental and other matters we are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations  including environmental and income tax matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
where required  we have made accruals in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  in order to provide for these matters 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters with certainty 
however  we have made accruals based on our best estimates  subject to future developments 
we believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated financial position  although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material adverse impact on interim or annual results of operations 
tesoro is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications or changes in certain emission sources 
conditions may develop that cause increases or decreases in future expenditures for our various sites  including  but not limited to  our refineries  tank farms  pipelines  retail stations operating and closed locations and refined products terminals  and for compliance with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements 
we cannot currently determine the amounts of such future expenditures 
tesoro is subject to audits by federal  state and local taxing authorities in the normal course of business 
it is possible that tax audits could result in claims against tesoro in excess of recorded liabilities 
we believe  however  that when these matters are resolved  they will not materially affect tesoro s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million income tax benefit from the favorable settlement of federal tax audits for the years through although the income tax liability has been settled  years  and remain open to adjustment pending the settlement of interest 
all tax liabilities resulting from these audits were previously recorded as unrecognized tax benefits in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in accordance with fasb interpretation no

environmental liabilities we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our previously owned properties 
at december  and december   our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled million and million  respectively 
our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties  refining  pipeline and terminal operations and retail stations 
we believe these accruals are adequate  based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions 
these estimated environmental liabilities require judgment to assess and estimate the future costs to remediate 
it is reasonably possible that additional remediation costs will be incurred as more information becomes available related to these environmental matters 
in march  we settled our dispute with a prior owner of our golden eagle refinery concerning soil and groundwater conditions at the refinery 
we received million in settlement proceeds in exchange for assuming responsibility for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august at december  and  our accruals for these environmental liabilities totaled million and million  respectively  which are included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
we cannot presently estimate additional remedial activities that may be required at the golden eagle refinery 
therefore  it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional remediation costs as more information becomes available 
we expect to have valid insurance claims under certain environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to million for 
table of contents liabilities in excess of the settlement proceeds 
amounts recorded for these environmental liabilities have not been reduced by possible insurance recoveries 
we are continuing to investigate environmental conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our golden eagle refinery 
this investigation is driven by an order from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board that names us as well as two previous owners of the golden eagle refinery 
a reserve to investigate these conditions is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
in july  we received a notice of violation nov from the epa for the washington refinery 
epa alleged that prior to our acquisition of the refinery certain modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in violation of the clear air act 
in october  we received a nov from epa concerning the refinery also alleging that prior to our acquisition of the refinery certain other modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in violation of the clean air act 
we have investigated the allegations and we cannot estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the novs 
however  at this time we believe the final resolution of the novs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we believe we have defenses to the allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
a reserve for our response to the novs is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
other matters in the ordinary course of business  we become party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental  regulatory and other matters 
large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable  and some matters may require years for us to resolve 
as a result  we have not established reserves for these matters and the matters described below 
on the basis of existing information  we believe that the resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on february   we received a nov from the epa relating to our compliance with the clean air act and the corresponding regulations concerning the regulation of fuels and fuel additives 
the allegations arise from a compliance review conducted by the epa in for the years through the time of the review in we are investigating the allegations contained in the nov and we cannot estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of this nov 
however  at this time we believe the final resolution of this nov will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  we settled seven of the ten pending cases alleging mtbe contamination in groundwater 
in january  we were served with an additional lawsuit alleging mtbe contamination in groundwater 
we are a defendant  along with other manufacturing  supply and marketing defendants  in all of the cases 
the defendants are being sued for having manufactured mtbe and having manufactured  supplied and distributed gasoline containing mtbe 
the plaintiffs in the four cases  all in california  are municipalities and governmental authorities 
the plaintiffs allege  in part  that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees 
a reserve for the three cases pending on december  was included in accrued liabilities at december  we believe the resolution of the four remaining cases will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position or results of operations 
we believe we have defenses against these claims and intend to vigorously defend them 
in october  we received an nov from the epa concerning our utah refinery alleging certain violations of the clean air act at the refinery beginning in we are investigating the allegations contained in the nov and cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution 
however  we believe the final resolution of this nov will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
environmental capital expenditures epa regulations related to the clean air act require reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline 
in december  a gasoline hydrotreater was commissioned at our utah refinery to satisfy the requirements of 
table of contents the regulations 
we spent million in to complete the project 
our refineries will not require any additional capital spending to meet the low sulfur gasoline standards 
in may  the epa issued a rule regarding the sulfur content of non road diesel fuel 
the requirements to reduce non road diesel sulfur content will become effective in phases through at our north dakota refinery  we expect to spend million in to meet the standards 
we are currently evaluating alternative projects that will satisfy the future requirements under existing regulations at our utah and hawaii refineries 
our golden eagle  los angeles  washington and alaska refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the diesel fuel standards 
in february  the epa issued regulations for the reduction of benzene in gasoline 
we are still evaluating the impact of this standard  however  based on our most recent estimates we expect to spend approximately million to million through to meet the regulations at five of our refineries 
these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
during  we spent million to meet this regulation 
our golden eagle and los angeles refineries will not require capital spending to meet the benzene reduction standards 
during the fourth quarter of  we received approval by the hearing board for the bay area air quality management district to modify our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker at our golden eagle refinery which is designed to lower emissions while also enhancing the refinery s capabilities in terms of crude oil flexibility  reliability  lengthening turnaround cycles and lowering maintenance costs 
we negotiated the terms and conditions of the second conditional abatement order with the district in response to the january mechanical failure of the fluid coker boiler at the golden eagle refinery 
the coker became fully operational during the second quarter 
we spent million from inception of the project  million of which was spent in regulations issued by california s south coast air quality management district the district require the emission of nitrogen oxides to be reduced through at our los angeles refinery 
we plan to meet this requirement by replacing less efficient power cogeneration units and steam boilers with more efficient equipment 
the district has determined that it cannot issue a permit for this replacement project until it revises its regulation and  in fact  has implemented a temporary ban on a broad class of air permits 
we are evaluating other alternatives to meet the reduction requirements during the short term pending the completion of the equipment replacement project 
during  we spent million and we expect to spend an additional million to million beginning in for the equipment replacement and short term alternative projects 
in  we expect to spend approximately million for design and procurement for the equipment replacement and to evaluate the short term alternative projects 
other projects at our los angeles refinery include replacing underground pipelines with above ground pipelines as required by an order from the california regional water quality control board 
we spent million in and expect to spend an additional million to million through to complete the project 
in  we also installed new flare gas recovery compressors designed to meet flaring requirements of the south coast air quality management district 
the new compressors were commissioned in december we spent million in to install the flare gas recovery compressors 
we are installing facilities at our golden eagle and north dakota refineries to eliminate the use of atmospheric blowdown towers by rerouting these emergency relief systems 
we believe that this plan will provide safer operating conditions for our employees and will address environmental regulatory issues related to monitoring potential air emissions from components connected to the blowdown towers 
we spent million in and expect to spend an additional million through our other refineries do not have emergency relief systems routed to atmospheric blowdown towers 
we will spend additional capital at the golden eagle refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery through during  we spent million and expect to spend an additional million through we are also evaluating alternative projects for our wharves at the golden eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the state of california in february these project alternatives could cost between million and million between and the timing of these projects is subject to negotiations with the appropriate regulatory agency 

table of contents in connection with our acquisition of our north dakota and utah refineries  tesoro assumed the seller s obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the united states  bp exploration and oil co 
bp  amoco oil company and atlantic richfield company 
bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the owner of these refineries  tesoro is required to address issues to reduce air emissions 
based upon our current plans  we spent million in and expect to spend an additional million through to comply with this consent decree 
we also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree 
california air resources board regulations require the installation of enhanced vapor recovery and in station diagnostic systems at all california gasoline retail stations by april the enhanced vapor recovery systems control and contain gasoline vapor emissions during motor vehicle fueling 
we spent million during and expect to spend an additional million in to satisfy the requirements of these regulations 
in december  the us congress passed the energy independence and security act  which  among other things  modified the industry requirements for the renewable fuel standard rfs 
this standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels including ethanol and biodiesel sold or introduced in the us to be billion gallons in rising to billion gallons by both requirements could reduce demand growth for petroleum products in the future 
in the near term  the rfs presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for both the ethanol and refining and marketing industries and may require additional expenditures by us to accommodate increased ethanol use 
in june  the california air resources board proposed amendments to the requirements for gasoline in the state of california that decreases the allowable sulfur levels to parts per million and allows for additional ethanol to be blended into gasoline 
the requirements begin december  but may be postponed by individual companies until december  through the use of the alternative emission reduction plan which allows for the acquisition of emissions offsets from sources not directly related to petroleum fuel use 
we expect both of our california refineries to be in compliance with the regulation by the deadline and expect to spend approximately million through to meet the requirements 
the cost estimates for the environmental projects described above are subject to further review and analysis and include estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs 
pension funding for all eligible employees  we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan with benefits based on years of service and compensation

claims against third parties in  tesoro alaska company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the trans alaska pipeline system taps 
our protest asserted that the taps intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced 
the regulatory commission of alaska rca considered our protest of the intrastate rates for the years through the rca set just and reasonable final rates for the years through  and held that we were entitled to receive refunds  including interest 
in accordance with the ruling  in march we received a refund from taps of million  net of contingent legal fees 
the million refund is included as other income in our statement of consolidated operations 

table of contents in  the rca rejected the taps carriers proposed intrastate rate increases for and maintained the rate of to the valdez marine terminal 
the rate decrease has been in effect since june in june  the alaska supreme court upheld the rate for the years through we were awarded refunds in june and july including interest totaling million  net of contingent legal fees  for the period through june the rates paid from mid june through june were also upheld 
the million refund is included as other income in our statement of consolidated operations 
in january of  tesoro alaska company intervened in a protest before the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  of the taps carriers interstate rates for and in july  the taps carriers filed a proceeding at the ferc seeking to have the ferc assume jurisdiction under section of the interstate commerce act and set future rates for intrastate transportation on taps 
we filed a protest in that proceeding  which was consolidated with the other ferc proceeding seeking to set just and reasonable interstate rates on taps for and in june  the ferc issued a final order in this consolidated ferc proceeding that lowered those interstate rates and refused to revise the current intrastate rates 
the taps carriers have sought rehearing and appealed the ferc order 
we cannot give assurances of whether they will ultimately prevail in any such rehearing or appeal 
however  should the taps carriers prevail  the result will not have a material impact on our operations or financial results in future reporting periods but could affect our future costs in the ordinary course of business
