overview widepoint corporation widepoint or the company is a technology based provider of product and services to both the government sector and commercial markets 
widepoint was incorporated in delaware on may  we have grown through the merger of highly specialized regional it consulting companies 
our expertise lies in three business segments 
the three segments offer unique solutions in identity management services utilizing certificate based security solutions  wireless telecommunication expense management systems  and other associated it consulting services and products in which we provide specific subject matter expertise in it architecture and planning  software implementation services  it outsourcing  and forensic informatics 
for additional information related to our three business segments  see note to our financial statements in this form k 
widepoint has three material operational entities  operational research consultants  inc orc  isys  llc isys  which we acquired in january  and widepoint il  inc  operated together with protexx acquisition corp  doing business as protexx  which we acquired in july orc specializes in it integration and secure authentication processes and software  and providing services to the us government 
orc has been at the forefront of implementing public key infrastructure pki technologies 
pki technology uses a class of algorithms in which a user can receive two electronic keys  consisting of a public key and a private key  to encrypt any information and or communication being transmitted to or from the user within a computer network and between different computer networks 
pki technology is rapidly becoming the technology of choice to enable security services within and between different computer systems utilized by various agencies and departments of the us government 
isys specializes in mobile telecommunications expense management services  forensic informatics  and information assurance services  predominantly to various agencies and departments of the us government 
protexx  which was in the development stage company when we acquired it  specializes in identity assurance  and mobile and wireless data protection products and services 

table of contents we intend to continue to market and sell our technical capabilities into the governmental and commercial marketplace 
further  we are continuing to actively search out new synergistic acquisitions that we believe may further enhance our present base of business and service offerings  which has already been augmented by our acquisitions of orc and isys  our asset purchase of protexx  and our internal growth initiatives 
with the addition of the customer base and the increase in revenues attributable to our isys acquisition  widepoint s opportunity to leverage and expand further into the federal marketplace has improved substantially 
isys s past client successes  top security clearances for their personnel  and additional breadth of management talent have expanded the company s reach into markets that previously were not fully accessible to widepoint 
widepoint intends to continue to leverage the synergies between its newly acquired operating subsidiary  and cross sell its technical capabilities into each separate marketplace serviced by our respective subsidiaries 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  due to revenues earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of the pass through of other direct costs  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts  the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of our acquisitions  which predominantly operate in the us federal marketplace  we rely upon a larger portion of our revenues from the federal government directly or as a subcontractor 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date  our clients may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
such suspensions may cause us to realize lower revenues in the fourth calendar quarter and or first quarter of the government s fiscal year 
further  a change in senior government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases the services that we offer 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
these comparisons are not indicators of future performance and no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a possible material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents in addition  most of widepoint s current costs consist primarily of the salaries and benefits paid to widepoint s technical  marketing and administrative personnel as well as vendor related costs in connection with our mobile telecom managed services 
as a result of our plan to expand widepoint s operations through a combination of internal growth initiatives and merger and acquisition opportunities  widepoint expects such costs to increase 
widepoint s profitability also depends upon both the volume of services performed and the company s ability to manage costs 
as a significant portion of the company s cost is labor related  widepoint must effectively manage these costs to achieve and grow its profitability 
the company must also manage our airtime plans and other vendor related offerings under our mobile telecom managed services provided to our customers as they also represent a significant portion of our costs 
to date  the company has attempted to maximize its operating margins through efficiencies achieved by the use of its proprietary methodologies  and by offsetting increases in consultant salaries with increases in consultant fees received from its clients 
the uncertainties relating to the ability to achieve and maintain profitability  obtain additional funding to partially fund the company s growth strategy and provide the necessary investment to continue to upgrade its management reporting systems to meet the continuing demands of the present regulatory changes affect the comparability of the information reflected in the financial information presented above 
our staff consists of business process and computer specialists who help our government and civilian customers augment and expand their resident technologic skills and competencies  drive technical innovation  and help develop and maintain a competitive edge in today s rapidly changing technological environment in business 
our organization emphasizes an intense commitment to our people  our customers  and the quality of our solutions offerings 
as a services organization  our customers are our primary focus 
the company s revenues for the year ending december  increased by approximately from approximately million in to approximately million in the increase in revenues during as compared to was primarily a result of our acquisition of isys and the addition of our wireless telecommunication expense management systems segment 
while we anticipate revenue gains for our calendar year at each of our three business segments  the realization of those gains may be subject to timing delays in project implementation phases that may be outside the control of the company  and there can be no assurance that our revenues will increase in critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
widepoint believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonably based upon information available to it at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  the company s financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that widepoint believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  intangibles  and accounting for income taxes 

table of contents in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with its audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
revenue recognition a portion of the company s revenues are derived from cost plus  or time and materials contracts 
under cost plus contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred and include an estimate of applicable fees earned 
for time and material contracts  revenues are computed by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
in the event of a termination of a contract  all billed and unbilled amounts associated with those task orders where work has been performed would be billed and collected 
the termination provisions of the contract would be accounted for at the time of termination 
any deferred and or amortization cost would either be billed or expensed depending upon the termination provisions of the contract 
further  the company has had no material history of losses nor has it identified any material specific risk of loss at december  or december  due to termination provisions and thus has not recorded provisions for such events 
additionally  revenues are derived from the delivery of non customized software 
in such cases revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists generally a purchase order has been received or contract signed  delivery has occurred  the charge for the software is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenue from our mobile telecom expense management services mtems is recognized upon delivery of services as they are rendered 
arrangements with customers on mtems related contracts are recognized ratably over a period of performance 
revenue from the sale of pki credentials is recognized when delivery occurs 
arrangements with customers on pki related contracts may involve multiple deliverable elements 
in these cases  the company applies the principles prescribed in emerging issues task force abstract eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of the nature of the contract or product sold  the terms of each specific transaction  the relative fair values of the elements required by eitf  any contingencies that may be present  its historical experience with like transactions or with like products  the creditworthiness of the customer  and other current market and economic conditions 

table of contents should the sale of product or software involve an arrangement with multiple elements for example  the sale of pki credential seats along with the sale of maintenance  hosting and support to be delivered over the contract period  the company allocates revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the company defers revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizes the remaining amount at the time of the delivery of the product or when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
allowance for doubtful accounts widepoint determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligations  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based on these factors and provide allowances for these receivables when collections become doubtful 
provisions are made based on specific review of all significant outstanding balances 
because of the company s history of minimal credit losses and the nature of the company s customers at the time  no allowance for doubtful accounts was believed necessary at december  or at december  goodwill goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets acquired 
the company has adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards require the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  set forth the accounting for the initial recognition of acquired intangible assets and goodwill and describe the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill subsequent to initial recognition 
under the provisions of these standards  goodwill is not subject to amortization and annual review is required for impairment 
the impairment test under sfas no 
is based on a two step process involving i comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value and ii comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the company s annual impairment testing date is december goodwill is a significant item on the company s balance sheet and represents approximately of our total assets as of december  goodwill is identified on the face of the balance sheet 
intangibles purchase accounting intangibles the company recognizes an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights  or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
the application of purchase accounting to a business acquisition requires that the company identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each 

table of contents the intangibles recognized in the acquisition are amortized over the company s estimate of their useful lives 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
internally developed intangibles the company recognizes an internally developed intangible whenever the costs of the internally generated intangible are beyond the research and development stage and is provable for which the costs of such efforts are specifically identifiable  has a determinate life  and is not inherent in a continuing business and is not related to a reporting entity as a whole 
the intangibles recognized as internally developed are amortized over the company s estimate of their useful lives 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible subject to amortization is not recoverable from the expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company reviews its long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
as of december   the company is not aware of any known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or the assumptions the company has used to value long lived assets 
long lived assets are a significant item on the company s balance sheet and represent approximately of our total assets 
any impairment as a result of the estimate utilizing undiscounted net cash flows to determine the assumed value of long lived assets could have a significant impact on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
long lived assets are identified on the face of the balance sheet as intangibles 
amortization of intangibles is identified on the face of the statement of operations within cost of sales 
specific intangibles materially arose as a result of the company s acquisitions of orc  isys  llc  and the assets purchase of protexx  inc the company allocated approximately   net book value at december  to customer list and relationships and approximately  to goodwill for its acquisition of orc 
the company allocated approximately   net book value at december  to customer relationships  internally generated software and the isys trade name and approximately  to goodwill for its acquisition of isys  llc 
the company allocated approximately  approximately  net book value at december  to internally generated software and systems as a result of the asset purchase of protexx  inc the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of the accounting estimates relating to the purchase accounting for the orc  isys llc  and protexx acquisitions  the amortization period of the acquired intangibles and the lack of impairment of the assets  and the md a disclosure regarding those estimates  with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
also  the company engaged a valuation firm to perform an independent analysis to provide a qualified opinion on the company s methodology and calculations in determining the related intangibles valuations associated with the purchase accounting for the orc acquisition and engaged a valuation firm to perform an independent analysis to provide a qualified opinion on the related intangibles valuations and purchase price allocations associated with the purchase accounting for the isys  llc acquisition 

table of contents accounting for income taxes widepoint accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts  and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company has incurred historical net operating losses  or nols  for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  no federal income tax provision has been recorded to date and there are no taxes payable 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the level of historical losses that may limit utilization of nol carry forwards in future periods  management is unable to predict whether these net deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to expiration 
the unused nol carry forwards expire in years through as such  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
widepoint believes that its estimates are reasonable  given the lack of historical earnings and the fact that there may be significant limitations placed on the use of the nol carryforwards 
there is  however  a significant possibility that the company will have sufficient income in the future to utilize substantial portions of the deferred tax assets 
no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is described above 
such a change in the estimate reflected in the historical income tax provisions could have a material effect on the income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made

results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  an increase of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was materially attributable to our acquisition of isys 
isys provided approximately million of our million in revenues for the year ended december  prior to the acquisition of isys in january  isys had revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  we anticipate further growth of our isys subsidiary in fiscal year as it continues to experience adoption of its mobile telecom services by us federal agencies under the general services administrations gsa federal strategic sourcing initiative fssi contract vehicle for mobile telecom services 
we have been awarded the first two contracts under this contract vehicle during and we are actively marketing our services under this contract vehicle to all us federal agencies and departments 
we believe we are competitively positioned to win additional awards under this contract vehicle in fiscal year our mobile telecom managed services segment experienced revenue growth of approximately with revenues increasing approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  prior to our acquisition in january  to approximately million for the year ended december   as a result of continuing adoption of the federal government s gsa fssi contract vehicle award along with the expansion of our current customer base 
in the long term we anticipate our mobile telecom managed services segment should continue to expand as we witness further adoption by the us federal agencies and departments 
our pki credentialing and managed services segment experienced revenue growth of approximately with revenues increasing approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december   to approximately million for the year ended december   as a result of the adoption of the federal government s mandate under hspd and the continuing adoption of several us federally sponsored programs currently migrating from various pilot programs and or programs that are expanding their deployment as a result of continued adoption by the department of defense  the transportation security administration and other us agencies and departments 
in the long term we anticipate that our pki credentialing and managed services sales should continue to increase as we witness continued adoption of these programs and the launch of various other initiatives 
in the short term we do anticipate a greater variability in revenue growth as we either await contract awards that have been delayed or as certain pilot programs expand to fully implemented programs in support of the hspd initiative 

table of contents our consulting services segment experienced increased revenues of approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was substantially the result of our acquisition of isys and the inclusion of their consulting services group into this segment  partially offset by reductions in our commercial consulting group revenues as a result of the negative economic conditions 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december   was approximately million  or of revenues  an increase of approximately million above cost of sales of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase in cost of sales was substantially attributable to higher revenues  combined with isys service offering that includes an option that provides for the payments of carrier charges on behalf of some of the customer base 
these charges are embedded into the service fees associated with the cost of providing some of our mobile telecom offerings to certain customers 
we do not separately measure our profit margins for contracts with this feature 
depreciation and amortization applied to cost of sales also increased approximately  from  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was substantially a result of the addition of intangible amortization costs associated with our purchase accounting valuation of our isys intangibles 
we believe that as our percentage of business from our higher margin services expands in relationship to our lower margin services that our overall cost of sales as a percentage may decrease in the future 
the cost elements related to consultant salaries  benefits and expenses at all of our subsidiaries are substantially similar 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december   was approximately million  or of revenues  an increase of million as compared to gross profit of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of revenues  as compared to approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenditures for new personnel and tools as we increased our efforts to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure as part of our strategy to further increase our presence into the federal marketplace  which was partially offset by reductions in sales and marketing personnel within our commercial marketplace 
as we expand our sales and marketing efforts these costs may increase 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  substantially all of the increase was attributable to the addition of general and administrative costs added from the acquisition of isys in january and the recognition of higher employee stock options expense of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for year ended december   was approximately  or less than of revenues  an increase of approximately  as compared to approximately  of such expenses  or less than of revenues  recorded by the company for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expenses for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to the increased pool of depreciable assets 
interest income expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income in was primarily attributable to greater amounts of available cash and other securities in interest bearing accounts 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  as compared to  of interest expense for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense in was primarily attributable to greater expenses associated with the debt instruments issued by the company in connection with the acquisition of isys 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to no income taxes for the year ended december  the company incurred a deferred income tax expense of approximately  for the year ended december   as a result of the recognition of a deferred tax liability attributable to the differences in our treatment of the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes versus book purposes as it relates to our acquisition of isys in january because the goodwill is not amortized for book purposes but is for tax purposes and goodwill is considered a permanent asset and not a temporary asset  the related deferred tax liability cannot be reversed until some indeterminate future period when the goodwill either becomes impaired  and or is disposed of 
the deferred tax liability can be offset by future taxable earnings and the deferred tax expense is a non cash expense 
sfas no 
requires the expected timing of future reversals of deferred tax liabilities to be taken into account when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets 
therefore  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to the goodwill is not to be considered a source of future taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 
because the company has a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred income tax asset  the deferred income liability associated with the tax deductible goodwill has been recorded and not offset against existing deferred income tax assets 
net loss 
as a result of the above  the net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million  an increase of million  as compared to the net loss of approximately million for the year ended december

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company has  since inception  financed its operations and capital expenditures through the sale of preferred and common stock  seller notes  convertible notes  convertible exchangeable debentures  senior secured loans and the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants related to a convertible exchangeable debenture 
during and  operations were primarily financed with working capital  senior debt  issuance of common stock  and stock option and warrant exercises 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately  as compared to cash used by operating activities of approximately  for the year ended december  the increase in cash balances available for operating activities for the year ended december   was primarily a result of higher collections of accounts receivable that we acquired in our acquisition of isys as well as higher overall collections of accounts receivable in general and increases in our deferred revenues also primarily attributable to our acquisition of isys 
from the date of the acquisition  isys has decreased its accounts receivable and produced cash from operations of approximately  this was partially offset by a decrease in vendor payables and accrued expenses of  additionally  deferred revenue for isys produced approximately million in additional cash from operations 
cash provided by investing and financing activities also improved materially as a result from two capital raises in april and may of that raised approximately million 
capital expenditures in property and equipment were approximately  excluding any capital leases for the year ended december   as compared to capital expenditures in property and equipment of approximately  excluding capital leases for the year ended december  substantially all of the increases in assets and liabilities in the company s balance sheet were due to our acquisition of isys and capital raises during the company requires substantial working capital to fund the future growth of its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable  sales and marketing efforts  and capital expenditures 
there are currently no material commitments for capital expenditures but that could change with the addition of material contract awards 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending for new product and service development  technological changes and market acceptance of the company s services 
widepoint believes that its current cash position is sufficient to meet capital expenditure and working capital requirements through however  the growth and technological change of the market make it difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
over the longer term  the company must successfully execute its plans to increase revenue and income streams that will generate significant positive cash flows if it is to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources 
additionally  a major expansion might require external financing that could include additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  for future acquisitions and or growth initiatives 

table of contents as of december   the company had net working capital of approximately million 
widepoint s primary source of liquidity consists of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable 
current liabilities include approximately million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and approximately million in a related party note payable 
the company s business environment is characterized by rapid technological change  experiencing times of high growth and contraction  and is influenced by material events such as mergers and acquisitions that can substantially change the company s performance and outlook
