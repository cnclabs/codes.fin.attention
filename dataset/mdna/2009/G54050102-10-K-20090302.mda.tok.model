for the years ended december    and  the company s consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments year ended december financial advisory asset management corporate total business environment the global financial markets have experienced extraordinary disruption and volatility during and therefore challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of the year 
contraction in worldwide credit markets due in part to sub prime lending issues  volatile currency and commodity markets  major write downs within the financial sector and volatile oil prices have raised significant uncertainty about the state of the us and global economies 
these economic and market conditions have negatively affected our financial performance in both the financial advisory and asset management businesses  particularly in the second half of  and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance in the deterioration of the equity and credit markets has also negatively impacted our corporate portfolio of debt securities and investments that are used to seed new asset management products 
lazard operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for lazard s management to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can lazard assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on its business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see the section entitled risk factors in this form k 
furthermore  net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory while m a activity for the year ended december  decreased substantially versus the corresponding prior year for both global and trans atlantic completed transactions and announced transactions  activity in financial restructuring during the year increased significantly due to an increasing amount of corporate debt defaults  particularly in the second half of the year 
total corporate debt defaults in  according to 
table of contents moody s investors service  inc  amounted to billion  as compared to the billion recorded in  principally due to the bankruptcy filings of lehman brothers  washington mutual  tribune company  gmac and residential capital  among others  in the second half of moody s is expecting further increases in the default rates in the following table sets forth industry statistics regarding the change in the volume of m a transactions from to year ended december  incr decr in billions completed m a transactions global trans atlantic announced m a transactions global trans atlantic source thomson financial as of january  while overall m a industry statistics regarding the number and size of announced transactions declined in and the industry outlook for remains challenging  we believe that even in the current environment we are relatively well positioned  due to the expertise and insights of our bankers  the investments we have made in our business and the diversity of our products 
nevertheless  we expect to be a challenging year 
generally  during periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions  the volume and value of m a transactions may decrease  thereby reducing the demand for our advisory services and increasing competition among financial services companies seeking such engagements 
we expect that our financial restructuring practice should benefit over the next several years from the increase in the level of corporate defaults  as well as from advising companies during this period of volatility on matters relating to debt and financing restructuring and other on and off balance sheet assignments 
our financial restructuring assignments normally are executed over a six to eighteen month period 
asset management as shown in the table below  major global market indices at december  decreased significantly as compared to such indices at december   principally as a result of the significant deterioration in the global equity markets 
percentage change december  vs 
msci world index cac dax ftse topix msci emerging market dow jones industrial average nasdaq s p because the fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of assets under management aum  market downturns or volatility in foreign currencies that reduce the level of our aum reduce the revenues we receive from our asset management business 
market 
table of contents depreciation reflected in the changes in lazard s aum during the year ended december  generally corresponded to the changes in global market indices 
during  our asset management business was adversely impacted by a reduction in our aum and may be impacted further should there be continued or further credit market contractions or a sustained market downturn 
financial statement overview net revenue the majority of lazard s financial advisory net revenue is earned from the successful completion of m a transactions  strategic advisory matters  restructuring and capital structure advisory services  capital raising and similar transactions 
the main driver of financial advisory net revenue is overall m a activity  the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities  particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which lazard focuses 
in some client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction 
in addition  lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients  with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction 
lazard s financial advisory segment also earns revenue from public and private securities offerings in the form of referral fees for referring opportunities to lfcm holdings for underwriting and distribution of securities 
the referral fees received from lfcm holdings are generally one half of the revenue recorded by lfcm holdings in respect of such activities 
significant fluctuations in financial advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year 
these fluctuations arise because a significant portion of financial advisory net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  financial restructuring or capital raising activity  the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to lazard s control 
lazard s asset management segment principally includes lam  lazard freres gestion sas lfg and fpg 
asset management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to institutional and private clients 
the main driver of asset management net revenue is the level of aum  which is influenced by lazard s investment performance  its ability to successfully attract and retain assets  the broader performance of the global equity markets and  to a lesser extent  fixed income markets 
as a result  fluctuations in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on asset management net revenue and operating income 
asset management fees are generally based on the level of aum measured as of the end of a quarter or month  and an increase or reduction in aum at such dates  due to market price fluctuations  currency fluctuations  net client asset flows or otherwise  will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees 
the majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of days or less 
institutional and individual clients  and firms with which we have strategic alliances  can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of aum or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
in addition  as lazard s aum include significant assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of lazard s aum 
fees vary with the type of assets managed  with higher fees earned on equity assets  alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity investments  and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products 
the company earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds 
incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks 
incentive fees on private equity funds also may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits from investments exceed a specified threshold 
these incentive fees are paid at the end of the measurement period  and those fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the funds in any year are applied against certain future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
incentive fees 
table of contents earned on our private equity funds are generally not recorded until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
for most of our alternative investment strategies  the determination date is at year end unless an account terminates during the year  and therefore such incentive fees are recorded in the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year 
corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of net interest income  including amounts earned at lfb  and investment gains and losses on debt securities at lfb  lam managed equity funds and principal investments in equities and alternative investment funds managed by lazard alternative investments holdings llc lai  a subsidiary of lfcm holdings  and fpg 
interest expense is also included in corporate net revenue 
corporate net revenue can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of investments classified as trading  and with respect to available for sale  when realized  or when a decline is determined to be other than temporary  as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash  investments and indebtedness

operating expenses the majority of lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for employees and managing directors

there can be no guarantee that this target ratio will continue to be achieved or that our policy may not change in the future  including to adapt to changes in the economic environment  or that a change may not be necessitated by lower operating revenues or to fund a major expansion 
increased competition for senior professionals  continued turmoil and volatility in the financial markets generally or other factors could prevent us from continuing to maintain this target ratio

provision for income taxes lazard group primarily operates in the us as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes

consolidated results of operations lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of our non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates

table of contents net revenue trends in financial advisory for m a and strategic advisory and financial restructuring are generally correlated to the volume of completed industry wide m a transactions and restructurings occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults  respectively 
however  deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for instance  our results can diverge from industry wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry wide m a activity in a particular market where lazard has significant market share  or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger sized transactions  and where we are involved in significant non public assignments 
certain lazard client statistics and global industry statistics are set forth below year ended december  lazard statistics number of clients total with fees greater than million percentage of total financial advisory revenue from top clients a number of m a transactions completed greater than billion b a there were no individual clients that constituted more than of our financial advisory segment net revenue in the years ended december   or b source thomson financial as of january  the geographical distribution of financial advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms 
the offices that generate financial advisory net revenue are located in the us  europe principally in the uk  france  italy  spain and germany and the rest of the world principally in australia  which  for the and periods  includes the impact of the acquisition of cwc 
year ended december  united states europe rest of world total the changes in the distribution of geographical revenues reflected in the above chart demonstrates that our revenue can fluctuate from year to year due to the number  size and timing of closings of completed transactions  as well as seasonality and other factors  such as regional acquisitions 
as such  the geographical distribution of revenues in any particular year may not be indicative of future results 
the company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience  and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on m a  strategic advisory matters and financial restructuring transactions  depending on clients needs 
this flexibility allows lazard to better match its professionals with the counter cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings 
while lazard measures revenue by practice area  lazard does not separately measure the separate costs or profitability of m a services as compared to financial restructuring services 
accordingly  lazard measures performance in its financial advisory segment based on overall segment net revenue and operating income margins 

table of contents financial advisory results of operations year ended december  versus december  in  financial advisory net revenue decreased million  or  as compared to  with m a and strategic advisory revenue decreasing million  or  and financial restructuring revenue decreasing million  or  while corporate finance and other net revenue decreasing million  or 
the decrease in m a and strategic advisory revenue in was principally due to the adverse economic and market conditions described above  and resulted in lower average fees per transaction and the result of a lower number of m a transactions completed greater than billion which typically generate significant fees 
our major clients  which in the aggregate represented of our m a and strategic advisory revenue for the year  included app pharmaceuticals  bear stearns  gaz de france  inbev  international paper  penn national gaming  resolution life  royal bank of scotland  trane and zinefix 
we anticipate that this lower level of m a activity experienced in late may continue into financial restructuring revenue is derived from various activities including bankruptcy assignments  global debt and financing restructurings and advice on complex on and off balance sheet assignments  such as retiree health care obligations 
financial restructuring revenue for ended slightly lower than  however  strong restructuring revenue was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of increased financial restructuring activity

table of contents corporate results of operations year ended december  versus december  net interest expense in the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared to lower interest income was the principal contributing factor to the decline  due to lower average cash balances and a lower interest rate environment 
average cash decreased as a result of the share repurchases of lazard ltd s class a common stock as well as the repurchase of a portion of the company s outstanding and senior notes 
interest expense increased principally as a result of the june  issuance of the aforementioned senior notes  partially offset by the reduction in interest expense related to the company s may  purchase of million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes in connection with the remarketing of such notes and by the repayment of certain senior and subordinated notes in june  other revenue declined million in the year ended december   as compared to  due to the extraordinary disruption and volatility in the equity and credit markets during which adversely impacted investment income 
the decline in other revenue as compared to reflects a million decrease in investment income due to losses and markdowns in the first quarter of of our bank s corporate debt portfolio held as an integral part of its asset liability management program  net unrealized losses in the company s investment in corporate equities to seed new asset management products  and a million write down of private equity investments primarily in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a million gain from the repurchase of a portion of the company s senior notes and million in gains from foreign currency transactions

operating expenses for increased by million compared to  including the million non compensation charge relating to the lam merger in the third quarter of  and increases in other operating expenses in of million  or  as compared to the increase in operating expenses in was principally due to a provision of million for losses from counterparty defaults primarily relating to the bankruptcy of one of our prime brokers and in professional fees for legal expenses related to various corporate activities during decreases in compensation and benefits resulting from lower operating revenue were offset by increases in various other expense categories 
year ended december  versus december  net interest expense in was slightly lower than during  interest income increased from higher average cash balances  principally as a result of the proceeds from the december  primary public offering of class a common stock and the june  issuance of million principal amount of senior notes  which was offset by incremental interest expense related to the aforementioned senior notes issuance 
other revenue declined million  or  in as compared to  principally due to lower investment income of million  principally the result of the widening of credit spreads due to sub prime concerns in the debt markets and volatility in the equity markets during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in mark downs in our bank s portfolio of corporate debt securities and other temporary corporate investments in equities  partially offset by increases in foreign currency transaction gains 
in addition  the company recorded million of unrealized gains on private equity investments and a million gain in connection with its share in the net proceeds related to the sale of a portion of lfcm holdings ownership interest in pg c in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  while included a million gain recognized as a result of the termination of the strategic alliance with intesa in operating expenses in increased million  or  as compared to due primarily to an increase in the provision pursuant to the tax receivable agreement with lfcm holdings of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and  to a lesser extent  increased compensation  as a result of higher consolidated operating revenue and amortization of an increased amount of rsus in 
table of contents cash flows the company s cash flows are influenced by the timing of the receipt of financial advisory and asset management fees  the timing of distributions to shareholders and payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees 
m a  strategic advisory and asset management fees are generally collected within days of billing  while restructuring fee collections may extend beyond days  particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court ordered holdbacks 
fees from our private fund advisory activities are generally collected over a four year period from billing and typically include an interest component 
lazard group traditionally pays a significant portion of its incentive compensation during the first four months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results

included within the receivables net caption on the statements of cash flows are amounts related to lfb s short term inter bank deposits  which represent substantially all of the separately identified amount recorded as receivables net banks on the company s statements of financial condition 
the level of these inter bank deposits is primarily driven by the level of lfb customer related interest bearing time and demand deposits and short term inter bank deposits held at lfb  which can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
as the amount of deposits change  there is generally a corresponding  but indirect  impact on the level of short term inter bank deposits

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities  financing agreements and equity offerings 
operating activities net revenue  operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between quarters 
in the case of financial advisory  fee receipts are principally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions  the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to lazard s control 
in the case of asset management  incentive fees earned on aum are generally not earned until the end of the applicable measurement period  which is generally the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year  with the respective receivable collected in the first quarter of the following year 
liquidity is significantly impacted by incentive compensation payments  a significant portion of which historically have been made during the first four months of the year 
as a consequence  cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year 
we also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of our managing directors  which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments 
we expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue 
in addition  a portion of the february  incentive compensation awards contains a deferred cash component  which is payable over the four year period ending february   subject to the employee meeting applicable vesting requirements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of lazard s non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates 
adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members stockholders equity deficiency 
foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non functional currencies are included on the consolidated statements of operations 
we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including cash levels  credit lines  principal investment commitments  interest and principal payments on debt  capital expenditures and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements 
at december   lazard had approximately billion of cash and liquid securities  including million of temporary seed investments in marketable equity securities and public and private asset management funds 
we maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements 
as of december   lazard had approximately million in unused lines of credit available to it  including million of unused lines of credit available to lfb 
financing over the past several years  lazard has entered into several financing agreements designed to strengthen both its capital base and liquidity

we believe that our cash flows from operating activities  along with the use of our credit lines as needed  should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next months and beyond 
also  we intend to maintain lines of credit that can be utilized should the need arise 
these credit lines include a million senior revolving credit facility with a group of lenders that expires in may  the credit facility 
as long as the lenders commitments remain in effect  any loan pursuant to the credit facility remains outstanding and unpaid or any other amount is owing to the lending bank group  the credit facility includes financial condition covenants that require that lazard group not permit i its consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility for the month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than to or ii its consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility for the month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than to 
for the month period then ended  lazard group was in compliance with such ratios  with its consolidated leverage ratio being to and its consolidated interest coverage ratio being to 
notwithstanding such compliance  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of december  in addition  the credit facility  indenture and supplemental indentures relating to lazard group s senior notes  as well as its amended million subordinated convertible note  contain certain other covenants none of which relate to financial condition  events of default and other customary provisions 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of these provisions

effect of inflation we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect certain of our other expenses  such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing aum  net revenue or otherwise 
see risk factors other business risks difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including by reducing the volume of transactions involving our financial advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our asset management business  which  in each case  could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of lazard s consolidated financial 
table of contents statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  lazard evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  compensation liabilities  income taxes  investing activities and goodwill 
lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
lazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition lazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing financial advisory and asset management services to clients 
lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  the agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
the company also earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including alternative investment funds such as hedge funds  private equity funds and traditional investment strategies 
incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks 
incentive fees on private equity funds also may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits from investments exceed a specified threshold 
these incentive fees are recorded when realized and are paid at the end of the measurement period 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carry forward provisions in which losses incurred by the funds in any year are applied against certain future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
the company records incentive fees at the end of the relevant performance measurement period  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
the performance fee measurement period is generally an annual period  unless an account terminates during the year 
these incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
if  in lazard s judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our fee and customer receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on management s analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired  which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced 
with respect to fees receivable from financial advisory activities  such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding days from the date of invoice 
however  some financial advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years as is the case for our private fund advisory fees following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings 
in such cases  receivables are deemed past due when payment is not received by the agreed upon contractual date or the court approval date  respectively 
financial advisory fee receivables past due in excess of days are fully provided for unless there is evidence that the balance is collectible 
asset management fees are deemed past due and fully provided for when such receivables are outstanding months after the invoice date 
notwithstanding our policy for receivables past due  we specifically reserve against exposures relating to financial advisory and asset management fees where we determine receivables are impaired 

table of contents at december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  of receivables past due  and its allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  lazard is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process requires lazard to estimate its actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains or losses on investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within lazard s consolidated statements of financial condition 
significant management judgment is required in determining lazard s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million  with such amount partially offset by a valuation allowance of approximately million due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the book versus tax basis differences and certain net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized and  when necessary  valuation allowances are established 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the company in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or lazard adjusts these estimates in future periods  lazard may need to adjust its valuation allowance  which could materially impact lazard s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
on january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
which clarifies the more likely than not criteria included in fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  that must be met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also requires the recognition of a liability for differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements 
management applies the more likely than not criteria included in fin no 
when estimating its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates

on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which  among other things  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
pursuant to sfas no 
 lazard categorizes its investments and certain other assets and liabilities recorded at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy as follows level assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that lazard has the ability to access 
level assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable or derived principally from or corroborated by market data 
level assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability 
principally all of the company s investments in corporate bonds are considered level investments with such fair value based on observable data  principally broker quotes as provided by external pricing services 
the fair value of our equities is principally classified as level or level as follows marketable equity securities are classified as level and are valued based on the last trade price on the primary exchange for that security  public asset management funds are classified as level and are valued based on the reported closing price for the fund  and investments in private asset management funds are classified as level and are primarily valued based on information provided by fund managers and secondarily  from external pricing services to the extent managed by lam 
the fair value of our interests in lam alternative asset management funds is classified as level and is based on information provided by external pricing services 
the fair value of our private equity investments is classified as level and is based on financial statements provided by fund managers  appraisals and internal valuations 
where information reported is based on broker quotes  the company generally obtains one quote price per instrument 
in some cases  quotes related to corporate bonds obtained through external pricing services represent the average of several broker quotes 
where information reported is based on data received from fund managers or from external pricing services  the company reviews such information to ascertain at which level within the fair value hierarchy to classify the investment 
for additional information regarding risks associated with our investments  see risk management market and credit risks 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding investments and certain other assets and liabilities measured at fair value  including the levels of fair value within which such measurements of fair value fall  pursuant to the disclosure requirements of sfas no 

table of contents assets under management aum managed by lam and lfg  which represents substantially all of the company s total aum  principally consist of debt and equity instruments whose value is readily available based on quoted prices on a recognized exchange or by a broker 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  lazard makes estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities and to project future earnings using various valuation techniques 
lazard s assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill 
consolidation of vies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lazard group and all other entities in which it has a controlling interest 
lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under us gaap 
voting interest entities 
voting interest entities are entities in which i the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and ii the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses  the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities 
lazard is required to consolidate a voting interest entity that it maintains an ownership interest in if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such entity 
variable interest entities 
vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
if lazard has a variable interest  or a combination of variable interests  in a vie and it will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both  it is required to consolidate such vie 
lazard is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are vies and holds variable interests in such vies 
transactions associated with these entities primarily include investment management  real estate and private equity investments 
those vies for which lazard was determined to be the primary beneficiary were consolidated in accordance with fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
those vies included company sponsored venture capital investment vehicles established in connection with lazard s compensation plans 
in connection with the separation  lazard group transferred its general partnership interests in those vies to a subsidiary of lfcm holdings 
lazard group has determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary with respect to those vies and  as a result  the company no longer consolidates such vies 
risk management the company encounters risk in the normal course of business and therefore we have designed risk management processes to help manage and monitor such risks considering both the nature of our business and our operating model 
the company is subject to varying degrees of credit  market  operational and liquidity risks see liquidity and capital resources and monitors these risks at both an entity and on a consolidated basis 
management within each of lazard s operating locations are principally responsible for managing the risks within its respective businesses on a day to day basis 
market and credit risks lazard is subject to credit and market risks and therefore has established procedures to assess such risks  as well as specific interest rate and currency risk  and has established limits related to various positions 

table of contents with respect to lfb s operations  lfb engages in commercial banking activities that primarily include investing in securities  deposit taking and  to a lesser degree  lending 
in addition  lfb may take open foreign exchange positions with a view to profit  but does not sell foreign exchange options in this context  and enters into interest rate swaps  forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative contracts to hedge exposures to interest rate and currency fluctuations 
at december   million  or  of the approximate million of investments net of securities sold  not yet purchased of million classified as other liabilities  represented investments in debt securities held by lfb and corporate investments in equities that principally represent investments in marketable equity securities to seed new asset management products and investments in public and private asset management funds managed both by lam and third party managers as well as general partnership interests in lam managed alternative asset management funds  and are therefore subject to market risks 
these investment portfolios are monitored daily by management 
included in the amount above was million of debt securities representing approximately of investments subject to market risk  substantially all of which were in lfb s portfolio  consisting primarily of corporate bonds of which carried investment grade ratings at december  and are accounted for as available for sale securities  and secondarily  french government securities

at december   there is approximately million of pre tax unrealized losses included in aoci related to our bank s investments in corporate bonds net of interest rate swaps 
at december   million  or  of the  million of investments net of securities sold not yet purchased of million represented investments in debt securities held by lfb and corporate investments in equities that principally represent investments in marketable equity securities to seed new asset management products and investments in public and private asset management funds managed both by lam and third party managers as well as general partnership interests in lam managed funds  and are therefore subject to market risks 
included in this amount was million of debt securities representing approximately of investments subject to market risk  substantially all of which were in lfb s portfolio  consisting primarily of corporate bonds of which held investment grade ratings at december  and  secondarily  french government securities 
at december   there was approximately million of pre tax unrealized losses included in aoci related to our bank s investments in corporate bonds 
the remaining and of the investments at december  and  respectively  represent i private equity and equity method investments that are generally not subject to short term market fluctuations and ii general partnership interests in lam alternative asset management funds held directly by certain of our managing directors and employees but which are deemed to be controlled by  and therefore consolidated by  the company 
as discussed previously  the company has no economic interest  and therefore no risk with respect to these latter investments  and the associated risk remains with the minority interest holders 
for additional information regarding the company s investments  see investments above  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
lazard enters into interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge exposures to interest rates and currency exchange rates and  beginning in the second quarter of  uses equity swap contracts to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain equity investments 
at december  and  derivative contracts related primarily to interest rate swaps and equity and exchange rate contracts and are recorded at fair value 
derivative assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  with derivative liabilities amounting to million and million  at such respective dates 
the increase in derivative liabilities in as compared to related to the company s foreign exchange and interest rate hedging activities 
the primary market risks associated with lfb s securities portfolio  foreign exchange hedging and lending activities are sensitivity to changes in the general level of credit spreads and interest rate and foreign exchange 
table of contents risk 
the risk management strategies that we employ use various risk sensitivity metrics to measure such risks and to examine behavior under significant adverse market conditions  such as those we are currently experiencing 
the following sensitivity metrics provide the resultant effects on the company s operating income for the year ended december  lfb s credit spread risk  as measured by a basis point change in credit spreads totaled million and million  respectively 
lfb s interest rate risk as measured by a basis point change in interest rates totaled thousand 
foreign currency risk associated with lfb s open positions  in the aggregate  as measured by a basis point change against the us dollar  totaled approximately thousand 
lfb fully secures its collateralized financing transactions with fixed income securities 
risks related to receivables we maintain an allowance for bad debts to provide coverage for probable losses from our fee and customer receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on management s analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired 
at december   total receivables amounted to million  net of an allowance for bad debts of million 
as of that date  inter bank deposits  financial advisory and asset management fee  customer and related party receivables comprised   and of total receivables  respectively 
at december   total receivables amounted to billion  net of an allowance for bad debts of million 
as of that date  inter bank deposits  financial advisory and asset management fee  customer and related party receivables comprised   and of total receivables  respectively 
the company recorded bad debt expense of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
see also revenue recognition above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding receivables 
receivables from banks represent those related to lfb s short term inter bank deposits 
the level of these inter bank deposits is primarily driven by the level of lfb customer related interest bearing time and demand deposits and short term inter bank deposits from banks held at lfb  which can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
as the amount of deposits held at lfb change  there is generally a corresponding  but indirect  impact on the level of short term inter bank deposits with banks 
while historically the risk of loss associated with such inter bank deposits was extremely low  with the unprecedented disruption and volatility in the financial markets during  a number of financial institutions have disclosed liquidity and credit quality issues 
lfb executes such deposit agreements with leading french financial institutions and the company closely monitors the creditworthiness of such counterparties to minimize its exposure to loss in such market conditions 
based on its review of its receivables from banks at december  and  lfb has determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts related to such receivables from banks was not required 
customers and other receivables at december  includes a million receivable from the reserve primary fund the primary fund  a money market fund based in new york 
as of september   the company held an investment in the primary fund in the amount of approximately million 
on september and   the company requested the redemption of its entire investment 
effective september   before the company s investment was redeemed  the sec issued an order temporarily suspending the primary fund s obligation to honor redemption requests and calling for the orderly winding up of the primary fund and the ultimate disposition of the holdings of all investors in the primary fund 
at the present time  the primary fund is engaged in the liquidation of its assets for distribution to investors under the supervision of the sec 
the company expects to receive an amount approximating the carrying value of its receivable relating to its investment in the primary fund  but it is possible that the process of liquidating the primary fund may ultimately result in some diminution in value of the company s investment position 
the company is closely monitoring 
table of contents the situation and reserving all of its rights 
as of december   the company had received partial redemptions aggregating approximately million 
between january  and february   the company received an additional partial redemption aggregating million 
credit concentration to reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit from banking activities within lfb  the company has established limits for corporate counterparties and monitors the exposure against such limits 
at december   lfb had no exposure to an individual counterparty that exceeded million  in the aggregate  excluding deposits with inter bank counterparties 
with respect to activities outside lfb  as of december   the company s largest individual counterparty exposure was a financial advisory related fee receivable of million substantially all of which was collected subsequent to december  
risks related to short term investments and corporate indebtedness a significant portion of the company s liabilities has fixed interest rates  while its cash and short term investments generally have floating interest rates 
based on account balances as of december   lazard estimates that operating income relating to cash and short term investments and corporate indebtedness would change by approximately million  on an annual basis  in the event interest rates were to increase or decrease by 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
approximately two thirds of this balance was invested in highly liquid institutional money market funds that were invested in us government or agency securities  or in institutional money market funds that have announced that they are or will be participating in the us treasury department s temporary guarantee program for money market funds 
the remainder of the company s cash and cash equivalents was placed in short term interest earning accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world  or was used to buy short term certificates of deposit from such banks 
on a regular basis  management reviews and updates its list of approved depositor banks as well as deposit and investment thresholds 
operational risks operational risk is inherent in all our business and may  for example  manifest itself in the form of errors  breaches in the system of internal controls  business interruptions  fraud or legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance 
the company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information
