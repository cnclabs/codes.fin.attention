significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to the timing differences or a change in a valuation reserve is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made

if our tax rates change in the future  we may adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount reflecting those income tax rates

off balance sheet arrangements we do not believe we currently have any off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
foreign currency exchange rates approximately of our total net revenue for the year ended december  was derived from operations outside the united states 
we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
the accumulated currency translation adjustment  recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our us  canadian or uk entities 
the contracts entered into by the uk entity are almost always denominated in us dollars  contracts entered into by our canadian subsidiary are generally denominated in canadian dollars  and contracts entered into by our uk subsidiary are generally denominated in pounds sterling 
in recent years  with the exception of the second half of  the us dollar has weakened against many non us currencies  including the british pound and canadian dollar 
historically  as the us dollar weakened  foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non us currencies 
during the second half of  we experienced a strengthening in the us dollar and the foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non us currencies 
additionally  in the second half of  due to the strengthening in the us dollar  we experienced an unfavorable impact of million to our cash and cash equivalents balance held by our non us subsidiaries in their local currency 
we intend to continue to monitor our foreign currency exchange rate exposure and take action as appropriate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact revenue recognition  our allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  stock based compensation and provision for income taxes  valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily by selling perpetual licenses or charging for the use of our software products and providing support  training  consulting  technical and other professional services for those products 
we make available certain software products for use in hosted application arrangements without licensing perpetual rights to the software hosted applications 
additionally we provide hosting services to customers who have purchased perpetual rights to certain of our software products hosting services 
we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual license rights to software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we deem acceptance of an agreement to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted 
our typical license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions  however  if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
we deem collection probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we postpone recognition of the revenue until collection 
we sell software licenses with maintenance  varying levels of professional services  and in certain instances with hosting services 
we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
fair value for maintenance services associated with software licenses is based upon renewal rates stated in the agreements with customers  which vary according to the level of support service provided under the maintenance program 
fair value of professional services and other products and services is based on sales of these products and services to other customers when sold on a stand alone basis 
revenue from hosting services associated with software licensed under perpetual rights is recognized ratably over the period services are performed 
for contractual arrangements covering the use of our hosted applications  such as kintera sphere  etapestry and teamapproach  the stand alone value of the delivered items and fair value of undelivered items in the arrangement have not been established 
such items would include upfront activation  implementation and hosting of the solution 
for these arrangements we treat the transaction as a single element and the revenue is deferred until the hosted application is deployed and in use  at which time revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement 
revenue from transaction processing fees is recognized when received 
credit card fees directly associated with processing customer donations and billed to customers are netted in revenue in accordance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal verses net as an agent 
direct and incremental costs relating to activation and implementation are capitalized until the hosted application is deployed and in use  and then expensed over the remaining term of the arrangement 
the application of us gaap requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as we develop new products  we could experience difficulty in determining vsoe regarding the fair value of those new products 
this would result in the deferral of revenue on those transactions until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or until vsoe is established for the undelivered elements 
our consulting  installation and implementation services  are generally billed based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
for small service engagements  less than  we frequently contract for and bill based on a fixed fee plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
we recognize this revenue upon completion of the work performed 
when our services include software customization  these services are typically provided to support customer requests for assistance in creating special reports and other minor enhancements that will assist with efforts to improve operational efficiency and or to support business process improvements 
these services are not essential to the functionality of the software and rarely exceed three months in duration 
we recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  when software customization services are considered essential to the functionality of the software we recognize revenue for both the software license and the services on a percent complete basis 
these fixed price contracts are generally larger in size and longer in duration 
we recognize analytic services revenue from donor prospect research engagements  sales of lists of potential donors  benchmarking studies and data modeling service engagements upon delivery 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class  at a per attendee price or at a packaged price for several attendees  and revenue is recognized only upon the customer attending and completing training 
additionally  we sell a fixed rate program  which permits customers to attend unlimited training over a specified contract period  typically one year  subject to certain restrictions  and revenue is recognized ratably over this contract period 
we recognize revenue from maintenance services ratably over the contract term  which is principally one year 
maintenance contracts also include the right to unspecified product upgrades on an if and when available basis 
certain support services are sold in prepaid units of time and recognized as revenue upon their usage 
subscription revenue associated with hosting services  data enrichment services  data management services and online training programs  and any related set up fees  are recognized ratably over the service period of the contract 
to the extent that our customers are billed or pay for the above described services in advance of delivery  such amounts are recorded in deferred revenue 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customers a day right of return and maintain a reserve for returns 
we estimate the amount of this reserve based on historical experience 
provisions for sales returns are charged against the related revenue items 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
any necessary provision is reflected in general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in circumstances occur  we use the undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of our risks and required investment returns at the time the impairment assessment is made 
goodwill is assigned to our reporting units  which are defined as the license fees  consulting and education services  analytic services  maintenance and subscriptions operating segments 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
if an impairment is indicated  the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value  which could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we estimate fair value for each reporting unit based on projected future cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
additionally  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
we believe the assumptions we use in estimating fair value of our reporting units are reasonable  but are also unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
even if our estimated fair value of the reporting units significantly declined  no impairment would be indicated 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we determine the fair value of the stock options and stock appreciation rights using an option pricing model  which requires us to use significant judgment to make estimates regarding the life of the award  volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate and the dividend yield of our stock over the life of the award 
changes to these estimates would result in different fair values of awards 
we estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited and recognize expense only for those awards that ultimately vest 
significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to compensation expense for estimated forfeitures 
compensation expense in a period could be impacted  favorably or unfavorably  by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures 
provision for income tax and valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in a net deferred tax asset or liability that is included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the final outcome of these matters for tax reporting purposes might be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  benefits and accruals 
any difference could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

table of contents 
index to financial statements prior to october   we were organized as an s corporation under the internal revenue code and  therefore  were not subject to federal income taxes 
in addition  we were not subject to income tax in many of the states in which we operated as a result of our s corporation status 
we historically made distributions to our stockholders to cover the stockholders anticipated tax liability 
in connection with our recapitalization  we converted our us taxable status from an s corporation to a c corporation 
accordingly  since october  we have been subject to federal and state income taxes 
upon the conversion and in connection with the recapitalization  we recorded a one time benefit of million to establish a deferred tax asset 
we assess the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we include an expense within the income tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
except with respect to deferred tax assets associated with certain state income tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards  we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  and  because we expect to be able to utilize our entire net deferred tax asset 
the ability to utilize our net deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
based on current estimates of revenue and expenses  we expect future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the annual amount of additional tax deductions permitted 
even if actual results are significantly below our current estimates  the recovery still remains likely and no valuation allowance would be necessary 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
to the extent that final results differ from estimated amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and could have an impact on the deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at an amount based upon a us federal income tax rate of 
if our projected taxable income falls and our tax rate decreases  we will adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount reflecting a reduced expected us federal income tax rate 
if such change is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  fin on january  under fin we recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
such tax impact recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business 
we record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and  therefore  the probability of loss and the estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain 
these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by us 
although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters  we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any particular period

fsp fas replaces the previous useful life assessment criteria with a requirement that an entity consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements 
if the entity has no relevant experience  it would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset applies to such assets acquired after the effective date  and the disclosure requirements apply to all intangible assets recognized as of and subsequent to the effective date 
we do not expect fsp fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk through a combination of short term and long term borrowings and a mix between borrowings indexed at prime  federal funds and libor rates
