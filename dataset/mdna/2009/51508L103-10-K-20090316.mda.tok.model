item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following presents an analysis of the results and financial condition of our continuing operations 
except where indicated otherwise  the results of discontinued operations are excluded from this discussion 
we are a national  diversified  restaurant  hospitality and entertainment company principally engaged in the ownership and operation of full service  casual dining restaurants and gaming facilities 
we locate our restaurants in high profile  specialty locations in markets that provide a balanced mix of tourist  convention  business and residential clientele 
we focus on providing quality food at reasonable prices while offering a memorable atmosphere for our guests 
as of december   we operated restaurants  as well as several limited menu restaurants and other properties as described in item business  including the golden nugget hotels and casinos golden nugget in las vegas and laughlin  nevada 
termination of merger agreement on june   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger  as amended on october  the merger agreement  with fertitta holdings  inc parent  a delaware corporation  and fertitta acquisition co  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent  which are solely owned by tilman j 
fertitta  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  to acquire all of our issued and outstanding capital stock the proposed acquisition 
in order to finance the proposed acquisition  in part  mr 
fertitta entered into a debt commitment letter dated june   as amended on october  the commitment letter with jefferies funding llc  jefferies company  inc  jefferies finance llc and wells fargo foothill  llc the lenders 
in addition to the commitment to provide financing for the proposed acquisition  the commitment letter also contained a commitment by the lenders to provide alternative financing in the event the proposed acquisition was not consummated the alternative commitment 

table of contents in connection with the proxy statement required to be provided to our stockholders voting on the proposed acquisition  the securities and exchange commission sec required that we disclose certain information from the commitment letter issued by the lenders to mr 
fertitta and the company 
the commitment letter required that such information not be disclosed and be kept confidential and that disclosure of such information would be a basis for termination of the commitment letter 
we informed mr 
fertitta that we were not prepared to risk losing the alternative commitment and were therefore unable to comply with a condition of the merger which required distribution of an sec approved proxy statement to our stockholders to vote on the adoption of the merger proposal 
as a result of our inability to provide a proxy statement to our stockholders  we informed mr 
fertitta that we would be unable to consummate the proposed acquisition 
the merger agreement was terminated by agreement of the parties on january  no party to the merger agreement will be obligated to make any payments to each other as a result of the termination of the merger agreement 
professional fees and other related expenses associated with the proposed acquisition totaling million were expensed during the fourth quarter of interim senior secured credit facility on december   we entered into an million interim senior secured credit facility 
the interim senior secured credit facility provides for a million senior secured term loan facility and a million senior secured revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which were used to refinance the remaining outstanding indebtedness under our previously issued and outstanding senior credit facility and to pay related transaction fees and expenses 
hurricane ike on september   hurricane ike struck the gulf coast of the united states  causing considerable damage to the cities of galveston  kemah and houston  texas and surrounding areas 
several of our restaurants in galveston and kemah sustained significant damage  as did the amusement rides  the boardwalk itself and some infrastructure at the kemah boardwalk 
the kemah and galveston properties had been a significant driver of our overall performance in the damage to the kemah and galveston properties may adversely affect both our business and near and long term prospects 
widespread power outages led to the closure of houston area restaurants until power was restored 
all houston  galveston and kemah restaurants have reopened 
the difference between impairments arising from hurricane ike damage and the associated insurance proceeds was not material 
we also maintain business interruption insurance coverage and have recorded approximately million in recoveries related to lost profits at our affected locations in galveston and the kemah boardwalk 
this amount was recorded as revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the majority of our property losses and cash flow will be covered by property and business interruption insurance 
other matters during  as part of a strategic review of our operations  we initiated a plan to divest certain restaurants  including joe s crab shack units 
subsequently  several additional locations were added to our disposal plan 
the results of operations for all units included in the disposal plan have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the statements of income  balance sheets and segment information for all periods presented 
on november   we completed the sale of joe s crab shack restaurants for approximately million  including the assumption of certain working capital liabilities 
in connection with the sale  we recorded pre tax impairment charges and other losses totaling million 
we recorded additional pre tax impairment charges totaling million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively  to write down carrying values of assets 
table of contents pertaining to the remaining stores included in our disposal plan 
we expect to sell the land and improvements belonging to these remaining restaurants  or abandon those locations  within the next months 
in connection with our strategic review  we also identified certain restaurants that we believe are suitable for conversion into other landry s concepts 
as a result of this review  we took a charge of million during to impair certain assets relating to these conversion units to reflect our best estimates of their fair market value 
the results of operations for these restaurants are included in continuing operations 
during  we recorded impairment charges of million to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of three underperforming restaurants 
the specialty division is primarily engaged in operating complementary entertainment and hospitality activities  such as miscellaneous beverage carts and various kiosks  amusement rides and games and some associated limited hotel properties  generally at locations in conjunction with our core restaurant operations 
the total assets  revenues  and operating profits of these complementary specialty business activities are considered not material to the overall business and below the threshold of a separate reportable business segment under sfas no 
the restaurant and gaming industries are intensely competitive and affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants or casinos may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  marketing  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing operations 
we have many well established competitors with greater financial resources  larger marketing and advertising budgets  and longer histories of operation than ours  including competitors already established in regions where we are planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
we face significant competition from other casinos in the markets in which we operate and from other mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering or promoting seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
our competitors include national  regional  and local chains as well as local owner operated restaurants 
we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites

in addition  the proceeds were used to pay associated tender premiums of approximately million due to the early redemption of the senior secured notes  plus accrued interest and related transaction fees and expenses 
we expect to incur higher interest expense as a result of the increased borrowings associated with the golden nugget financing 
consistent with our policy to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and in conformity with the requirements of the first and second lien facilities  we entered into interest rate swaps for all of the first and second lien borrowings of the golden nugget that fix the interest rates at between and  plus the applicable margin 
we have designated million of the first lien interest rate swaps and all of the second lien swaps as cash flow hedging transactions as set forth in sfas these swaps mirror the terms of the underlying debt and reset using the same index and terms 
the remaining interest rate swaps associated with the million of first lien borrowings reflecting the delayed draw construction loan have not been designated as hedges and the change in fair market value is reflected as other income expense in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  a non cash expense of approximately million and million associated with these swaps was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants including minimum ebitda  fixed charge and financial leverage ratios  limitations on capital expenditures  and other restricted payments as defined in the agreements

as of december   our average interest rate on floating rate debt was  we had approximately million in letters of credit outstanding  and our available borrowing capacity was million 
as a primary result of the golden nugget refinancing and the new notes  we have incurred higher interest expense 
we expect to incur additional interest expense in the future as we continue the golden nugget expansion and due to higher interest costs arising from our refinancing 
we are constructing a hotel tower at the golden nugget las vegas which we expect to complete by at an estimated cost of million  funded primarily by the delayed draw term loan and operating cash flow 
working capital  excluding discontinued operations  increased from a deficit of million as of december  to a deficit of million as of december  primarily due to the change in the classification of our bank credit facility to long term 
cash flow to fund future operations  new restaurant development and acquisitions will be generated from operations  available capacity under our credit facilities and additional financing  if appropriate 
from time to time  we review opportunities for restaurant acquisitions and investments in the hospitality  gaming  entertainment  amusement  food service and facilities management and other industries 
our exercise of any such investment opportunity may impact our development plans and capital expenditures 
we believe that adequate sources of capital are available to fund our business activities for the next twelve months 
since april  we have paid an annual per common share dividend  declared and paid in quarterly amounts 
we increased the annual dividend to per common share in april we paid dividends totaling million during the year ended december  on june   we announced we were discontinuing dividend payments indefinitely

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had contractual obligations as described below 
these obligations are expected to be funded primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  working capital  the credit agreement and additional financing sources in the normal course of business operations 
our obligations include off balance sheet arrangements whereby the liabilities associated with non cancelable operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and standby letters of credit are not fully reflected in our balance sheets 
contractual obligations total long term debt and interest payments operating leases unconditional purchase obligations liability for uncertain tax positions other long term obligations total cash obligations other commercial commitments line of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments total these liabilities appear in total only as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of such liabilities 
after december   we completed the offering of the notes  entered into the credit agreement and refinanced our existing notes 
considering these events  the long term debt and interest payments under the contractual obligations would be million  million  million and million for    and thereafter  respectively 
in connection with certain of our discontinued operations  we remain the guarantor or assignor of a number of leased locations 
in the event of future defaults under any of such leased locations we may be responsible for significant damages to existing landlords which may materially affect our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
we estimate that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of the assignments and subleases approximate million as of december  we have recorded a liability of million with respect to these obligations 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal in nature 
our reduced winter volumes cause revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters 
we have and will continue to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets 
periodically  our sales and profitability may be negatively affected by adverse weather 
the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 
critical accounting policies restaurant and other properties are reviewed on a property by property basis for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
the 
table of contents recoverability of properties that are to be held and used is measured by comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
significant estimates used in these reviews include projected operating results and cash flows  discount rates  terminal value growth rates  capital expenditures  changes in future working capital requirements  cash flow multiples  control premiums and assumed royalty rates 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair values  reduced for estimated disposal costs  and are included in other current assets 
we operate approximately properties and periodically we expect to experience unanticipated individual unit deterioration in revenues and profitability  on a short term and occasionally longer term basis 
when such events occur and we determine that the associated assets are impaired  we will record an asset impairment expense in the quarter such determination is made 
due to our average restaurant net investment cost  such amounts could be significant when and if they occur 
however  such asset impairment expense does not affect our financial liquidity  and is usually excluded from many valuation model calculations 
we maintain a large deductible insurance policy related to property  general liability and workers compensation coverage 
predetermined loss limits have been arranged with insurance companies to limit our per occurrence cash outlay 
accrued expenses and other liabilities include estimated costs to settle unpaid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims using actuarial methodologies 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  as interpreted by fin sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
we regularly assess the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets based on forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented and adjust the related valuation allowance if necessary 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets and costs to settle unpaid claims 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements on january  we adopted fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  and fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
neither of these statements had an impact on our consolidated financial statements for in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in 
table of contents the financial statements on a recurring basis  until january  we have not yet determined the impact that the implementation of sfas  for non financial assets and liabilities  will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue  accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf 
eitf requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock  which are expected to vest  be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
we originally accounted for this tax benefit as a reduction to income tax expense 
eitf is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of eitf on january  eitf did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  implementation issue no 
e  hedging general issues involving the application of the shortcut method under paragraph issue e 
issue e amends sfas to explicitly permit use of the shortcut method for hedging relationships in which interest rate swaps have nonzero fair value at the inception of the hedging relationship  provided certain conditions are met 
issue e was effective for hedging relationships designated on or after january  the implementation of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no
