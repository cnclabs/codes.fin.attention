item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview exact sciences corporation develops proprietary dna based technologies for use in the detection of certain cancers 
we have selected colorectal cancer as the first application of our technologies 
we license certain of our colorectal cancer screening technologies  including improvements to such technologies  on an exclusive basis in the united states and canada through december to laboratory corporation of america holdings  or labcorp 
labcorp has developed and commercially offers a non invasive stool based dna colorectal cancer screening service for the average risk population  which is based on certain of our technologies 
our current focus is on commercially developing  and obtaining us food and drug administration  or fda  approval for  a colorectal cancer screening product based on our stool based dna technologies 
in january  we completed a strategic transaction with genzyme corporation  pursuant to which genzyme acquired from us  for an aggregate of million  our intellectual property assets related to the fields of prenatal and reproductive health as well as certain intellectual property outside the fields of colorectal cancer screening and stool based dna testing 
genzyme also purchased three million shares of our common stock  or approximately ten percent of our outstanding common stock  for an aggregate of million 
under our agreement with genzyme  we retained worldwide rights to our colorectal cancer screening and stool based dna testing intellectual property  and will receive a double digit royalty on any genzyme sublicensing income that may derived from the purchased intellectual property outside the fields of prenatal and reproductive health 
we and genzyme also agreed to form a joint advisory committee to assist genzyme in the achievement of product development goals related to the purchased intellectual property and to assist us with our regulatory goals 
since our inception in february  our principal activities have included researching and developing our technologies for colorectal cancer screening  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening technologies  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  pursuing reimbursement for stool based dna screening with third party payors  including the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  conducting market studies and analyzing various markets for our technologies  raising capital  licensing our certain of our intellectual property to labcorp  genzyme and others  working to further the adoption of stool based dna testing for colorectal cancer  including obtaining inclusion of our technology in the guidelines of the major guidelines organizations  pursuing us food and drug administration  or fda  clearance or approval  or exemptions therefrom  for our stool based dna screening technology for colorectal cancer  working on activities in support of the awareness around stool based dna screening  and pursuing strategic alternatives for our business  resulting in the genzyme transaction 

table of contents we have generated limited operating revenues since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with our research  development and clinical study initiatives  salaries and benefits associated with the hiring of personnel  the initiation of marketing programs and  prior to august   the build out of our sales infrastructure to support the commercialization of stool based dna screening 
we expect that our losses will continue for the next several years and we may never achieve profitability 
from the date of commercial launch through june  when labcorp stopped commercially offering pregen plus  labcorp had accessioned approximately  pregen plus samples  including approximately   and  samples during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in july  labcorp began to commercially offer colosure  its next generation non invasive  stool based dna testing service for the detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population  which is based on certain of our intellectual property 
from such date through february   labcorp has accessioned approximately colosure samples  including approximately colosure samples during the quarter ended december   and approximately colosure samples during january and february we have developed or licensed technologies related to a version colorectal cancer screening technology that we believe has greater sensitivity and is more cost effective than our version technology underlying the pregen plus testing service formerly offered by labcorp 
our version technology includes two dna markers that  in published studies  have been shown to be associated with colorectal cancer 
these markers include the aberrant methylation of the vimentin gene promoter region  which we refer to as vimentin  and dia  or long dna 
we have exclusive rights to the vimentin technology through our license agreement with case western reserve university  or case western  under which we are obligated to pay a royalty and certain other fees to case western in return for the right to use and sublicense the vimentin technology 
we own the rights to dia and do not pay any royalties on the use of dia 
in a research study evaluating stool based dna in patients with confirmed colorectal cancer and colonoscopically normal individuals  our version stool based dna technology demonstrated sensitivity of percent and specificity of percent for the detection of colorectal cancer 
labcorp s colosure testing service relies solely on the vimentin gene and does not use the dia marker that is also included in our version technology 
following the closing of our strategic transaction with genzyme in january  we have begun resuming our efforts to develop an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test for stool based dna colorectal cancer screening testing service 
as part of our development efforts and ongoing evaluation of stool based dna capabilities and market needs  we are exploring the marker combinations and platform requirements necessary for optimal performance of our technology based on market need 
objectives around performance  throughput and cost are among the elements that will need to be met in the design and development of a commercial product based on our technology 
we believe obtaining fda approval for our stool based dna colorectal cancer screening technologies is critical to building broad demand for stool based dna colorectal cancer screening technologies and for the successful commercialization of stool based dna colorectal cancer screening nationally 
we do not currently have sufficient funds to fully achieve this goal 
we may determine to develop an fda approved product containing a version technology based on beaming or digital polymerase chain reaction  or digital pcr  we may use genetic markers that are different from those used currently or in the past  we may focus on increasing the performance of our existing version technology and or we may determine that our existing version technology provides sufficient performance to enable reasonable market penetration for stool based dna for colorectal cancer detection 
during  a proof of concept study using the beaming technology  an advanced form of digital pcr developed by the johns hopkins university  in which stool and blood plasma were assessed in a head to head comparison for the detection of colorectal cancer  demonstrated percent sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer in 
table of contents stool samples 
these data were published in the august issue of gastroenterology in a paper entitled analysis of mutations in dna isolated from plasma and stool of colorectal cancer patients 
although we believe that this technology may have the potential to be more sensitive and specific than the current stool based dna colorectal cancer screening test commercially offered  version is still in the prototype stage of development 
recent developments new senior management team on march   jeffrey r 
luber agreed to resign as our president and chief executive officer effective april  also on march   mr 
luber agreed to resign from our board of directors  effective april  in addition  on march   charles r 
carelli  jr 
agreed to resign as our chief financial officer  effective april  in connection with their departure  messrs 
luber and carelli were entitled to receive severance benefits pursuant to their previously disclosed retention agreements  including salary continuation of  and  which is equal to eighteen months and fifteen months  respectively  of their base salaries as of the date of termination 
on march   we entered into release agreements with messrs 
luber and carelli that provided  in exchange for a general release in favor of us  for the accelerated payment of the salary continuation obligations on march  in addition  the release agreements also provided for the repurchase by us of options held by messrs 
luber and carelli for an aggregate of  shares of common stock  in lieu of accelerated vesting and an extension of the option exercise period arising from the prior retention agreements 
we paid messrs 
luber and carelli approximately  and  respectively  to repurchase mr 
luber s options to purchase  shares and mr 
carelli s options to purchase  shares 
the purchase price of the outstanding options represented a percent discount from the estimated fair value of the vested options as of march  messrs 
luber and carelli retained the balance of their existing options  which will remain exercisable for two years following  and will be subject to nine months acceleration of vesting upon  the termination of their respective employment with us 
we expect to record in our first quarter financial results the charges associated with the acceleration of the severance payments to messrs 
luber and carelli and the redemption and modification of their options 
on march   our board of directors appointed kevin t 
conroy as president and chief executive officer  effective april  also on march   based on the recommendation of our corporate governance and nominating committee  the board of directors elected mr 
conroy to our board 
our board of directors also appointed maneesh arora as our senior vice president and chief financial officer  effective april  in connection with their appointments  messrs 
conroy and arora entered into employment agreements with us on march  messrs 
conroy and arora are employed as vice presidents until april   when they begin service in their positions as president and chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer  respectively 
genzyme strategic transaction in january  we completed a strategic transaction with genzyme corporation  pursuant to which we assigned to genzyme all of our intellectual property applicable to the fields of prenatal and reproductive health  which we refer to as the genzyme field  and granted genzyme an irrevocable  perpetual  exclusive  worldwide  fully paid  royalty free license to use and sublicense all of our remaining intellectual property in all fields other than colorectal cancer detection and stool based disease detection 
we retained our rights in both the assigned and licensed intellectual property in the fields colorectal cancer detection and stool based disease detection 
we and 
table of contents genzyme also agreed to form a joint advisory committee to assist genzyme in the achievement of product development goals related to the purchased intellectual property and to assist us with our regulatory goals 
the collaboration period may be terminated on the fifth anniversary of the date of the agreement or sooner upon certain events 
as part of the strategic transaction  we assigned to genzyme our rights under our prior license agreement with jhu  dated march   as amended 
in return  genzyme sublicensed to us the intellectual property subject to the license agreement with jhu for colorectal cancer detection and stool based disease detection  including the beaming technology for the detection of colorectal cancer 
we and genzyme will share in the royalty and annual payment obligations to jhu 
we also amended and restated our prior non exclusive license from genzyme dated march  related to the use of certain genes  specifically apc and p  and methodologies related thereto 
in exchange for the license  which continues until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent  we have agreed to pay genzyme royalties based on net revenues received from performing tests that incorporate the licensed technology and sales of reagents and diagnostic test kits that incorporate the licensed technology  as well as certain minimum royalties  milestone payments and maintenance fees 
genzyme agreed to pay us an aggregate of million  of which million was paid at closing and million is subject to a holdback by genzyme to satisfy certain potential indemnification obligations of exact 
subject to terms of the strategic agreement  one half of the holdback amount will be released to us in months and one half will be released in months 
genzyme also agreed to pay a double digit royalty to us on income received by genzyme as a result of any licenses or sublicenses to third parties of the assigned or licensed intellectual property in any field other than prenatal and reproductive health or colorectal cancer detection and stool based disease detection 
in addition  we issued and sold to genzyme  shares of our common stock at a per share price of  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
genzyme also has the right until december  to participate in certain future private offerings of equity securities by us up to the amount necessary to maintain genzyme s pro rata percentage ownership of us  at a price per share equal to the greater of or the trading price of our common stock at the time notice is provided to genzyme of its right to purchase additional shares 
this right is subject to certain customary exclusions  including issuances to employees pursuant to a stock plan  issuances in connection with a change of control transaction and issuances in connection with strategic partnerships 
genzyme also has the right to include the shares purchased from us on a registration statement filed by us and  under certain circumstances  to cause us to file a registration statement covering the resale of such shares 
reimbursement for stool based dna screening for colorectal cancer since august  the date of commercial launch by labcorp of its stool based dna colorectal cancer screening service  labcorp billed insurers and received payment from numerous third party payors for its screening service  including more than health plans 
however  none of these third party payors ever issued formal policy approval for stool based dna screening for colorectal cancer 
following the inclusion of stool based dna screening in the colorectal cancer screening guidelines of the acs and mstf crc  twelve states and the district of columbia have adopted legislative mandates requiring that stool based dna screening be included in available colorectal cancer screening options offered by certain categories of insurers in these states 
these states include alaska  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  maine  maryland  missouri  nevada  new jersey  north carolina and rhode island 
in addition  in the second half of  cigna  one of 
table of contents the nation s largest insurers  included stool based dna screening among its covered benefits nationally 
while we view inclusion of stool based dna screening for colorectal cancer in the state mandates and the positive coverage decision by cigna as important first steps in securing wide spread coverage for stool based dna screening for colorectal cancer from private insurance carriers  we believe that obtaining strong reimbursement from payors and a positive coverage decision from cms for our stool based dna screening technology will be among the necessary elements to achieving any material commercial success 
despite the positive coverage decision from cigna and the state mandates noted above  we do not anticipate material sales relating to colosure until strong reimbursement is negotiated between labcorp and cigna and between labcorp and other payors with which it maintains contracts 
the united states public services task force  or uspstf  a us government funded organization that reviews available peer reviewed published studies to make an assessment of the benefits and risks of performing certain medical procedures  completed its year update of its colorectal cancer screening guidelines in october at that time  the uspstf  which can influence coverage decisions by payors  including cms  determined that the evidence is insufficient uspstf grade i statement to assess the benefits and harms of both stool based dna and ct colonography  or virtual colonoscopy  as screening modalities for colorectal cancer 
the uspstf gave no score to these two new tests added to the acs and mstf crc colorectal cancer screening guidelines 
many payors base their coverage decisions around colorectal cancer screening on the recommendations of the uspstf 
accordingly  our future plans may include working to accumulate and publish in peer reviewed journals additional performance data  and patient compliance and preference data  that will be useful to the uspstf  as well as to cms  in conjunction with our request for reconsideration of our ncd application 
we could incur significant time and costs to accumulate such additional data  which still may not yield positive results with the uspstf or cms 
additionally  despite the fact that our technology is included in the colorectal cancer screening guidelines of the acs and mstf crc  the fda warning letter we received with respect to the pregen plus testing service may have a similar impact on private third party payors in that  like cms  those payors may defer reimbursement policy decisions with respect to our technology until such time  if ever  as our technologies are cleared by the fda 
finally  certain members of the mstf crc may fail to separately support the position of the mstf crc  which could have a detrimental effect on our commercial and reimbursement efforts related to stool based dna screening 
the national committee for quality assurance  or ncqa  is a private  not for profit organization that  among other tasks  measures the performance of us based health care plans 
the performance measures quantified by the ncqa result in the healthcare effectiveness data and information set  or hedis 
we believe that hedis measures could be a factor used by consumers and employers when selecting among alternative healthcare plans in which to enroll 
if our stool based dna screening technology for colorectal cancer screening is not recognized by ncqa as a test that contributes to a health plan s score for the colorectal cancer screening measure  health plans may not reimburse for stool based dna testing 
despite being included in the recently updated colorectal cancer screening guidelines of the acs and the mstf crc  there can be no assurance that stool based dna screening for colorectal cancer will be adopted by the ncqa as a test that contributes to increasing the score of the hedis colorectal cancer screening measure 
the ncqa is currently reviewing the colorectal cancer screening measure and made its proposed changes available for public comment february  through march  the ncqa has determined not to include stool based dna screening in the draft hedis measure that will be used to evaluate health plan performance a retrospective measure that in looks back at performance 
a final hedis measure will be issued sometime after the results of the public comment period are analyzed 
such exclusion could materially limit our ability to secure third party reimbursement and as a result  materially limit our revenues 

table of contents compliance with nasdaq listing requirements on july   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market llc  or nasdaq  that we were not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule b a  which requires an issuer to maintain a minimum million market value of its listed securities for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
we requested a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel  which was held on october   and on november   the nasdaq listing qualifications panel determined to list our securities on the nasdaq capital market on a conditional basis  pending its review of additional information regarding our plan to evidence compliance with the requirements for continued listing on that market 
on january   we received a determination from the nasdaq stock market indicating that we had evidenced full compliance with all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
on march   we received notice from nasdaq that we were not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c  or the rule  which requires an issuer to maintain a minimum million market value of its listed securities for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
nasdaq also noted that we were not in compliance with either of the other alternatives for compliance with the rule  which require minimum stockholders equity of  or net income from continuing operations of  in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years  respectively 
this notification has no effect on the listing of our common stock at this time 
we were provided a period of calendar days  or until june   to regain compliance with the rule 
if at any time before june   the market value of our listed securities is million or more for a minimum of consecutive business days  the nasdaq staff will determine if we comply with the rule 
if we do not regain compliance with the rule by june   nasdaq will provide us with written notification that our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
at that time  we may appeal the delisting determination to a nasdaq listings qualifications panel pursuant to applicable nasdaq rules 
we are currently evaluating our alternatives to resolve the listing deficiency 
colorectal cancer screening guidelines professional colorectal cancer screening guidelines in the united states  including those of the american cancer society  or acs  the american college of gastroenterology and the american gastroenterological association  recommend regular screening by a variety of methods 
historically  such recommendations consisted of colonoscopy  flexible sigmoidoscopy  double contrast barium enema and fecal occult blood testing fobt  as well as combinations of some of these methods 
in  the acs  the us multi society task force on colorectal cancer  a consortium of several organizations including representatives of the american college of gastroenterology  american gastroenterological association  american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy and the american college of physicians society of internal medicine  collectively  the mstf crc  and the american college of radiology announced the inclusion of non invasive  stool based dna screening technology in the updated national colorectal cancer screening guidelines as a screening option for the detection of colorectal cancer in average risk  asymptomatic individuals age and above 
these new guidelines now divide colorectal cancer screening into two groups  one including non invasive methods for the early detection of colorectal cancer and the other including invasive techniques for the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer 
non invasive technologies include fecal occult blood testing and stool based dna screening for individuals unwilling or unable to use invasive screening procedures 
invasive procedures include colonoscopy  flexible sigmoidoscopy  ct colonography  and double contrast barium enema  which  according to the new guidelines  are designed to detect both early cancer and adenomatous polyps and should be encouraged if resources are available and patients are willing to undergo an 
table of contents invasive test 
while we view inclusion of our stool based dna technology in the acs and mstf crc guidelines as a critical first step toward building sufficient demand for any stool based dna screening test for colorectal cancer  we believe that fda approval or clearance of our technologies  as well as reimbursement from cms and other third party payors will be necessary to achieve any significant increase in demand for our technologies 
in addition  the acs and mstf crc guidelines indicated that new technologies and new technical versions of approved technologies need to detect a majority of colorectal cancers in a screening population to meet guidelines criteria 
neither we nor labcorp have performed a stand alone colorectal cancer screening study of labcorp s colosure test and there can be no assurance that the guidelines groups will agree that existing studies using our version technologies  and any related data supporting colosure  will meet the requirements set forth in the current acs and mstf crc guidelines for inclusion of such technologies in future guidelines of such organizations 
if the guidelines groups indicate a lack of acceptance for these more advanced technologies  such action could have a materially adverse impact on our business 
regulatory update in april  we began to focus our regulatory efforts on pursuing fda clearance for version of our technology and we submitted a pre investigational device exemption  or pre ide  request to the fda 
the objective of the pre ide process was to seek informal guidance from the fda that a k submission followed by a de novo classification request is an appropriate regulatory path for our version technology and that the clinical and other studies proposed in our version pre ide submission would likely support such a de novo regulatory path 
in july  we received feedback from the fda as to the clinical performance characteristics and the minimum number of average risk colorectal cancer samples that would be required for validation of our two marker version stool based dna technology for colorectal cancer screening 
in addition  based on our discussions with the fda  we believe that the de novo pathway would be the appropriate regulatory path for our version technology 
in july  we reduced our cost structure by suspending the clinical validation study and other studies for our version technology and eliminating eight positions within the company 
following the closing of our strategic transaction with genzyme in january  we have been exploring efforts to develop a product for sale to commercial laboratories that would enable the buyers to offer a stool based dna colorectal cancer screening testing service  which may include a version technology currently in prototype stage 
development of this product and obtaining fda clearance or approval will require the support of clinical study data 
a large clinical study will require substantial funds to complete 
developing and validating new versions of our technology will also require significant resources 
because we do not currently have sufficient funds to complete all of the development  validation  and fda studies necessary to support an fda submission of any version of our technology  we will need to gain access to additional capital through a strategic transaction  a debt or equity financing  a merger or sale of the company  or third party collaboration  if any  and or some combination of any of the foregoing in order to fund these efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing or gaining access to any additional capital to pursue these activities 
if we are unable to finance the requisite development and clinical efforts  we will not be able to complete and submit our application to seek fda approval or clearance of our stool based dna technology 

table of contents also  in july  labcorp began offering a new single marker in house laboratory developed test called colosure  which is based on certain of our version intellectual property and that does not use the effipure component 
there can be no assurance that labcorp s offering of colosure falls within the category of in house developed laboratory tests  or ldt  over which the fda has historically exercised enforcement discretion 
if the fda deems colosure a medical device that requires fda clearance or approval prior to marketing  labcorp or we may receive another fda warning letter or be the subject of other enforcement action  and labcorp may be required to discontinue offering colosure and  under such circumstances  our business would likely be materially adversely affected 
financial overview our revenue is comprised of the amortization of up front license fees for the licensing of certain patent rights to labcorp under our strategic license agreement and product royalty fees on tests sold by labcorp utilizing our technology  which has historically been based on pregen plus sales but will now be based on colosure sales 
we expect that product royalty fees for the full year will be higher than amounts recorded in as a result of the recording in and of nearly the full potential third party royalty obligations in connection with our amended license agreement with labcorp 
while we expect license fee revenue resulting from the amortization of the up front license payment from labcorp in to be consistent with amounts recorded in  we expect that total license fee revenue for will be higher than amounts recorded in as a result of the genzyme transaction 
factors affecting potential revenue growth we believe that substantial funds and managerial attention will likely need to be invested in sales and marketing efforts over the next several years for our stool based dna screening technologies to be commercially successful 
we do not have  and we cannot assure you that labcorp will devote  the funds or management resources that we believe are likely necessary to build sufficient demand for colosure 
despite the inclusion of stool based dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the state insurance mandates discussed above  we do not expect material revenue growth from labcorp s sales of colosure or from any of our potential future sales of a product that we may develop until such time as fda clearance or approval is obtained and such product is launched by us  if ever  and reimbursement is provided by cms and other third party payors at an acceptable level 
in addition  we believe our success will also depend upon a number of additional factors that are largely out of our control  including the following the impact that the inclusion of stool based dna screening in guidelines will have on prescribing physicians  third party payors  including cms  and health care consumers  any regulatory restrictions placed upon colosure  any regulatory restrictions placed upon any product or testing service that we or others may offer based on our intellectual property  success in educating third party payors  including cms  managed care organizations  and technology assessment groups regarding stool based dna screening  effective negotiation and contracting with cms and other third party payors for coverage at acceptable levels of reimbursement for stool based dna screening  patient awareness and acceptance of stool based dna screening  including its novel sample collection process  the absence of competing technologies that offer equal or better attributes than stool based dna screening  
table of contents stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  and the quality and service of the labcorp testing process 
our cost structure in july  we took actions to reduce our cost structure to help preserve our cash resources  which we refer to as the restructuring 
these actions included suspending the clinical validation study of our version technology  eliminating eight positions  or of our staff  and seeking the re negotiation of certain fixed commitments 
in connection with the restructuring and our cost reduction efforts  in december  we entered into a sublease agreement  which we refer to as the sublease agreement  with qteros  inc  or qteros  to sublease to qteros the majority of the remaining space at our corporate headquarters 
in addition to the restructuring  in july and october  we initiated cost reduction plans and reduced our workforce and other operating expenses  which we refer to as the restructuring and the restructuring  respectively  to help preserve our cash resources 
as part of the restructuring  we eliminated our sales and marketing functions  terminated six employees  and subleased a portion of our leased space at our corporate headquarters 
the restructuring eliminated positions  or of our staff at that time  across all departments 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  research and clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our technologies and  effective as of january   non cash stock based compensation recorded pursuant to sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
the completion of an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test will require extensive additional development work and evaluation 
we intend to further examine the marker combinations and platform requirements necessary for optimal performance based on market need 
in this regard  we intend to either hire new regulatory and development personnel or collaborate with third parties  or some combination of both  in order to achieve these goals 
the costs to complete development of an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test will be material  and the development will be time intensive 
we do not have  and can make no assurance that we can raise or otherwise secure  the capital necessary to complete the development and commercialization of an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test  which will require development efforts and investment  a clinical validation study to be executed in an average risk  asymptomatic screening population  a subsequent submission to the fda for clearance or approval of an in vitro diagnostic test  and sales and marketing efforts required to successfully commercialize an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test 
as a result of the activities anticipated in support of our objectives toward developing an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test  we expect research and development costs in to be higher than levels 
general and administrative expenses have consisted primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses  professional fees and  as of january   non cash stock based compensation recorded pursuant to sfas no 
r 
as a result of the restructuring  in which we eliminated our sales and marketing functions effective august   we did not incur any sales and marketing expenses in and do not expect to incur material sales and marketing operating expenses in we expect general and administrative expenses in to be higher than levels  primarily as a result of professional fees in connection with the genzyme transaction and the transition of our senior management team as described above  including payment of severance to our officers relating to their separation from the company in march significant accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance 
table of contents with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  certain third party royalty obligations  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe that that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition 
license fees license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
on june   we entered into an amendment to our exclusive license agreement with labcorp  or the second amendment  which  among other modifications to the terms of the license  extended the exclusive license period of the license with labcorp from august through december accordingly  we amortize the remaining deferred revenue balance at the time of the second amendment million on a straight line basis over the remaining exclusive license period  which ends in december product royalty fees we have licensed certain of our technologies  including improvements to such technologies  to labcorp on an exclusive basis through december labcorp developed and commercially offered pregen plus  a non invasive stool based dna colorectal cancer screening service for the average risk population based on our version technology  from august through june effective june   labcorp stopped offering pregen plus and  on july   labcorp began to commercially offer colosure  its next generation non invasive  stool based dna testing service for the detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population  which is based on certain of our version technology 
we will be entitled to the same royalty and milestone structure on any sales of colosure as we were entitled to on sales of pregen plus 
prior to the effective date of the second amendment  our product royalty fees were based on a specified contractual percentage of labcorp s cash receipts from performing pregen plus tests 
accordingly  we recorded product royalty fees based on this specified percentage of labcorp s cash receipts  as reported to us each month by labcorp 
subsequent to the effective date of the second amendment  our product royalty fees are based on a specified contractual percentage of labcorp s net revenues from sales of pregen plus through june   when labcorp stopped offering pregen plus and from sales of colosure from and after july accordingly  subsequent to the effective date of the second amendment  we record product royalty fees based on the specified contractual percentage of labcorp s net revenues from its sales of such colorectal cancer screening tests  as reported to us each month by labcorp 
the current royalty rate is  subject to an increase to in the event that labcorp achieves a specified significant threshold of annual net revenues from the sales of such colorectal cancer screening tests 
additionally  pursuant to the second amendment  we will potentially be obligated to reimburse labcorp for certain third party royalty payments  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
to the 
table of contents extent we incur liabilities in connection with this provision of the second amendment  the accretion of such liabilities will be recorded as a reduction in the product royalty fee line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
product revenue product revenue from the sale of certain components of our effipure technology to labcorp was recognized upon transfer of the components provided that title passed  the price was fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable was probable 
effipure is not used as a component in labcorp s colosure offering and we therefore do not expect to record product revenue in connection with effipure sales in future periods 
other revenue revenue from milestone and other performance based payments will be recognized as revenue when the milestone or performance is achieved and collection of the receivable is estimable and probable 
patent costs 
patent costs are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued over an estimated useful life of five years 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disallowance of the patent  upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent  or when the related intellectual property is deemed to be no longer of value to us 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets  or sfas no 
 which requires that we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
during the quarters ended june and december   we evaluated certain events which indicated that the remaining useful life or the carrying value of our patent portfolio might have been impaired 
after performing the requisite impairment analyses  we wrote off approximately  in capitalized patents during the quarter ended june  related specifically to one of the components of our version technology that is not used in labcorp s current colosure testing service  and wrote off an additional  in capitalized patents during the quarter ended december  due to uncertainty around the near term recoverability of those capitalized patent costs 
as of december   the majority of the recorded value of the patent portfolio related to intellectual property sold to genzyme in january see description of the genzyme transaction above 
stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan if certain parameters are not met  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r did not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas no 
 as originally issued and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services

our obligation to pay labcorp pursuant to this provision of the second amendment is based on labcorp s sales volumes of colorectal cancer screening tests using our technology during three separate measurement periods  as defined below 
a significant increase in such sales volumes during any measurement period  as compared to historical pregen plus sales volumes  could reduce our potential obligation during any measurement period  while test volumes consistent with historical pregen plus sales levels could result in aggregate payments to labcorp totaling up to million during the measurement periods 
until labcorp s sales of colorectal cancer screening tests using our technology increase to a level that would reduce this potential maximum obligation  if ever  we intend to record our estimated obligation under this provision of the second amendment as a reduction in the product royalty fee line item in its consolidated statements of operations  in accordance with eitf no

table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total revenue during these periods is composed of the amortization of up front technology license fees associated with our amended license agreement with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ends in december  royalties on labcorp s sales of pregen plus and colosure and sales of effipure units to labcorp as well as provisions added for our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp which are recorded as reductions to revenue under eitf effective june   labcorp stopped offering pregen plus and indicated that it had discontinued its use of effipure 
the decrease in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period of was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately million in license fee revenue resulting from the second amendment  which extended the exclusive period under our license agreement with labcorp from august to december as a result of this extension  the remaining unamortized up front license fees that labcorp previously paid to us million at the time of the second amendment are now being recognized over a longer period of time  resulting in lower non cash license fee amortization as compared to prior periods 
in addition  product royalty fees were approximately million lower for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  due to charges of million recorded during in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in connection with our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in charges in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in connection with our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
these charges to product royalty revenue were recorded pursuant to the second amendment and resulted in negative product royalty revenue for the years ended december  and in june  labcorp stopped offering pregen plus  the version of the stool based dna technology that utilizes effipure and has been the subject of fda inquiry over the past several years 
in july  labcorp began offering colosure  a new stool based dna test that is different from our version technology and is based solely on the vimentin gene  a methylated dna marker that in published studies was shown to be associated with colorectal cancer 
pursuant to our license agreement with labcorp  we are entitled to the same royalty and milestone structure on sales of colosure as we were entitled to on sales of pregen plus 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of the continuing effect of the cost reduction plans undertaken in and as described under the heading our cost structure above 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   included decreases of million in licensing costs  million in lab related operating expenses  million in personnel related expenses  and million in non cash stock based compensation charges resulting primarily from the june issuance of  shares of our common stock to oncomethylome sciences sa  or oms  on june  pursuant to the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement with oms 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of million when comparing the year ended december  with the year ended december  
table of contents as well as a decrease of million in salary  benefit and other costs due to lower general and administrative headcount during the year ended december   as compared to the same period of the decrease in non cash stock based compensation was due primarily to the non recurrence of one time non cash stock based compensation charges of million taken in the third quarter of related to the acceleration and the extension of the expiration date of certain stock options held by don m 
hardison  our former president and chief executive officer  pursuant to a separation agreement between us and mr 
hardison in connection with his resignation in august these decreases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by an increase of million in professional fees in connection with our strategic review process  our reimbursement efforts with cms and our regulatory efforts with the fda 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the elimination of our sales and marketing functions effective august   as described under the heading our cost structure above 
restructuring 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the three months ended september   including million in one time termination benefits arising under retention and severance agreements with each of the terminated employees and million resulting from the write off of leasehold improvements abandoned by us in connection with the reduction in force 
our decision to eliminate of our workforce as part of the restructuring was deemed to be an impairment indicator under sfas no 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  non cash asset impairment charges of million were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related leasehold improvements to their net realizable value 
in addition  in connection with the restructuring  our board of directors accelerated the vesting of  shares under terminated employees previously unvested stock options  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  and extended the expiration date of all the terminated employees outstanding options as of their date of termination  covering an aggregate of  shares with a weighted average exercise price of  through august  pursuant to the measurement provisions of sfas no 
r  we recorded one time non cash stock based compensation charges of approximately  in the restructuring line item of our consolidated statements of operations during the quarter ended september  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a sublease agreement  which we refer to as the sublease agreement  with qteros  inc  or qteros  to sublease to qteros approximately  square feet of rentable area in our corporate headquarters 
the term of the sublease agreement  which commenced on december   is months with a base rent of  per year 
pursuant to the sublease agreement  qteros has no rights to renew or extend the sublease agreement 
under the terms of the sublease agreement  qteros will be required to pay its pro rata share of any increases in building operating expenses and real estate taxes and to provide a security deposit in the form of an irrevocable  standby letter of credit from a national commercial bank reasonably acceptable to us in the amount of approximately  naming us as beneficiary 
the sublease agreement provides for our employees to continue to occupy approximately  square feet in the premises subleased to qteros 
we believe that such  square feet are adequate to meet our space requirements with respect to administrative needs 
we believe that the development of an fda approved product for colorectal cancer screening will require that we lease additional space 
in this regard  we are currently exploring additional space in madison  wisconsin 
in connection with the sublease agreement  we also recorded the following restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of included opposite the caption facility consolidation costs 
table of contents in the table below approximately million in future cash payments related to the difference between our committed lease payments and the estimated sublease rental income under the sublease agreement  approximately million in one time real estate transaction and laboratory decommissioning fees  and approximately million of non cash charges related to the write off of leasehold improvements abandoned by us in connection with the sublease agreement 
these charges were offset by cash receipts of approximately million received in connection with sales of fully depreciated fixed assets upon commencement of the sublease agreement

interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of  as well as less favorable interest rates on investments held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  total revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fees associated with our amended license agreement with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ends in december and  to a lesser extent  royalties on labcorp s sales of pregen plus  and sales of effipure units to labcorp 
effective june   labcorp stopped offering pregen plus and indicated that it had discontinued its use of effipure 
the decrease in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately million in non cash license fee amortization revenue resulting from the second amendment  which extended the exclusive period under our license agreement with labcorp from august to december as a result of this extension  the remaining unamortized up front license fees that labcorp previously paid to us million at the time of the second amendment are now being recognized over a longer period of time  resulting in lower non cash license fee amortization as compared to prior periods 
in addition  product royalty revenues were million lower for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december   due to charges of million recorded in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in the year ended december  in connection with a certain third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
these charges to product royalty revenue were recorded pursuant to the second amendment and resulted in negative product royalty revenue for the year ended december  our obligation to pay labcorp under this provision of our amended license agreement is based on labcorp s sales volumes of pregen plus during three measurement periods over the exclusive license period  which ends in december a significant increase in pregen plus test sales volumes during any of the measurement periods described under the heading critical accounting estimate third party royalty obligation above could reduce our obligation related to that period  while test volumes consistent with historical pregen plus sales levels could result in aggregate payments to labcorp of up to million over the remaining exclusive license period 
based on sales volumes that we anticipated in light of the current regulatory and reimbursement status of our technology  as of december   we accrued 
table of contents million of the total potential million obligation related to the first measurement period  which ended in december future increases in this obligation  to the extent necessary  will continue to be recorded as charges to the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations 
cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total cost of revenue includes both the cost of effipure components sold to labcorp as well as the cost of product royalty revenue owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
during  we recorded charges to cost of revenue of approximately million as a result of labcorp s decision to discontinue use of effipure in the processing of pregen plus tests 
these write offs resulted in the decrease in cost of revenue when comparing the year ended december  to december  as of december  and  the carrying value of our effipure inventory was under the terms of the second amendment  we may be obligated to pay labcorp up to a maximum of million in connection with certain costs related to effipure   of which was charged to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended september  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the cost reduction plan undertaken in connection with the restructuring 
pursuant to the restructuring  we took actions to reduce our headcount across all departments in order to lower our overall cost structure and focused our research and development organization on the optimization and validation of our version technology 
included in the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were decreases of million in personnel related expenses  million in laboratory operating costs  million in laboratory supplies  million in non cash stock based compensation charges related to employee option awards  and million in clinical study expenses  all of which resulted from the restructuring activities discussed above 
these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in licensing costs of million  related primarily to licenses for our version technology 
this increase included approximately million in non cash stock based compensation recorded in connection with the issuance of  shares of our common stock to oms on june  sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of the elimination of our sales and marketing functions effective august   as described under the heading restructuring above 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in non cash stock based compensation expense due to the acceleration of the vesting of  shares of previously unvested stock options  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  held by don m 
hardison  our former president and chief executive officer  as well as the extension of the expiration date of all of mr 
hardison s outstanding options  covering an aggregate of  shares  through august  mr 
hardison resigned from the company effective august   and  pursuant to a separation agreement between us and mr 
hardison  mr 
hardison is prohibited from selling  prior to august   any of the shares of common stock obtained upon the exercise of any accelerated stock options 
in connection with these stock option modifications  we recorded one time stock based compensation charges of approximately million in the quarter ended september  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses was an increase in professional fees of million in connection with our 
table of contents ongoing regulatory efforts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in salary  benefit and other costs due to a reduction in general and administrative headcount during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  restructuring 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the three months ended september  primarily related to one time termination benefits arising under retention and severance agreements with each of the terminated employees 
see restructuring above 
restructuring 
the restructuring was implemented to reduce employee related costs  as well as our overall research and development and sales and marketing costs  in order to preserve existing cash and cash equivalents 
pursuant to the restructuring  we accrued charges of million in the quarter ended december  in connection with one time employee termination benefits  including severance and outplacement services 
all amounts owed pursuant to the restructuring were paid out through september and were recorded under the caption accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at december  interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was due primarily to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of our equity securities  cash received from labcorp in connection with our license agreement  and cash received in january from genzyme in connection with the genzyme transaction described above 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and million in restricted cash  which has been pledged as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit in connection with the lease for our marlborough  massachusetts facility 
in addition  we received gross proceeds of million in unrestricted cash in january upon closing of the genzyme transaction 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was to fund our net loss 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as well as for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to decreases in research and development and sales and marketing spending as a result of multiple restructuring and cost reduction actions taken during  and  which are discussed elsewhere in this report 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in our operations  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
excluding the impact of purchases and 
table of contents maturities of marketable securities  net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of cash receipts from sales of fully depreciated equipment in connection with our sublease agreement 
purchases of property and equipment of approximately  during the year ended december  were significantly lower than purchases of property and equipment for the years ended december  and as a result of the cost reduction efforts undertaken in discussed elsewhere in this report 
as a result of the cash received in january in connection with the genzyme transaction and based on our plans for further development of our stool based dna technology for colorectal cancer detection  we expect that purchases of property and equipment during will be higher than amounts invested in amounts invested in our patent portfolio in were materially consistent with amounts invested during and we expect that investments made in our patent portfolio during will be materially consistent with amounts invested during net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and was the result of decreases in restricted cash in connection with the lease for our corporate headquarters and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and purchase plans 
we expect that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   together with the receipt of million in january in connection with the genzyme transaction  will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months  based on current operating plans 
the projection is based on our currently anticipated cost structure and operating assumptions  which include allocations related to collection of stool samples for study purposes which would likely be used to support an fda submission for clearance or approval of our stool based dna technology for colorectal cancer screening 
such allocations do not provide for the full funding of the commercial development of our stool based dna technology and related fda submission and commercialization efforts or other programs and initiatives 
we do not expect that product royalty payments or milestone payments from labcorp will materially supplement our liquidity position in the next twelve months  if at all 
since we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue  we believe that we will need to raise additional capital to complete the development  fda submission for clearance or approval  and commercialization of our technologies  including an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test for stool based dna colorectal cancer screening 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our operations through the completion of the development of such a test  the submission to the fda for clearance or approval of the test  and commercialization of the test  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected and we may be required to delay such efforts and otherwise scale back our operations 
even if we successfully raise sufficient funds to continue our operations to fund the development  fda submission  and commercialization of our technology  including an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test for stool based dna colorectal cancer screening  we cannot assure you that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations to become profitable 

table of contents the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period description total less than one year years years more than years in thousands obligations under license and collaborative agreements operating lease obligations severance obligations purchase obligations total obligations under license and collaboration agreements represent on going commitments under various research collaborations and licensing agreements 
this category includes a potential obligation to reimburse labcorp for a certain third party royalty  up to an aggregate maximum of million  during three defined measurement periods between june  and december  although payment of this potential obligation is dependent upon labcorp s sales levels of pregen plus and colosure during the measurement periods  the total potential million obligation has been included in the table above based on historical sales levels of pregen plus and current sales levels of colosure as of december  commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party 
operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with leased facilities in marlborough  massachusetts 
purchase obligations primarily represent a potential obligation to reimburse labcorp for certain costs related to effipure as well as commitments associated with our operating activities 
severance obligations represent remaining commitments to personnel terminated in connection with the restructuring 
the table above excludes approximately million of severance commitments which were triggered in march in connection with the departure of mr 
luber  our president and chief executive officer  effective april  and mr 
carelli  our chief financial officer  effective april   as described elsewhere in this report 
we do not have any special purpose entities or any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
our anticipated future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued funding of our development efforts  including product development and fda submissions  clinical and other studies required for such fda submissions and resubmission of our cms application for approval of our technologies  and continued investment in our intellectual property estate 
our future capital requirements may depend on many factors  including the following the regulatory requirements for colosure  or other stool based dna testing services utilizing our technologies  and the timing of any required regulatory approval process  our ability to attract third parties to support the development of an fda cleared or approved product based on our technologies  acceptance  endorsement and formal policy approval of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  our ability to achieve milestones under our strategic agreement with labcorp  a determination that additional studies surrounding our technologies are needed  a sustained level of interest and commitment by labcorp in the commercialization of our technologies  
table of contents stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  opportunities to license additional third party intellectual property  threats posed by competing technologies  new out licensing arrangements relating to our technologies  and the successful commercialization and sales growth of colosure  or other stool based dna testing services utilizing our technologies 
additionally  labcorp could decide  or be required  to stop offering colosure  or could decide to stop offering colosure until it has been approved or cleared by the fda  if ever 
either of these situations will limit our revenue and materially adversely affect our business and cash reserves 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities of the us governments and its agencies and in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper  bank certificates of deposit and corporate bonds  all of which are currently invested in the united states and  as of december   were classified as available for sale 
we held no investments at december  we place our cash equivalents and marketable securities with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
