the company we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the rapid development of novel small molecule drugs to treat serious diseases for which there are limited treatment options 
our current lead clinical candidates are directed at treating alzheimer s disease  huntington s disease and castration resistant prostate cancer 
our alzheimer s and huntington s disease programs are partnered with pfizer inc  or pfizer  and our prostate cancer program remains unpartnered 
with pfizer  we are conducting a broad dimebon clinical development program  including a pivotal and confirmatory phase trial in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
the program also includes additional phase trials beginning this year in both alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease 
in addition  we are conducting phase clinical trial of mdv in patients with castration resistant also known as hormone refractory prostate cancer  and plan to seek fda approval to begin a phase trial this year 
in september  we announced a collaboration agreement with pfizer  which became effective on october  under the terms of the agreement  we and pfizer will develop and commercialize dimebon  our investigational drug for treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease 
we and pfizer will share the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing dimebon for the united states market on a pfizer medivation basis  and will share profits or losses resulting from commercialization of dimebon in the united states in the same proportions 
outside the united states  pfizer will bear all development and commercialization costs  and will pay us tiered royalties on aggregate net sales of dimebon 
in october  we received a non refundable  up front cash payment of million pursuant to our collaboration agreement with pfizer 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized million in collaboration revenue attributable to our up front payment from pfizer 
previously we had not recognized any revenue 
we have funded our operations 
table of contents primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  and from the up front payment and cost sharing payments from our collaboration agreement with pfizer 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and expect to incur substantial and increasing additional losses in the future as we expand our research and development activities 
our pipeline dimebon in alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease our lead product candidate  dimebon  has successfully completed the first of two pivotal clinical trials required to seek marketing approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  in the us for mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
we began our confirmatory pivotal phase alzheimer s disease trial in the second quarter of  and expect to complete enrollment in that trial in dimebon also has successfully completed a phase clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate huntington s disease  the top line results of which we reported in july dimebon has been shown to inhibit the death of brain cells  or neurons  in preclinical models of alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease  making it a potential novel treatment for these neurodegenerative diseases 
based on data generated in independent third party laboratories  we believe that dimebon operates through a novel mitochondrial mechanism of action 
mdv in castration resistant prostate cancer our proprietary compound mdv is currently in a phase clinical trial in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer  or crpc 
we completed enrollment in that trial in december mdv is the lead clinical development candidate from a library of approximately small molecules licensed by our subsidiary  medivation prostate therapeutics  inc these molecules were rationally designed to treat castration resistant prostate cancer by modulating the androgen receptor  or ar  in a different manner from currently approved ar antagonist drugs  which generally are ineffective in treating prostate cancers that have become castration resistant 
we intend to seek fda approval to begin a phase clinical trial of mdv in crpc in new product candidates we remain actively engaged in identifying new product candidates  both internally and externally  to further expand our pipeline of product candidates 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the non refundable up front payment of million we received in the fourth quarter of pursuant to our collaboration agreement with pfizer 
for a description of the collaboration agreement  see note the collaboration agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables  and requires evaluation pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreement to determine whether it had obligations 
table of contents constituting deliverables under eitf we concluded that it had multiple deliverables  including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services in the us we estimated that the period in which we would perform those deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in the first quarter of we also concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting under eitf accordingly  we will recognize the non refundable  up front payment of million as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated performance period  using the proportional performance model 
estimation of the performance period of our deliverables requires the use of management s judgment 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance period include  but are not limited to  its experience  along with pfizer s experience  in conducting clinical development activities 
we will review the estimated duration of our performance period on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
future changes in our estimate of the performance period may materially impact the timing of future revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement 
under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive up to million in development and regulatory milestone payments 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments  and concluded that these events except for those relating solely to development and commercialization in japan  where we have no contractual responsibilities constituted milestones under proposed eitf issue no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition eitf 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  and that achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us 
management then concluded that each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  that substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the up front payment and the potential milestone payments  and that the milestone payments relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive milestone payments based on development and regulatory events in japan  milestone payments based on commercial events globally  profit sharing payments on sales of dimebon products in the us  and royalties on sales of dimebon products outside the us we will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in fasb concept statements based on those criteria  we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenues  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 
under the collaboration agreement  we and pfizer share certain dimebon related development and commercialization costs in the us on a pfizer  medivation basis 
the parties make quarterly true up payments between themselves to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared commercialization costs 
we account for cost sharing true up payments that we receive from pfizer as reductions of expense rather than as revenue 
stock based compensation we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  to stock based compensation awards 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of non cash compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our restated equity incentive award plan  based on estimated fair values 
we have applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  in our adoption of sfas no 
r 

table of contents stock compensation arrangements with non employee service providers are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  which increased our reported research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses during those periods 
these expenses break out as follows in millions year ended december  selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense we calculated these expenses based on the fair values of the stock based compensation awards as estimated using the black scholes model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions about expected future volatility of our stock price and the expected term of the options that we grant 
calculating stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r also requires us to make assumptions about expected future forfeiture rates for our option awards 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements previously granted was million  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of several subjective assumptions  including assumptions of expected stock price volatility  expected stock option term and forfeiture rates  and expected risk free rates of return 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current and past periods 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties to provide research and development services to us  costs are expensed as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials and other research and development activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and contract research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various research and development activities in the on going development of our product candidates  including without limitation  third party clinical trial centers and contract research organizations that perform and administer our clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials and other research and development activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific agreement 
our estimates are dependent upon the timelines and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustment to our research and development expense in future periods 
to date  we have had no significant adjustments 

table of contents accounting for income taxes on january   we adopted fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
there were no accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of december  we had million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative historic losses represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position  or fsp  fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  or fsp fsp clarified the application of fas fsp demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  effective for us as of january  this standard establishes criteria for determining whether freestanding instruments or embedded features are considered indexed to an entity s own stock 
this guidance must be applied in assessing the equity conversion features in our outstanding warrants 
these conversion features have been exempted from derivative accounting because they are indexed to our own stock and would be classified in stockholders equity 
we will have to assess whether they are still considered indexed to our own stock under this new guidance 
the standard applies to all outstanding instruments at january   with any transition impacts recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we are evaluating the impact  if any  this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year  effective for fiscal years beginning after november   as it relates to non financial assets and liabilities 
the company does not expect that the adoption of fas will have a significant impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company 
results of operations years ended december   and collaboration revenue year ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue 
table of contents we recorded million of amortized collaboration revenue in connection with our dimebon collaboration agreement with pfizer in the year ended december  in october  we received an upfront payment of million  which we are amortizing over a period of approximately years based on the expected performance period of our deliverables under this agreement 
further  we are eligible to receive payments of up to million upon the attainment of certain development and regulatory milestones plus certain additional undisclosed commercial milestone payments 
at present  we are unable to predict the timing or likelihood of such milestone payments  although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments from pfizer in the year ended december  see note in the notes to financial statements for further details on our collaboration with pfizer 
there were no revenues in or research and development expense year ended december  in thousands research and development expense percentage increase the increase in research and development expense of or million in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in clinical and preclinical study expense of million 
additionally  we had an increase in payroll related costs of million as we increased research and development headcount by employees during  offset by a decrease in other department costs of million 
the increases in clinical and preclinical study costs  including associated payroll costs  were driven primarily by significant expansions in our clinical development work for both dimebon and mdv  including initiation of our ongoing confirmatory phase clinical trial of dimebon in alzheimer s disease and continuation of our ongoing phase clinical trial of mdv in castration resistant prostate cancer 
the increase in research and development expense of or million in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in clinical and preclinical study expense of million driven primarily by a significant expansion in our clinical development work for dimebon as we extended our first pivotal clinical study in alzheimer s disease and realized a full year of clinical expenses for the phase clinical trial of dimebon in huntington s disease which began in october additionally  we had an increase in payroll related costs of million as we increased headcount by employees  and an increase in other associated departmental costs of million 
under our collaboration agreement with pfizer  we share certain dimebon related development costs in the us on a pfizer  medivation basis 
the parties make quarterly true up payments between themselves to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared development costs 
we account for development cost true up payments as additions to research and development expense  when such payments are made by us  and as reductions to research and development expense  when such payments are made to us 
for the year ended december   total development cost true up payments to us were million  reflecting costs incurred following october   the effective date of the collaboration agreement 
there were no such payments in prior periods 
to date  we have been engaged in two major research and development programs the development of dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease  and the development of mdv for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer 
other research and development programs consist of preclinical stage programs  primarily our dimebon analog program 
research and development costs are identified as either directly allocable to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist primarily of clinical and preclinical study costs  cost of supplying drug substance and drug product for use in clinical and preclinical studies  contract research organization fees  and other contracted services pertaining to specific clinical and preclinical studies 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs including both cash costs and non cash stock based compensation 
table of contents costs  corporate overhead costs  and other administrative and support costs 
the following table summarizes the direct costs attributable to each program and the total indirect costs for each respective period 
year ended december  in thousands direct costs dimebon mdv other total direct costs indirect costs total research and development expenses the company did not track research and development expense by project prior to we expect our research and development expenses to increase in as we further expand development of dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease  and mdv for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer  and other programs 
our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
selling  general and administrative expense year ended december  in thousands selling  general and administrative expense percentage increase selling  general and administrative expenses consisted of primarily payroll and related costs associated with corporate administration and executive management  facilities  marketing and medical science personnel  professional services including legal and accounting services  medical education and other administrative costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of or million in as compared to was due primarily to payroll and related costs of million  a fee of million paid to our financial advisor in connection with our collaboration agreement with pfizer  and increases in patent fees of million 
these increases in selling  general and administrative costs were incurred primarily in support of our expanded research and development work  and our collaboration agreement with pfizer 
selling  general and administrative headcount increased by employees during the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of or million in as compared to was due primarily to increased patent and other professional fees of million  payroll and related costs of million  other department costs of million incurred primarily in support of our expanded research and development work 
selling  general and administrative headcount increased by employees during under our collaboration agreement with pfizer  we share certain dimebon related commercialization costs in the us  including pre launch commercialization costs  on a pfizer  medivation basis 
the parties make quarterly true up payments between themselves to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared commercialization costs 
we account for commercialization cost true up payments as additions to selling  general and administrative expense  when such payments are made by us  and as reductions to selling  general and administrative expense  when such payments are made to us 
for the year ended december   total commercialization cost true up payments to us were million  reflecting costs incurred following october   the effective date of the collaboration agreement 
there were no such collaboration payments in prior periods 

table of contents we expect total selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in  as those costs tend to move in parallel with our research and development expenses 
interest income  net year ended december  in thousands interest income  net percentage increase decrease the decrease in net interest income of or million in the year ended december  as compared was primarily attributable to interest income on lower average cash balances and lower prevailing interest rates 
we received our million up front license fee from pfizer on october   so its impact on our average cash balance for the full year was limited 
the increase in net interest income of in compared to was primarily attributable to interest income on higher average cash balances and higher prevailing interest rates 
other income expense  net year ended december  in thousands other income expense  net the increase in other income expense  net of million in as compared to was due to a payment of million we received for a securities law violation by one of our unaffiliated stockholders resulting in short swing trading profits that were remitted back to us  offset by realized losses on foreign exchange payables of million 
there were no such realized losses in and as currency rates change and our international clinical activities increase  we may record income or expense to other income expense  net related to our clinical vendor payable balances 
based on current tax law  million of the million up front payment we received from pfizer in the fourth quarter of was recognized as revenue for federal and state income tax purposes in the year ended december   which is equal to the amount recognized for financial statement purposes 
the remaining amount of million will be recognized as revenue for both federal and state tax purposes in the year ended december   regardless of financial statement revenue recognition 
we therefore expect to have taxable income for that year 
in response to budgetary pressures  the state of california has temporarily suspended the use of net operating loss carryforwards for the tax year as well as imposed limitations on the amount of credits that can offset california tax 
consequently  we expect to incur state income tax liabilities in based on current forecasts and due to certain exemptions granted to companies regarding the alternative minimum tax  we do not expect to incur federal income tax liabilities in if earnings increase from our forecasts in excess of our federal net operating losses and other tax assets  the company may incur a federal tax liability 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have incurred cumulative net losses of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial and increasing additional losses in the future as we expand our research and development activities 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we and do not expect to generate 
table of contents product revenue for several years  if ever 
in the year ended december   we generated million in collaboration revenue from the pfizer collaboration agreement 
all of our operations to date have been funded through the sale of our debt and equity securities  the million up front payment we received from pfizer on october   and cost sharing true up payments from pfizer 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million available to fund operations 
in addition  at december   the remaining capacity under our committed equity line of credit with azimuth opportunity  ltd 
was million 
the azimuth facility expires on april   and we do not anticipate drawing any additional amounts under that facility prior to its expiration 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
pfizer collaboration agreement in september  we announced a collaboration agreement with pfizer 
under this agreement  we and pfizer will collaborate on development of dimebon for alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease for the united states market  including associated regulatory filings with the fda 
in addition  following fda approval and launch of dimebon in the united states  we  at our option  and pfizer will co promote dimebon to specialty physicians in the united states  and pfizer will promote dimebon to primary care physicians in the united states 
pfizer will be responsible for development and seeking regulatory approval for  and commercialization of  dimebon outside the united states 
after a period of transition from our contract manufacturers to pfizer  pfizer will be responsible for all manufacture of product for both clinical and commercial purposes 
both we and pfizer have agreed not to commercialize for the treatment of specified indications any other products directed to the same primary molecular target as dimebon for a specified time period  subject to certain exceptions 
the agreement establishes several joint committees consisting of an equal number of representatives from both parties that will operate by consensus to oversee the collaboration 
in the event that a joint committee is unable to reach consensus on a particular issue  then  depending on the issue  a dispute may be decided at the joint committee level by the party to whom the contract grants final decision on the issue or escalated to senior management of the parties 
if a dispute is escalated to senior management and no consensus is reached  then the dispute may be decided by the party with the final decision on such issue 
other issues can only be decided by consensus of the parties  and unless and until the parties representatives reach agreement on such issue  no decision on such issue will be made  and the status quo will be maintained 
under the collaboration agreement  pfizer paid us an up front cash payment of million in the fourth quarter of we are also eligible to receive payments of up to million upon the attainment of development and regulatory milestones plus additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain net sales levels for the product 
we and pfizer will share the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing dimebon for the united states market on a basis  with pfizer assuming the larger share  and we and pfizer will share profits or losses resulting from the commercialization of dimebon in the united states in such proportions 
outside the united states  pfizer will bear all development and commercialization costs and will pay us tiered royalties on the aggregate net sales of dimebon 
if one of the parties merges with  or acquires or is acquired by  a third party and as a result such party must divest its interest in the dimebon collaboration due to a governmental requirement  then the other party has the first right to purchase the divesting party s interest in the collaboration  on terms to be negotiated by the parties 
in the event that the parties are unable to agree on the terms of this purchase after following the negotiation procedure outlined in the collaboration agreement  the divesting party will have a time limited right to sell its interest in the collaboration to a third party 
however  the terms of this sale must be more favorable than any terms offered by the non divesting party and the third party will remain bound by the terms of the collaboration agreement 
in the event the non divesting party declines to purchase the divesting party s interest  the divesting party may sell its interest in the collaboration to a third party on any terms but such third party will remain bound by the terms of the collaboration agreement 

table of contents we are permitted to terminate the collaboration agreement for an uncured material breach by pfizer 
pfizer has a right to terminate the collaboration agreement unilaterally  after months following dimebon s first commercial sale  but can earlier terminate at its discretion with advance written notice to us if clinical data for dimebon generated after the effective date do not meet certain specified criteria or if regulatory approval is conditioned or delayed 
in the event of our uncured material breach of the collaboration agreement  pfizer may elect either to terminate the collaboration agreement or to keep the collaboration agreement in place  but terminate our right to participate in development  commercialization other than co promoting dimebon and other activities for dimebon  including the joint committees and decision making for dimebon 
however  such termination would not affect our financial return or  unless we commit an uncured material breach of our co promotion obligations  our co promotion rights 
following any termination of the collaboration agreement  all rights to develop and commercialize dimebon will revert to us  and pfizer will grant a license to us to enable us to continue such development and commercialization  and will supply product to us during a specified transition period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market accounts and short term investments in highly liquid us treasury securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if 
table of contents market interest rates rise 
the million up front payment we received from pfizer on october  has been fully invested in short term us treasury securities and in money market funds consisting solely of short term us treasury securities 
interest rate risk as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents consisting of highly liquid money market accounts 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid money market accounts 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents at december   a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million for these investments 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we held million in short term investments  which consisted entirely of u 
s 
treasury securities maturing in less than twelve months 
the weighted average interest rate of our investments held was approximately during a decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
based upon our balance of short term investments at december   a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million for these investments 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our short term investments 
foreign currency exchange risk we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the us although we conduct some research and development work with vendors outside the us  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we expect our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to increase due primarily to expansion of our ex us clinical development activities  which we expect will result in an increase in foreign currency denominated payment obligations 
this trial includes clinical sites in europe and south america  and certain of our payment obligations with respect to those sites will be denominated in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   we recorded less than million in foreign currency exchange losses 
as of december   we have recorded the equivalent of approximately million of foreign denominated vendor payables 
a hypothetical change of in currency rates could result in an adjustment to the consolidated statements of operations of approximately million and could result in our paying approximately million more or less in cash than anticipated at december
