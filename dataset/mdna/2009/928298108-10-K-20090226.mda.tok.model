item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of market risks 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks  particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
from time to time  we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in germany  israel  and asia 
we finance our operations in europe and certain locations in asia in local currencies 
our operations in israel and most significant locations in asia are largely financed in us dollars  but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where  for example  production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in us dollars 
this situation is particularly evident for products produced in israel  the czech republic  and china 
we estimate that a movement in the value of the us dollar against all foreign currencies would impact our net earnings by approximately million  although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected 
for example  a weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the us dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies  which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in us dollars or have the us dollar as their functional currency 
if the us dollar strengthened or weakened by versus each of the following foreign currencies  with all other currencies being held constant  we estimate that our net earnings would increase decrease as follows in thousands strengthening weakening currency euro   israeli shekel   british pound   taiwan dollar chinese renminbi singapore dollar hong kong dollar czech koruna hungarian forint philippines peso all other currencies  net   all currencies simultaneously   a change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical movement in the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical movement in the value of the us dollar  particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time 
commodity price risk although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources  certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price changes for these raw materials 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices 
we are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum  a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors 
there are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder 
we are acquiring tantalum raw material from all of them under short term commitments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information on our previous long term tantalum purchase commitments  which expired in palladium  a metal used to produce multi layer ceramic capacitors  is currently found primarily in south africa and russia 
palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility 
we periodically enter into short term commitments to purchase palladium 
certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets  and can be subject to significant price volatility 
our policy is to enter into short term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget 
for much of  these metals were trading near all time record high prices 
during the fourth quarter of  as metals prices declined significantly from these record high prices  we entered into commitments to purchase a portion of our estimated metals needs  principally for copper and palladium 
after entering into these commitments  the market prices for these metals continued to decline 
as a result  we recorded losses on these adverse purchase commitments during the fourth quarter of we estimate that a increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by million  assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices 
the declines in metals prices experienced during the latter half of were more significant than the hypothetical change in prices cited above 
for example  the market price of copper at december  was over lower than the record high price attained earlier in our purchase commitments as of december  only represent a portion of our metals needs
