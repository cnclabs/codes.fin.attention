company overview midway is a precious metals exploration company focused on the creation of value for shareholders by exploring and developing quality precious metal resources in stable mining areas 
midway operates from an office in helena  montana and from field offices in lovelock and tonopah nevada 
these offices support the spring valley  midway and pan projects  respectively 
these offices also support work on five other exploration projects  located on four of the major nevada gold trends 
midway currently controls certain mineral rights on the cortez  humboldt and round mountain gold trends 
business strategy and development we have four advanced exploration projects the spring valley  the pan and the midway projects in nevada and the golden eagle project in washington and four early stage exploration targets in nevada 
midway plans to continue to attempt to expand these new gold discoveries through exploration 
below is a summary of our work completed in and our expectations for our projects in spring valley project the spring valley project is a diatreme porphyry hosted gold system beneath pediment gravels 
drilling from february to august completed holes including  feet of rc and  feet of core drilling targeting significant mineralization recognized outside the current resource 
nearly of these new holes had significant gold intercepts 
drilling has now identified a coherent gold zone  feet long by  feet wide and extends to a depth of  feet 
known mineralization remains open to the north  southwest and at depth 
gold intercepts for holes were reported on july   including feet of opt gold within feet of opt gold in sv and feet of opt gold in sv and feet of opt gold in sv new gold discovered in the big leap zone on the north end of the deposit was reported on september  intercepts in this zone included feet of opt gold with feet of opt gold in hole sv and sv with feet of opt gold within feet of opt gold 
the big leap zone has been intercepted over feet along strike  is to feet wide  and is still open to both the north and south and at depth 
two outlying targets  the fitting and limerick areas  were tested with a total of exploration drill holes with no significant results 
results from deep core drilling tested a gold bearing porphyry intrusive as announced on january  the more significant intercepts were in hole sv c including feet of opt gold from feet to feet and feet of opt gold from  feet to  feet 
hole sv c reported feet of opt gold from feet to feet and feet of opt gold from feet to feet 
barrick has the exclusive right to earn a interest in the spring valley project by spending us  on the property over five years 
barrick may increase its interest by total by spending an additional us  in the year immediately after vesting at 
at midway s election  barrick may also earn an additional total by carrying midway to a production decision and arranging financing for midway s share of mine construction expenses with the carrying and financing costs plus interest to be recouped by barrick once production has been established 
midway will coordinate geologic and administrative activities during the earn in period for a negotiated administrative fee 
see item description of properties spring valley project for a more detailed description of the agreement with barrick 
barrick is required to conduct and fund exploration in on the spring valley project at a minimum level of us  barrick has informed midway its program will include  feet of infill core and reverse circulation drilling and approximately twelve holes will be drilled for metallurgical testing purposes pan project a large scale soil survey identified four previously unknown gold arsenic anomalies with no previous exploration drilling 
results from a recently completed detailed gravity survey have also outlined several new targets areas 
as a result  additional claims were staked bringing the property position to square miles 
in midway completed  feet of drilling in rc holes 
drilling at south pan found additional near surface oxide gold mineralization 
the wendy zone was expanded to the east where it extends under volcanic cover and step out drilling at nana encountered more new gold both zones are open for expansion 
three target areas outside the resource were tested with no significant results 
fourteen new holes in the resource area were targeted to verify results from previous operators  of which most intercepted higher grades and greater thicknesses than previously reported press release july  
preliminary investigations suggest that assay techniques used by a previous operator may have under estimated gold values in some of the holes 
if confirmed by additional drilling  then portions of the deposit could show improved grades 
a new higher grade gold zone has also been identified over feet in length at north pan with true widths ranging from to feet and grades ranging from to opt gold 
at a minimum midway s staff will prepare an internal updated mineral resource estimate in which will guide the next exploration step for the pan project 
pending additional financing from the exercise of share purchase warrants or an equity private placement in and based on the results of the updated mineral resource estimate the next step would either be infill and exploration drilling or the company would commission an independently prepared preliminary assessment report scoping study 
the amount of drilling required will determine the cost of the program 
midway project in  initial mining plans were submitted to the blm and ndep for an underground decline providing access for collection of a bulk sample and high grade verification at the midway project 
drilling for hydrology and geotechnical testing was completed on rc holes for  feet and core holes for  feet 
while drilling these holes  two new high grade veins were discovered press release may  
final permit submission is pending approvals from the state water engineer 
hydrologic testing suggests that pumping up to  gallons per minute may be required to dewater the project 
midway is currently negotiating a plan to properly dispose of this water with the town of tonopah and the state water engineer 
permitting efforts will continue in as midway reviews potential capital benefits from mining the bulk sample on a smaller scale 
midway processing test work by sgs lakefield research limited canada showed up to gold recovery using gravity and cyanide from a lb 
composite sample of discovery vein material grading opt gold 
further work by gekko systems metallurgical laboratory australia indicates that without using cyanide  a gravity and flotation process could achieve gold recovery and silver recovery  based on a lb 
composite sample  grading opt gold and opt silver 
we completed a cost analysis to convert the high grade veins  intercepted by previous drilling  into reserves and this underground bulk sample plan is the most effective way to advance the project 
this allows us the opportunity to determine the true grade of the veins and help to delineate reserves and move toward production 
the actual date of beginning the decline will depend upon the length of time it takes to receive regulatory approval  which typically takes to months 
in addition  we have several hurdles to overcome such as processing site  financing  and availability of contract mining equipment and personnel 
the high grade nature of the deposit and simple metallurgy make the underground bulk sample a logical and attractive next step in the exploration and development of the gold deposit 
the decline will be an inclined adit underground tunnel that will be driven to develop access feet below high grade portions of the midway  rochefort and dauntless veins see table below and map attached 
from these three veins a  ton bulk sample will be taken and processed 
gold recovered from the bulk samples will offset a portion of the development costs 
the decline will also provide a platform to explore and develop high grade vein intercepts currently identified on the project 
in the event that exploration results support a development decision  then underground workings and permits will be in place to begin full scale mining 
golden eagle project on august  the company issued  common shares at us per common share for proceeds of us  by way of a private placement to kinross gold usa inc kinross and concurrently purchased a interest in the golden eagle  washington  project from kinross at a cost of us  the company then purchased a interest in the golden eagle project from hecla limited at a cost of us  kinross retained a net smelter returns royalty and was granted a first right of refusal to toll mill ore from the golden eagle property at their kettle river mill 
midway completed the acquisition of the golden eagle property through a wholly owned subsidiary created to hold the property 
in  midway acquired the golden eagle project and began compiling and reviewing the historic database of drill holes containing  feet of mostly core drilling  to create a modern gold model 
in  santa fe pacific gold estimated that the golden eagle deposit contained million tons grading ounce per ton opt gold in a historic resource as part of an internal scoping study 
a qualified person has not reviewed this resource and the historical estimate should not be relied upon 
efforts in will be conducted by midway staff and funded from working capital and will be directed toward key issues  including metallurgy testing  for moving the project towards a new scoping study  including a ni compliant resource  high grade target identification  evaluation of processing methods  and reviewing permitting 
staff is compiling and reviewing the historic data base of drill holes containing  feet of mostly core drilling to create a modern gold model 
pending additional financing from the exercise of share purchase warrants or an equity private placement in and the internal review of the project by staff the next step would be to commission an independent ni compliant updated mineral resource estimate an expected cost of up to us  exploration projects the roberts gold formerly the afgan project is a sediment hosted gold deposit located on the battle mountain eureka gold trend 
midway developed a new target concept in using geophysics and surface exploration  concluding that volcanic rocks of the northern nevada rift may cover favorable host rocks in a gravel fill area 
the afgan claim holdings on the southern part of the property were returned to the leaseholder due to a limited target host rocks potential 
the company is seeking a joint venture partner for this project 
the gold rock property is a square mile land position with known gold deposits located on the battle mountain eureka trend 
this is a sediment hosted gold system in highly prospective host rocks 
a historic database of holes containing  feet of drilling was acquired outlining continuous mineralization along  feet of length 
surface work  geophysics and historic data review have identified a number of exploration targets 
a total of  feet in rc drill holes were drilled on the anchor target during the most significant intercept was feet of opt gold starting at feet in ar four other holes found strongly anomalous gold in the pilot formation  a regionally favorable host rock 
target and data compilation is in progress 
the surface exploration and geophysics program on the burnt canyon project identified targets in this volcanic hosted epithermal system 
disseminated gold identified in rock chip and soil sampling at five different areas have been selected as drill targets 
the project lies between high grade veins in the seven troughs district 
the company is seeking a joint venture partner for this project 
in  midway drilled  feet in rc holes on the thunder mountain project testing for high grade veins to complement the mineralization at the midway project  located six miles to the northwest to follow up drilling which intercepted higher grade gold in silicified breccias hosted rhyolite tuff containing feet of opt gold beginning at a foot depth press release october  
results from included feet of opt gold at foot depth  and two veins were intercepted with the most significant intercept reporting feet true thickness of opt gold in the beckie vein press press release may  
continued exploration on the thunder mountain project is being funded by kinross gold usa pursuant to an agreement 
kinross has added to the claim position in the project area and in late december kinross completed a first pass drill program comprising rc drill holes containing  feet 
the drilling off set the known beckie zone and targeted three other areas in the project 
assays are pending

summary of quarterly results unaudited quarter ended in quarter ended in dec sept june march dec sept june march in thousands  except per share and total cash cost per ounce data revenue from the sale of minerals nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil net loss net loss per share  basic and diluted quarter ended in dec sept june march revenue from the sale of minerals nil nil nil nil net loss net loss per share  basic and diluted notes and factors affecting comparability of quarters the company is a mineral exploration company at the development stage and has no operating revenues 
stock based compensation costs are a non cash expense and represent an estimate of the fair value of stock options granted 
these expenses are often the largest item included in the statement of operations and they represent a significant source of variation in loss from quarter to quarter 
stock based compensation is allocated between salaries and benefits and mineral exploration expenditures 
costs for the june quarter tend to be higher due to printing and mailing of shareholder material for the company s annual general meeting and costs of conducting this meeting 
costs for the december quarter also tend to be higher due to accruals for the annual audit 
administratively  management tends to critically review all exploration projects in detail at this time of year and makes decisions about which projects it wishes to continue and which projects it will abandon 
the effect of the change in accounting policy to expense all exploration expenses instead of capitalizing them was taken in the fourth quarter of in this md a and the net loss shown for each quarter is as previously reported 
financial condition and liquidity the company began the year with cash on hand of  during the company expended  on operations  invested a total of  in mineral property and equipment and raised  from the issue of shares for cash and  from the issue of a promissory note of which  was paid back in to end at december  with cash on hand of  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the company is a going concern  which contemplates the realization of its assets and the settlement of its liabilities in the normal course of operations 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent upon obtaining the financing necessary to meet its financial commitments and to complete the development of its properties and or realizing proceeds from the sale of one or more of the properties 
the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders  the ability of the company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations  confirmation of the company s interests in the underlying properties  and the attainment of profitable operations 
as at december   the company had cash of  working capital of  and has accu mulated losses of  since inception 
our auditor s report on our consolidated financial statements include an additional explanatory paragraph that states that our recurring losses from operation raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management anticipates that the minimum cash requirements to fund its proposed exploration program and continued operations will exceed that amount 
accordingly  the company does not have sufficient funds to meet planned expenditures over the next twelve months  and will need to seek additional debt or equity financing to meet its planned expenditures 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to raise sufficient cash to fund its future exploration programs and operational expenditures 
these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
recently  the poor conditions in the us housing market and the credit quality of mortgage backed securities continued and worsened in  causing a loss of confidence in the broader us and global credit and financial markets and resulting in the collapse of  and government intervention in  major banks  financial institutions and insurers and creating a climate of greater volatility  less liquidity  widening of credit spreads  a lack of price transparency  increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions 
these disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
these disruptions could  among other things  make it more difficult for us to obtain  or increase our cost of obtaining  capital and financing for our operations in the future 
our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect to rely upon additional financing to fund our planned operating budget throughout the current fiscal year 
if costs increase substantially or we incur greater losses than expected  our exploration activities and other operations will be reliant upon equity financings to continue into the future 
the current market conditions could make it difficult or impossible for us to raise necessary funds to meet our capital requirements 
if we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments  we will seek multiple solutions including  but not limited to  credit facilities or debenture issuances 
on november  we issued  common shares and  common share purchase warrants for proceeds of  each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share at per share until may  at march  midway s share price closed at on the tsx venture exchange well above the exercise price of the warrants 
if all the warrants are exercised the proceeds will be  the company agreed with golden predator inc that of the proceeds of any warrants exercised pursuant to this private placement will be applied to the remaining  owed on the promissory note until it is paid 
in  we issued a total of  common shares pursuant to the exercise of stock options for cash proceeds of  as of march   in addition to the  share purchase warrants outstanding there are  stock options at prices ranging from to 
while it is probable that some of these options will be exercised  it is not possible to predict the timing or the amount of funds which might be received 
midway plans to raise capital in to fund its continued exploration and development 
contractual obligations there are no contractual obligations other than those described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements

inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with regulatory requirements 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as of december   we have accrued us   related to reclamation and other closure requirements at our properties  compared to us  from december  these liabilities are covered by a combination of surety bonds and restricted cash totaling  at december  
we have accrued as a current liability what management believes is the present value of our best estimate of the liabilities as of december   however  it is possible that our obligations may change in the near or long term depending on a number of factors 
critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements include our estimate of recoverable value on our property  plant and equipment  site reclamation and rehabilitation as well as the value assigned to stock based compensation expense 
these estimates involve considerable judgment and are  or could be  affected by significant factors that are out of our control 
the factors affecting stock based compensation include estimates of when stock options might be exercised and the stock price volatility 
the timing for exercise of options is out of our control and will depend  among other things  upon a variety of factors including the market value of midway shares and financial objectives of the holders of the options 
we used historical data to determine volatility in accordance with black scholes modeling  however the future volatility is inherently uncertain and the model has its limitations 
while these estimates can have a material impact on the stock based compensation expense and hence results of operations  there is no impact on our financial condition 
midway s recoverability evaluation of its mineral properties and equipment is based on market conditions for minerals  underlying mineral resources associated with the assets and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale 
midway is in an industry that is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties  including exploration risk  development risk  commodity price risk  operating risk  ownership and political risk  funding and currency risk  as well as environmental risk 
bearing these risks in mind  midway has assumed recent world commodity prices will be achievable 
we have considered the mineral resource reports by independent engineers on the midway  spring valley and pan projects in considering the recoverability of the carrying costs of the mineral properties 
all of these assumptions are potentially subject to change  out of our control  however such changes are not determinable 
accordingly  there is al ways the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties and equipment 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as a result midway has recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs it expects to incur 
the company estimated applicable inflation and credit adjusted risk free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames 
to the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change  such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk midway has no publicly or privately traded securities or market instruments aside from our own equity 
the only publicly traded securities are the common shares of midway  which trade on nyse amex and tsxv other than a promissory note due for payment in july as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have no other debt instruments subject to interest payments  sales contracts  swaps  derivatives  or forward agreements or contracts  or inventory 
midway has no currency or commodity contracts  and we do not trade in such instruments 
midway has no cash flow or revenue from operations 
our operating funds are currently provided by equity issuances 
we have to date always raised funds in canadian dollars although we incur the majority of our expenditures in canadian and united states dollars 
the shares of midway are listed for trading on nyse amex and tsx 
v and accordingly our ability to raise equity funds and the price at which such issues are sold is directly related to the activity and price of our shares on such exchange 
in addition  as we incur expenditures in both canadian and united states currencies we have exposure to foreign currency gains or losses 
we do not currently enter into any contracts or arrangements to hedge against currency fluctuations 
we have no debt instruments which are subject to interest payments 
we periodically access the capital markets with the issuance of new shares to fund operating expenses  and we do not maintain significant cash reserves over periods of time that could be materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates
