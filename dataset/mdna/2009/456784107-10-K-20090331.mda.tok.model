industry trends and  risks according to a january report by deutsche bank  in  overall worldwide wireless handset sales increased by approximately in  however  they are forecasted to decrease in by  before returning to growth in and  with growth estimated at each year 
this same report estimates latin american excluding brazil could decrease in  before returning to growth in and at a rate of each year 
a rapid decline in wireless handset sales in the central and south american markets we serve has and could continue to negatively impact our net sales 
excess supply conditions and the current economic downturn have and may continue to reduce demand for our products and reduce the market prices of the products we sell and therefore affect our ability to generate net sales  margins and gross profit at expected levels and could continue to affect the value of our inventory 
for example  the second half of saw a decrease in handset demand globally as well as in our sales regions and an increase in carrier inventory  which both had a negative impact on our financial results during conversely  should manufacturers be unable to respond to an unanticipated increase in demand on a timely basis  we  along with others in our industry  could experience supply constraints that would affect our ability to deliver products 
we are unable to quantify these effects  as it is difficult to predict future supply conditions and demand patterns which affect our ability to meet customer demand or sell handsets at an acceptable gross profit 
company specific trends and risks our long term strategy incorporates overall market growth elements for our business  which we hope will result in future growth as global economic conditions recover 
certain of our manufacturers entered into the low tier handset market during and continued to market them in  which has had a positive impact on our volumes of handsets sold  but a negative impact on gross profit margin 
our verykool proprietary line of products  for which we had six models selling as of december   continued to show orders and sales during of and is expected to become an increasing part of our overall business in the future 
during  and  our verykool products continued to increase product diversification in central and south america  which should continue to be beneficial as we move forward and work towards profitability again 
we have significant control over the 
table of contents verykool line of products  whereas for oem products we perform distribution and other services to the extent needed by the oem s 
in the united states and mexico  we halted substantially all sales during much of our significant united states customer base completed the transitional stage as regional carriers  including some of our customers being acquired in by at t  t mobile usa and verizon wireless 
with our potential united states customer base significantly reduced by the second quarter of  we decided to discontinue this portion of our operations  together with the discontinuation of our operations in mexico 
we substantially completed the discontinuation of these operations by the end of these two areas accounted for less than of our net sales in  as compared to of our net sales for generally  our industry was impacted by the economic slowdown impacting the united states and the rest of the world 
we believe that some of the countries in the regions we operate  particularly in central america  have close economic relations with the united states  and have been impacted by the economic situation in the united states during in particular  as well as  generally globally 
we believe this impacted consumer demand for our wireless handsets and accessories in some of the countries we operate  and therefore our overall operations  including net sales  during were adversely impacted 
recent events on july   we  received a nasdaq staff deficiency letter indicating that for the last thirty consecutive business days the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq stock market under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule e  we were provided an initial period of calendar days  or until january   to regain compliance 
the nasdaq stock market has extended the compliance date several times  with the current compliance date being on or about october  during the compliance period on or about october   absent the occurrence of any unexpected events  our common stock is expected to continue to trade on the nasdaq global market 
if compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule a cannot be demonstrated on or about october   the staff of the nasdaq stock market listing qualifications department is expected to deliver a written notification to us that our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq global market 
if we receive a delisting notice  we may appeal the nasdaq staff s determination to a listing qualifications panel 
alternatively  we may apply to transfer our securities to the nasdaq capital market or another exchange or trading market 
we intend to monitor the bid price of our common stock and consider available options if our common stock does not trade at a level likely to result in our regaining compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price rule 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales from continuing operations of million were generally consistent with our net sales from continuing operations of million for average selling price of wireless handsets sold in remained relatively constant  as compared to however  we experienced a decrease in overall wireless handset sales volume  due primarily to the impact of the worsening economic slowdown in the markets we serve  most notably in central america  during the second half of the geographic mix of net sales shifted in as sales in south america increased to more than of net sales  as compared to of net sales in sales in central america decreased to of total net sales in  as compared to in

in addition  we continued efforts to market and sell our proprietary verykool line of products in south and central america 
in south america  net sales were million for  a increase from this increase was primarily due to increased sales in existing countries  most notably argentina  and the addition during the first half of of a new carrier relationship in colombia 
in central america  net sales decreased to million for  which was primarily due to the continuing unusually low demand during the third and fourth quarters of we believe the worsening worldwide economic downturn impacted that region also  especially during the second half of net sales by geographic region for the year ended december  increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands central america south america total cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  or of net sales  and gross margin was  as compared with million  or of net sales  and for gross margin for the year ended december  the increase in our cost of sales both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and decrease in gross margin were primarily due to inventory write downs  sales of some products at or below cost and the product mix shift  including increased sales of low margin products 
inventory write downs during were approximately million  or of cost of sales  and in addition  we sold product below our cost in order to reduce inventory levels and incurred costs of million on these products 
these actions primarily resulted from of the abrupt shift in market conditions and resulted in decreased demand  particularly in central america  in the second half of we had immaterial inventory write down in some of our oem partners that had previously entered into the low tier handset range continued to sell a higher amount of low tier handsets  which had less margin opportunity than mid tier and high end handsets sales 
our gross margin continues to be impacted by the change of product and regional mix of our sales  as different products and different regions have varying margins 
the worsening economic downturn has also reduced consumer demand for higher priced and higher margin products

as a percentage of net sales from continuing operations  operating expense increased to in the year ended december   as compared with for last year 
the increase in operating expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in marketing activities related to sales of our products  as we continue to create brand awareness at the point of sale 
marketing expenses increased approximately million in as compared to in addition we had product tooling and engineering expenses related to the verykool products during increase million in as compared to marketing  tooling and engineering increases were primarily due to the increased penetration and by sales of our verykool branded products 
we believe that pursuant to our efforts  and assuming economic conditions improve  future sales and margins could provide gross profits to better cover operational costs 
in addition  management continues to review expenses in an effort to better match the operational costs with the future business opportunities 
we believe such measures will assist us as we strive to return to profitability

during  we received million in compensation from our early lease termination and relocation of our corporate headquarters 
during  we also incurred  of interest expense  compared to  for last year  primarily due to a lower average outstanding balance on our line of credit as well as generally lower borrowing rates

in south america  our efforts enabled sales to new customers and new countries as well as additional sales to existing customers 
these increases were offset by the decrease in overall average product unit selling price due to our manufacturing partners entering into the low tier product segment

in the central america region  in the beginning of  a significant decrease in handset demand as a result of industry wide excess inventory in the channel for that particular region impacted our ability to sell higher margin products 
during the second half of  we saw channel inventory generally return to normalized levels in central america 
gross margin was further negatively impacted as certain of our manufacturers entered into the low tier handset range 
for the year ended december   our gross profit decreased to million from million  for the same period in  a decrease of 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of higher volume of sales of low tier products which have lower margins  sold in central and south america and to higher channel inventory levels  as well as generally lower sales of handsets in central america during the first quarter of these factors depressed our gross margin and decreased the opportunity for sales of higher margin products

the net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   which resulted primarily from substantially decreased inventory and accounts receivable levels 
the million decrease in inventory at december  in addition to a million decrease in prepaid inventory were primarily attributable to our efforts to reduce inventory levels as a result of worldwide economic conditions

days of sales outstanding days of sales outstanding the average number of days it takes to collect revenue after a sale is made at december  was days  compared with days at december  this decrease was due to continuous efforts to keep our customers to the payment terms we provide 
normal payment terms require our customers to pay on a net day or net day basis depending on the customer 
we are constantly working with our customers to reduce our days of sales outstanding 
the extension of net day terms was required to remain competitive in the regions we currently operate  central and south america 
in an effort to penetrate new markets and reach new customers  we may offer terms beyond our normal terms

net cash provided from financing activities the net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  of million was primarily the result of borrowings on our bank line of credit and approximately  from the exercise of employee stock options  compared to  where cash provided by financing activities was million  including million  net of associated offering costs  for the sale of stock and exercise of stock options  with the remainder being from borrowing from our bank line of credit

borrowings until april   we had a line of credit from wells fargo hsbc trade bank na  which provided for advances not to exceed of eligible domestic accounts receivable and up to of foreign insured accounts receivable depending on the country of the debtor  up to a maximum of million 
on april   we entered into a loan  security and bulk purchase agreement and a letter of credit and security agreement with wells fargo century  inc  replacing the then existing asset based secured credit facility with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na pursuant to the wells fargo century line of credit  we may obtain advances of up to  based on the expected collections of eligible receivables as well as value of our eligible inventory determined in accordance with the wells fargo century line of credit 
the outstanding advances may not exceed the lesser of i  or ii the sum of the value of the eligible receivables and eligible inventory multiplied by their respective advance rates as set forth in the agreement million as of december  
the wells fargo century line of credit has a two year term ending april and is secured by all of our assets 
the interest rate for each borrowing under the wells fargo century line of credit is  at our option  either the wells fargo bank na prime rate minus at december  or the libor rate plus at december  
we believe we were in compliance with the terms of the wells fargo century line of credit at december  as of december   the majority of our debt was based on foreign insured accounts receivable 
we have no other debt financing payable 
at december  and december   the amounts drawn against our applicable line of credit were million and million  respectively 
credit lines have been important parts of operating our business  and market changes affecting accounts receivable could diminish the borrowing

at december  and december   advances were at and of the available borrowing base 
at february   we had million drawn against our line of credit  which was of the available borrowing base 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results  and require management s judgments to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenues for wireless handset and accessory sales are recognized when i shipment of the products to customers has occurred and title has passed  ii when collection of the outstanding receivables is probable and iii the final price of the products is determined  which occurs at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  cooperative arrangements marketing  training and promotional funds  returns  and allowances 
consideration is given on select sales for cooperative arrangements related to market development  training and special promotions  usually agreed upon in advance 
the amount given is generally in the form of a credit memo  which is applied as a reduction of the sale price and such amount is recorded as a current liability 
expenditures made pursuant to the agreed upon activity reduce this liability 
to the extent that we incur costs in excess of the established cooperative fund  we recognize that amount as a selling or marketing expense 
as part of the sales process  we may perform certain value added services such as programming  software loading and quality assurance testing 
these value added services are considered an ancillary component of the sales process and amounts attributable to these processes are included in the unit cost to the customer 
furthermore  these value added services are related to services prior to the shipment of the products  and no value added services are provided after delivery of the products 
we recognize a reserve against the related receivables estimates for product returns based on historical experience and other judgmental factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis and adjust the estimates each period based on actual product return activity 
we recognize freight costs billed to our customers in revenue and actual freight costs incurred as a component of cost of sale activity 
allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sales transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment on a net or day basis depending on the customer 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change  including increasing the risk of collectability and sales returns  and may require additional provisions  which could negatively impact our operating results 
inventory write off and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand for a period of time  generally three months 
because of obsolescence  we will generally provide a full reserve for the costs of our inventories in excess of our relevant demand forecast for the applicable period 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we limit inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding several months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  we sometimes build inventories in excess of demand for the applicable future periods 
if this occurs  we provide a reserve  which may have a negative impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition 
such was the case during  as we adjusted some of our inventory down to market values 

table of contents contractual obligations we lease corporate and administrative office facilities  and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
certain of these leases contain renewal options 
rent expense under these leases was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurement 
sfas no 
also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy

 which permits a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
with regard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the company adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january   except for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis for which delayed application is permitted until our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no

this standard allows companies to elect fair value accounting for many financial instruments and other items that currently are not required to be accounted as such  allows different applications for electing the option for a single item or groups of items  and requires disclosures to facilitate comparisons of similar assets and liabilities that are accounted for differently in relation to the fair value option 
sfas is effective for fiscal years 
table of contents beginning after november  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
recently issued the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued fasb statements no 
revised sfas r  business combinations  and no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
these new standards represent the completion of the fasb s first major joint project with the international accounting standards board iasb 
the fasb and the iasb first initiated the joint project that resulted in the new standards because us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards ifrs differed widely in their approach to accounting for business combinations 
the iasb plans to issue its counterpart standards ifrs revised  business combinations  and international accounting standard as revised in  consolidated and separate financial statements  early next year 
the new standards to be issued by the iasb are expected to contain the same fundamental principles as those of the fasb  but will diverge with respect to certain issues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for us refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding revolving line of credit 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding  which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
the interest rate for the revolving line of credit is the prime rate minus at march  or libor plus at march  
for every increase in our bank s prime rate or libor  our interest expense would increase by  assuming the same million remained outstanding for the entire year 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that we would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 

table of contents market risk a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets outside the united states  however all sales transactions and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of our international sales  our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our market risk management includes an accounts receivable insurance policy for both our domestic and foreign sales 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance policy will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  economic or regulatory conditions on its results of operations and financial position 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations had a material impact on our financial results during  or
