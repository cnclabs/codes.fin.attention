item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors  forward looking statements for information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business  securities  financial condition or operating results  reference is made to the disclosure set forth under item a above under the caption risk factors 
in addition  because the following discussion includes numerous forward looking statements relating to us  our results of operations and financial condition and business  reference is made to the information set forth above in item under the caption important factors relating to forward looking statements 
as has been widely reported  financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption  including  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
among other risks we face  the current tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future  including  if necessary  to fund strategic acquisitions  and our ability to refinance any of our long term debt 
in addition  current economic conditions could harm the liquidity or financial position of our customers or suppliers  which could in turn cause such parties to fail to meet their contractual or other obligations to us 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
overview we are primarily engaged in the production  grading  packing  and sale of fresh shell eggs 
our fiscal year end is the saturday nearest to may which was may  weeks  may  weeks  and june  weeks for the most recent three fiscal years 
our operations are fully integrated 
at our facilities we hatch chicks  grow pullets  manufacture feed  and produce  process  and distribute shell eggs 
we currently are the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the united states 
shell eggs accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and in fiscal egg products accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and in fiscal we primarily market our shell eggs in the southwestern  southeastern  mid western and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
shell eggs are sold directly by us primarily to national and regional supermarket chains 
we currently use contract producers for approximately of our total egg production 
contract producers operate under agreements with us for the use of their facilities in the production of shell eggs by layers owned by us 
we own the shell eggs produced under these arrangements 
approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us is purchased from outside producers for resale  as needed 
our operating income or loss is significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which can fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
retail sales of shell eggs historically have been greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
our need for working capital generally is highest in the last and first fiscal quarters ending in may and august  respectively  when egg prices are normally at seasonal lows 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer 
shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods  particularly thanksgiving  christmas and easter 
consequently  we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in august and may  respectively 
as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons 
our cost of production is materially affected by feed costs  which currently averages about of our total farm egg production cost 
changes in market prices for corn and soybean meal  the primary ingredients of the feed we use  result in changes in our cost of goods sold 
the cost of our feed ingredients  which are commodities  are subject to factors in which we have little or no control such as volatile price changes caused by weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs  demand and the agricultural and energy policies of the united states and foreign governments 
market prices for corn remain higher in part because of increasing demand from ethanol producers 
market prices for soybean meal remain higher as a result of competition for acres from other grain producers 
however  our feed costs were lower than the previous quarter with both corn and soybean meal prices moving sharply lower after reaching record levels during the summer of calendar year feed costs  while much improved  will likely remain relatively high and could be volatile in the year ahead 
the purchase of zephyr egg  llc and tampa farms  llc described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements are collectively referred to below as the acquisitions

percentage of net sales fiscal years ended may  may  june  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses operating income other income expense income before taxes income tax expense net income executive overview of results may   may   and june  our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which can fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
primarily  our shell eggs are sold at prices related to the urner barry spot egg market quotations for the southeastern region of the country 
the following table shows our net income loss  net average shell egg selling price  and the average urner barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region  for each of our three most recent fiscal years 
fiscal year ended may  may  june  net income loss in thousands net average shell egg selling price urner barry spot egg market quotations average daily price for the fiscal year the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
the periods of high profitability reflect increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss reflect excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand 
historically  demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth 
as reflected above  our operating results correspond with changes in the spot egg market quote 
the net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs  including non graded shell egg sales  breaking stock and undergrades 
in fiscal and  shell egg demand increased at higher than normal trend rates due to the increased popularity of high protein diets 
this demand imbalance caused shell egg prices to increase 
in late fiscal  the popularity of these high protein diets began to diminish  but our egg production had been increased to meet the earlier higher demand levels 
lower egg prices followed  and we experienced net losses in fiscal and beginning in the latter part of fiscal  egg supplies appeared to become more aligned with demand 
since that time  the supply demand balance has tightened 
tighter supplies resulted in increased prices in fiscal  and prices reached record levels in fiscal these increased prices resulted in significantly improved profitability 
in fiscal  egg prices declined as compared to fiscal due to the state of the overall economy  we saw demand decrease at the food service level 
egg sales at the retail level remain strong 
as a consequence of the current economic situation and the drop in demand at the food service level  there was a drop in egg prices 
future levels of profitability will be highly dependent on the relationship between demand levels and the supply of eggs available 
according to usda reports  domestic table egg production was higher for five of the first six months of calendar year this is a reversal of the trend from to for of the consecutive months from to domestic shell egg production was lower 
this has translated into falling egg prices 
based upon usda reports  the company expects that the table egg laying flock will expand in the upcoming months of calendar year due to the anticipated expansion in the laying flock  shell egg production for the remainder of calendar year is expected to be slightly above production during the comparable period of calendar year fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  net sales 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales consisted of shell egg sales and approximately was for sales of egg products  with the balance consisting of sales of incidental feed and feed ingredients

the calculation of the stock based compensation plans expense is dependent on the closing stock price of the company s common stock  which decreased from at may  to at may   which is a decline in the company s stock price 
specialty egg expenses represent advertising  commissions  and franchise fees as they are incurred with sales of our specialty eggs 
the expense increase is attributable to the increase in the dozens of specialty eggs sold this year as compared to last fiscal year 
payroll and overhead expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the cost of employee benefits which includes health insurance 
there was also a slight increase in salaries and wages 
other selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in our insurance costs

other expense for fiscal was  as compared to other income of million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
we had higher average long term borrowing balances and our average invested cash balances were lower 
the effect of higher average long term borrowing balances and lower average invested cash balances this fiscal year was an increase in net interest expense 
other income decreased due to decreased equity in income of affiliates  which are also in the shell egg business 
last year we recorded a gain on the sale of the fixed assets at our albuquerque feed mill 
we did not have a similar fixed asset sale this fiscal year

our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which are outside of our control 
small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices 
egg supply has been better balanced with demand resulting in favorable egg market conditions 
according to statistics from the usda  the number of table egg laying hens was down from the previous year  which added continued support in balancing supply and demand in the shell egg market 
an improved balance of supply and demand  led to higher average shell egg selling prices throughout the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the previous year

future funding is expected to be provided by our cash balances and borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
capital expenditure requirements are expected to be for the normal repair and replacement of our facilities 
we are constructing a new integrated layer production complex in farwell  tx to replace our albuquerque  new mexico complex  which ceased egg production in fiscal the expected cost is approximately million 
completion of this facility was estimated to be in january as of may  capital expenditures related to construction of this complex totaled million 
the remaining future capital expenditures will be funded by cash flows from operations  existing lines of credit and additional long term borrowings 
on july  the company s egg complex in farwell  texas  was damaged by a fire 
the acre facility includes a processing plant  feed mill  two pullet houses  and nine layer houses 
the fire completely destroyed four of the nine layer houses  with additional loss of laying hens at a fifth house due to smoke inhalation 
there were no personal injuries and minimal physical damage was sustained to the rest of the complex 
prior to the fire  the farwell complex could house up to million laying hens and accounted for approximately three to four percent of the company s weekly production 
this facility  as well as all of the company s other facilities  are fully insured for their replacement value  including the estimated loss of production 
it is too early to estimate the total amount of gain or loss that will ultimately be recognized due to this fire 
based on preliminary estimates  the company has determined that the net book value of plant  and equipment lost due to this casualty is approximately million 
the company believes that this will have minimal financial impact on our operations and do not expect any long term disruption to our customers 
due to this casualty  estimated completion time for this facility will probably be delayed by an additional year to january delta egg farm  llc  an unconsolidated affiliate  is constructing an organic egg production and distribution facility near our chase  kansas location 
the cost of construction is estimated to be approximately million 
in connection with this project  we are a pro rata guarantor  with the other delta egg farm  llc owners  of additional debt undertaken to fund construction of this facility 
we are currently a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of delta egg farm  llc 
on august   ubs agreed to a settlement in principle with the securities and exchange commission  the new york attorney general  the massachusetts securities division  the texas state securities board and other state regulatory agencies represented by the north american securities administrators association to restore liquidity to all remaining ubs clients who hold auction rate securities 
on november   we agreed to accept auction rate security rights the rights from ubs offered through a ubs prospectus dated october  the rights permit us to sell  or put  our auction rate securities back to ubs at par value at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to exercise our rights and put our auction rate securities back to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the rights 
by accepting the rights  we can no longer assert that we have the intent to hold the auction rate securities until anticipated recovery 
accordingly  we have classified our investments in auction rate securities as trading securities  as defined by fas no 
 on the date of our acceptance of the rights 
as a result  we are required to record these securities at fair value each period until the rights are exercised and the auction rate securities are redeemed 
at may  the fair value of our auction rate securities was million below par value of which the entire amount has been charged to operations in fiscal because we will be permitted to put the auction rate securities back to ubs at par value  we have accounted for the rights as a separate asset that is measured at its fair value  resulting in gains in fiscal in an amount equal to the loss recognized on the auction rate securities 
although the rights represent the right to sell the securities back to ubs at par  we will periodically assess the economic ability of ubs to meet that obligation in assessing the fair value of the rights 
we will continue to classify the auction rate securities and the related rights as long term investments until june   one year prior to the expected settlement 
since our last fiscal year  ended may   we have liquidated two of our auction rate securities at par 
on july   we liquidated one auction rate security at par value for million with accrued interest after this security was called by the original issuer 
on january   ubs redeemed a million auction rate security at par with accrued interest after this security was called by the issuer 
the company entered into and borrowed proceeds under a revolving line of credit with ubs 
this revolving line of credit is collateralized by auction rate securities in our account with ubs 
as of may   the balance owed under this revolving line of credit was million 
this revolving line of credit is a net no cost loan 
thus  the interest expense on this revolving line of credit is equal to the interest income we receive on the auction rate securities held in our account 
this loan becomes due and payable as the auction rate securities are liquidated 
attributable to this payback feature  we have classified the entire amount owed under this revolving line of credit as long term debt  since the auction rate securities that collateralize this debt are correspondingly classified as long term assets 
assets measured at fair value effective june   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and expands on required disclosures about fair value measurement 
the adoption of fas for our financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
fas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under fas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
fas classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level we classified our current investment securities available for sale as level these securities consist of pre funded municipal bonds and certificates of deposit with maturities of three to six months  when purchased 
due to the nature of these securities they are reported at cost  which approximates fair value based upon quoted prices for similar assets in active markets 
observable inputs for these securities are yields  credit risks  default rates  and volatility 
level we classified our long term investment securities trading  which consist of auction rate securities  as level our auction rate securities consist of two types formulaic muni auction rate securities and student loan auction rate securities 
the formulaic muni auction rate securities are municipal securities whose maximum rates are generally based on an index multiplied by a percentage which is based on the rating of the security 
the student loan auction rate securities are securities issued by student loan trusts 
for the formulaic muni auction rate securities  the observable inputs include credit risk  and yields or spreads of fixed rate municipal bonds issued by the same or comparable issuers 
the unobservable input for the formulaic muni auction rate securities is the assessment of the likelihood of redemption 
for the student loan auction rate securities  the observable inputs include  tax status  credit risk  duration  insurance wraps  and the portfolio composition  future cash flows based on maximum rate formulas  and estimates of observable market data including yields or spreads of trading instruments that are similar of comparable 
the unobservable input for the student loan auction rate securities are the likelihood of redemption 
due to the combination of observable and unobservable inputs  we believe that level is the proper classification

 establishing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities fas  to permit all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
we adopted fas effective june  we have elected the fair value option for our auction rate security rights 
we agreed to accept these auction rate security rights from ubs on november  we currently have a million deferred tax liability due to a subsidiary s change from a cash basis to an accrual basis taxpayer on may  the taxpayer relief act of provides that this liability is payable ratably over the years beginning in fiscal however  such taxes will be due in their entirety in the first fiscal year in which there is a change in ownership control so that we no longer qualify as a family farming corporation 
we are currently making annual payments of approximately related to this liability 
however  while these current payments reduce cash balances  payment of the million deferred tax liability would not impact our consolidated statement of income or stockholders equity  as these taxes have been accrued and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
looking forward  we believe that our current cash balances  borrowing capacity  utilization of our revolving line of credit  and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our current and projected capital needs in light of the disruptions in the financial markets 
these disruptions in the financial markets include among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
in light of the current tightening of credit in the financial markets  we might suffer adverse affects in so far as our ability to secure financing in the future  including  if necessary  to fund a strategic acquisition  and our ability to refinance any of our long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements the company owns of the membership interest in delta egg farm  llc delta egg 
the company is a guarantor of of delta egg s long term debt  which totaled approximately million at may  delta egg s long term debt is secured by substantially all fixed assets of delta egg and is due in monthly installments through fiscal delta egg is engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs 
the other owner also guarantees of the debt 
the guarantee arose when delta egg borrowed funds to construct its production and processing facility in the guarantee would be required if delta egg is not able to pay the debt 
management of the company believes this possibility is unlikely because delta egg is now well capitalized 
on july   this debt was refinanced for a term of ten years 
there were additional borrowings under this refinancing due to the construction of an organic egg production and distribution facility near  chase  kansas costing approximately million

among other requirements  this statement requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statement  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
fas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   which will begin with our fiscal year

 subsequent events fas 
fas establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
this statement does not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable generally accepted accounting principles that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions 
fas would apply to both interim financial statements and annual financial statements and should not result in significant changes in the subsequent events that are reported 
fas introduces the concept of financial statements being available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which a company has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  whether that represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
fas should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
this statement is effective for interim or annual reporting periods ending after june   which corresponds to the company s first quarter of fiscal in june  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r fas 
fas is a revision to fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  and changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance 
fas will require a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
a reporting entity will be required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entity s financial statements 
fas will be effective at the start of a reporting entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  this statement is effective for the company in fiscal early application is not permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of adoption of fas on its financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas establishes the fasb accounting standards codificationtm codification as the single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
fas and the codification are effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september   which corresponds to the company s second quarter of fiscal when effective  the codification will supersede all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become nonauthoritative 
following fas  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  the fasb will issue accounting standards updates  which will serve only to a update the codification  b provide background information about the guidance  and c provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
the adoption of fas will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management suggests that our summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  generally for amounts more than days past due 
inventories 
inventories of eggs  feed  supplies and livestock are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower  we would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value 
the cost associated with flock inventories  consisting principally of chick purchases  feed  labor  contractor payments and overhead costs  are accumulated during the growing period of approximately weeks 
capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the productive lives of the flocks  generally one to two years 
flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal adjustments to write down flock inventories 
management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss 
long lived assets 
depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
we continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
investment in affiliates 
we have invested in other companies engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from less than to 
therefore  these investments are recorded using the cost or the equity method  and accordingly  not consolidated in our financial statements 
changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used 
our investment in these companies amounted to million at may  the combined total assets and total liabilities of these companies were approximately million and million  respectively  at may  we are a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of one of the affiliates 
goodwill 
at may   our goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill relates to the following fiscal period description amount acquisition of hudson brothers  inc acquisition of hillandale farms  llc acquisition of green forest foods  llc revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale acquisition of zephyr egg  llc acquisition of tampa farms  llc total goodwill we adopted  as of june   statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
an impairment loss would be recorded if the recorded goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we have only one operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment at the entity level 
significant adverse industry or economic changes  or other factors not anticipated could result in an impairment charge to reduce recorded goodwill 
income taxes 
we determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we are periodically audited by taxing authorities 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate 
forward looking statements 
the foregoing statements contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties and our actual experience may differ materially from that discussed above 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors affecting future performance below  as well as future events that have the effect of reducing our available cash balances  such as unanticipated operating losses or capital expenditures related to possible future acquisitions 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update forward looking statements 
factors affecting future performance 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors which are beyond our control 
these include adverse changes in shell egg prices and in the grain markets 
accordingly  past trends should not be used to anticipate future results and trends 
further  our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we maintain certain of our debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a adverse move decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the net fair value of our debt by million at may  on august   ubs agreed to a settlement in principle with the securities and exchange commission  the new york attorney general  the massachusetts securities division  the texas state securities board and other state regulatory agencies represented by the north american securities administrators association to restore liquidity to all remaining ubs clients who hold auction rate securities 
on november   we agreed to accept auction rate security rights the rights from ubs offered through a prospectus filed on october  the rights permit us to sell  or put  our auction rate securities back to ubs at par value at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to exercise our rights and put our auction rate securities back to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the rights 
by accepting the rights  we can no longer assert that we have the intent to hold the auction rate securities until anticipated recovery 
accordingly  we have classified our investments in auction rate securities as trading securities  as defined by fas no 
 on the date of our acceptance of the rights 
as a result  we are required to record these securities at fair value each period until the rights are exercised and the auction rate securities are redeemed 
at may  the fair value of our auction rate securities was  below par value of which the entire amount has been charged to operations in fiscal because we will be permitted to put the auction rate securities back to ubs at par value  we have accounted for the rights as a separate asset that is measured at its fair value  resulting in gains in fiscal in an amount equal to the loss recognized on the auction rate securities 
although the rights represent the right to sell the securities back to ubs at par  we will periodically assess the economic ability of ubs to meet that obligation in assessing the fair value of the rights 
we will continue to classify the auction rate securities and the related rights as long term investments until june   one year prior to the expected settlement 
our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
small increases in production or small decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices 
feed costs represent the largest element of our shell egg production farm cost  ranging from to of total farm annual cost in each of the last five fiscal years 
although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources  we have little  if any  control over the prices of the ingredients that we purchase  which are affected by various demand and supply factors and have experienced significant fluctuations in the past 
we are a party to no other market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
