item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting  providing our stockholders with informative disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial position and operating results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with management s perspective on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results 
md a is presented in the following sections overview critical accounting policies and estimates results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements global market and economic conditions off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations recent accounting developments overview beckman coulter is the world s largest company devoted solely to biomedical testing  a market we estimate had about billion in worldwide sales in we market our products in more than countries  with approximately half of our revenue in coming from outside the united states 
our strategy is to extend the company s leadership in simplifying  automating and innovating customer s processes  by continuing to rollout new products  enhance our current product offerings and enter into new and growing market segments

the majority of our revenue is generated from consumable supplies including reagent test kits  service and operating type lease otl payment arrangements 
approximately of our total revenue in was generated by this type of revenue  which we refer to as recurring revenue 
a customer contract typically runs five years while the average customer relationship lasts more than years 
switching instrument systems creates significant costs for labs changing suppliers means re training staff on new systems and performing validation studies to assure consistency of reported results 
as a result  high retention rates have driven recurring revenue near 
our remaining balance of revenue is derived from instrument sales 
in  we revised our presentation in the consolidated statement of earnings to better reflect our main sources of revenue recurring revenue and instrument sales 
accordingly  we have reclassified amounts reported in prior years to conform to our current year presentation 
our instruments are mainly provided to customers under cash sales or otl arrangements 
since mid  most of our leases have been otls rather than sales type leases stls  which we previously utilized 
our otls are provided under bundled lease arrangements  in which our customers pay a monthly amount for the equipment  consumable supplies including reagent test kits  and service 
our lease arrangements primarily take the form of what are known as reagent rentals where an instrument is placed at a customer location and the customer commits to purchase a certain minimum volume of reagents annually 
we also enter into metered contracts with customers where the instrument is placed at a customer location with a stock of reagents and the customer is billed monthly based on actual reagent usage 
through  we operated our business on the basis of a single reportable segment 
beginning in the first fiscal quarter of  we began to measure our business on the basis of two reportable segments clinical diagnostics and life science 
segment revenue and profit information is presented in note business segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  including comparable information for prior years 
within our clinical diagnostics segment  we have identified three product areas  each focused on a core product strategy chemistry and clinical automation  cellular analysis  and immunoassay and molecular diagnostics 
our clinical diagnostics segment represents about of our total revenues  while the life science segment generates the remaining of total revenues 
for a description of the components of these segments see the comprehensive product portfolio chart in company profile in item of this form k 
placements of products serving the clinical diagnostics markets have been experiencing growth as test volumes continue to increase as a result of factors such as an aging population  increasing expenditures on chronic diseases  conditions requiring ongoing treatment for example  diabetes  aids and cancer and greater acceptance of modern medicine in emerging countries 
our customers are faced with increasing volumes of testing  a shrinking skilled labor pool and constant pressure to contain costs 
consequently  it has become essential for manufacturers to provide cost effective systems to remain competitive 
a large number of the products in the life science segment are dependent on academic research funding and capital spending in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical and clinical research markets 
bec form k 
table of contents products such as the unicel dxi access immunoassay system  the unicel dxc and synchron clinical chemistry systems and the automate front end automation system provide our customers with a means to increase efficiency through automation and workstation consolidation 
we believe these industry leading  high throughput systems have positioned us to gain market share and increase streams of recurring revenue in subsequent years 
to further the potential of these systems  we are developing new tests internally  collaborating with external parties and pursuing business and technology acquisitions 
in hematology  we continue to automate more of the testing process with recently introduced next generation systems to serve high volume hospital labs 
recurring revenue has historically allowed us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we have used this cash flow in the past to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products through internal development as well as business and technology acquisitions 
our otls require additional investment and increased capital expenditures 
we expect our operating cash flows to build as the operating lease payments associated with our otl portfolio builds 
our investment in customer leased instruments should continue to build over the next eighteen months and then grow more moderately 
in order to continue to grow  gain market share and remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new instrument and reagent technologies and remain at the forefront in helping customers advance medical science  improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs 
to remain competitive we also must acquire and defend intellectual property and invest in research and development r d 
otherwise  our current products could become technologically obsolete over time 
a large number of our products require marketing authorizations from the fda and similar agencies in other countries 
we believe that we have effective quality and compliance programs in place and have been successful in obtaining the necessary clearances for our new products from the fda and other similar agencies 
supply chain initiatives in january  as part of our previously announced strategic supply chain management initiatives to improve productivity and reduce operating costs  we announced certain outsourcing initiatives and manufacturing site relocations  including our intention to close our manufacturing site in palo alto  california and relocate those operations to indianapolis  indiana 
during  as a result of these initiatives  we announced the closure and relocation of other manufacturing and distribution sites  mainly in the united states 
in connection with these activities  we recorded charges of million and million for severance  retention  asset impairments  duplicative and other costs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our palo alto relocation is targeted to provide an annual benefit of approximately million in  increasing to million to the extent we are able to sublease the facility 
ongoing efforts to consolidate operations and exit buildings allowed us to reduce our space requirements by approximately  square feet in in our efforts to maximize the productivity of our people and our assets we began plans to consolidate our orange county  california operations currently located in fullerton and brea  california 
plans for this consolidation were developed in and are expected to be completed by the end of for  we recorded charges of million for severance  asset impairments  and other related costs related to the orange county consolidation project as well as million in environmental remediation obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
to prepare our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
we describe our significant accounting policies in note  nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are important to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit finance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  when collectibility is reasonably assured and when risk of loss transfers 
for instrument sales that include customer specific acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized when the acceptance criteria have been met 
when a customer enters into an otl agreement  lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  while the cost of the leased equipment is carried in customer leased instruments within property  plant and equipment and depreciated over its estimated useful life 
under an stl agreement  hardware revenue and related costs are generally recognized at the time of shipment based on the present value of the minimum lease payments with interest income recognized over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
supplies and test kit revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery or usage 
service revenue on maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement or as service is performed  if not under contract 
bec form k 
table of contents for those stl and sale agreements that include multiple deliverables  such as installation  training  after market supplies or service  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components 
the fair market value of our leased instruments is determined by a range of cash selling prices or other verifiable objective evidence  if applicable 
we regularly evaluate available objective evidence of instrument fair values using historical data 
our allocation of revenue for future sales could be affected by changes in estimates of the relative fair value of the various deliverables which could affect the timing of our revenue recognition or allocation to the various components 
our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for leases sfas  as amended  which often involves complex provisions and significant judgments 
before classifying a lease as an stl  among other things  we assess whether collectibility of the lease payment is reasonably assured and whether there are any significant uncertainties related to costs that we have yet to incur with respect to the lease 
generally  our leases that qualify as stls are non cancelable leases with a term of percent or more of the economic life of the equipment 
in  we changed our standard leasing terms around cancellation provisions to emphasize terms which meet the criteria for otl classification 
this primarily affected the united states 
as a result  nearly all of our lease arrangements are otls 
certain of our lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are determined by analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and applying an estimated loss rate to the aging of the remaining accounts receivable balances 
this estimated loss rate is based on our historical loss experience but also contemplates current market conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory cost 
inventory schedules are analyzed quarterly by finance and logistics personnel  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
a significant decrease in forecasted demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory reserves or write downs and increased cost of sales 
customer leased instruments the economic life of our leased instruments require significant accounting estimates and judgment 
these estimates are based on our historical experience 
the most objective measure of the economic life of our leased instrument is the original term of a lease  which is typically five years  since a majority of the instruments are returned by the lessee at or near the end of the lease term and there is not a significant after market for our used instruments without substantial remanufacturing 
we believe that this is representative of the period during which the instrument is expected to be economically usable  with normal service  for the purpose for which it is intended 
we regularly evaluate the economic life of existing and new products for purposes of this determination 
valuation of other long lived assets the process of evaluating the potential impairment of other long lived assets such as our property  plant and equipment  including software for internal use  is subjective and requires judgment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the usefulness of the asset and consider market factors specific to the business which the asset is used in and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
furthermore  we may determine that our assets have a shorter useful life than our current estimate  which would result in higher depreciation and amortization expense 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in these assumptions and estimates could materially impact our future reported financial results 
bec form k 
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
for goodwill  we compare the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the assets are assigned 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and potential impairment charges related to goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should conditions be different from management s estimate at the time of acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we make assessments of impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
environmental obligations our compliance with federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations may require us to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances in jurisdictions where we do business or maintain properties 
we establish accruals when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
accrual amounts are estimated based on currently available information  regulatory requirements  remediation strategies  historical experience  our relative share of the total remediation costs and a relevant discount rate  when the time period of estimated costs can be reasonably predicted 
changes in these assumptions could impact our future reported results 
legal obligations we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters which we consider to be normal for our type of business operations 
we record accruals for resolution of legal matters when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as a global company active in a wide range of biomedical sciences  we may  in the normal course of our business become involved in proceedings relating to matters such as patent validity and infringement disputes  contractual obligations  and employment and other regulatory matters 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any proceedings in which we are or may become involved 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking damages from us could result in a monetary award to the plaintiff and  to the extent not covered by our insurance policies or third party indemnities  could significantly affect the results of our operations 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking an injunction or other similar relief also could significantly affect our business operations 
if we lose a case in which we seek to enforce our patent rights  we could sustain a loss of future revenue as other manufacturers begin to market products based on intellectual property we developed 
litigation cases and claims raise difficult and complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities  including  but not limited to  the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim  the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought  and differences in applicable law 
upon resolution of any pending legal matters  we may incur charges in excess of presently established provisions and related insurance or third party coverage 
it is possible that our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation 
although  we believe that our provisions are appropriate and in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies sfas  changes in events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  profitability or liquidity 
income taxes we record liabilities for potential income tax assessments based on our estimate of potential tax related exposures using the criteria established in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
these assessments require significant judgment as uncertainties often exist in interpretations of new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by multiple taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
changes in our estimates could have a material effect on our effective income tax rate in the period 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and for tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
an increase or decrease to net earnings may occur if we were to determine that we were able to utilize more or less of these deferred tax assets than currently expected

table of contents in the fourth quarter of the us congress enacted legislation extending the federal research experimentation r e tax credit for the and tax years 
as a result  an estimated r e credit of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the financial statements include the benefit for the and r e tax credit 
in prior years  due to the difficulty in estimating an r e credit on a current basis  we used a method to record the r e tax credit for financial reporting purposes  which resulted in recognizing the benefit in the year subsequent to the credit utilization on its tax return 
the prior method used to record the r e tax credit did not have a material impact on any of the financial statements presented 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor pension plans in various forms  and a postretirement medical benefit plan which covers us employees and retirees who met certain eligibility criteria at the end of the obligations under these plans are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based upon a number of factors which are used to determine the expense  liabilities and asset values related to the plans 
two of the critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
other important assumptions include expected future salary increases  retirement dates  employee turnover  mortality rates and the health care cost trend rate 
we review these assumptions annually 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based upon historical cumulative returns on plan assets  the investment strategy  plan asset allocation and expected returns 
while there is no absolute predictor of future performance  our historical return on plan assets has been over 
we believe our expected long term rate of return assumption  which is used to calculate pension expense  of in and in and  is reasonable based on our investment strategy and our long term investment return experience 
we froze entrance to the pension plan effective december  and changed the investment allocation in december to reduce the volatility of changes in the fair value of plan assets 
however  the value of our pension plan assets declined significantly in as a result of the overall economic decline 
we expect to reduce our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to in and expect our pension plan expense to increase  as described further under global market and economic conditions 
the discount rate is an assumption used to determine the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to the services rendered by participants in our pension plans 
the rate used reflects our best estimate of the rate at which pension benefits will be effectively settled considering the timing of expected payments to plan participants 
the discount rates are developed based on benchmarking indexes 
the benchmarking indexes are obtained by using high quality long term corporate bond yields currently available with terms similar to the expected timing of payments to be made under our pension obligation 
due to the recent  unprecedented events in the financial markets associated with the current credit environment  there is a greater than usual disparity in yields among the bonds included in the various indices used to determine our pension discount rates 
given this disparity  we carefully evaluated our existing methodologies for determining our pension discount rates 
we are no longer indexing our discount rate to the moody s aa bond yield 
instead  the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for the us pension plan and postretirement plans was selected by the company  in consultation with its independent actuaries  using an average of pension discount yield curves based on the characteristics of the us plan and postretirement liabilities  each determined independently 
the weighted average discount rate we utilized to measure our us pension obligation as of december  and to calculate our expense was in comparison to used in determining our expense 
for all other non us pension plans  the company set the assumed discount rates based on the nature of liabilities  local economic environments and available bond indices 
changes in the expected long term rate of return on assets eltra or discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligation and related pension expense

table of contents share based compensation sfas r share based payments sfas r  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors 
share based payments include stock options  employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  restricted stock and performance shares 
share based compensation expense is based on the value of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model which incorporates various assumptions  including volatility  expected life and interest rates to estimate the fair value of stock options 
the expected life is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and forfeitures of stock options by our employees 
we use a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience 
we evaluate and adjust our assumptions on an annual basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
results of operations management reviews revenue by segment  product area  markets we serve and major geographic area 
to facilitate our understanding of results  we review revenue on both a reported and constant currency basis 
we define constant currency revenue as current period revenue in local currency translated to us dollars at the prior year s foreign currency exchange rate for that period  computed monthly 
constant currency growth is defined as current period constant currency revenue less prior year reported revenue divided by prior year reported revenue 
this measure provides information on revenue growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior year and the current period 
we believe the use of this measure aids in the understanding of our operations without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
this presentation is also consistent with our internal use of the measure  which we use to measure the profitability of ongoing operating results against prior periods and against our internally developed targets 
constant currency revenue and constant currency growth as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  these measures are not us gaap defined measures  and therefore not an alternative measure of revenue or revenue growth on a us gaap basis

table of contents executive summary total revenue increased to billion  an increase of in constant currency compared to this increase was primarily due to a in constant currency increase in instrument sales 
additionally  recurring revenue  which we believe is the best indicator of the overall strength of our business  grew in constant currency to billion 
the continued build up of lease payments and growth of highly profitable supplies and test kit revenue delivered strong recurring revenue gains during the year 
recurring revenue represented approximately of our total revenue during our flow cytometry acquisition contributed to our overall revenue growth of 
clinical diagnostics recurring revenue growth of  or in constant currency  was diluted by a constant currency growth in recurring revenue from life science 
we continued progress in extending our installed base  as reflected in instrument sales growth of more than compared to however  we experienced a decline in instrument sales during the fourth quarter  due in part  to a weakness in life science and a stronger us dollar 
while we anticipate that continued strength of the us dollar will negatively impact our future instrument sales  we expect our steady gains in recurring revenue  which represents nearly of our total revenue  to provide a predictable source of earnings expansion and cash flow 
gross profit margin decreased basis points to  largely due to higher transportation costs and elevated sales of lower margin cash instruments sales internationally 
the increase in instrument sales and continued expansion of our international installed base put downward pressure on margins  but supports our long term objective to increase penetration into international and particularly emerging markets which we believe will drive future recurring revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense grew during the current year due in part to incremental expense from our flow cytometry acquisition  additional infrastructure investments in developing markets and additional marketing support for new products 
r d expense increased as we funded significant r d programs delivering four new work cells and our next generation cellular analysis system 
investment in our molecular diagnostics program was also expanded  as we acquired licenses for additional tests 
during  we incurred a million charge related to the acquisition of a sub license to receive certain patent rights to testing for the hepatitis c virus along with an million charge in connection with buying out our future us royalty for preeclampsia tests from nephromics llc 
prior year r d expenses were higher than normal due to the acquisition of nexgen and to the related in process r d charge of million in we recorded a million environmental remediation charge during the year  related to our orange county consolidation project 
in connection with this consolidation  we began conducting environmental studies at our fullerton  california site 
the data generated by these studies indicates that soil and groundwater at the site contain chemicals previously used in operations at the facility 
the million represents our best estimate at this time of future expenditures for investigation and remediation at the site 
the ultimate costs may range from million to million 
non operating expense was million during  whereas non operating income in the prior year was driven by non recurring gains 
this included a million breakup fee received in connection with a termination agreement with biosite  incorporated and a gain of million related to our miami land sale  partially offset by a million contribution made to establish a foundation 
excluding these items in  the increase in non operating expense was primarily due to higher currency related expense 
our effective tax rate decreased to from during  primarily due to additional r e tax credits  certain discrete items and a shift in the geographic mix  with more income earned outside the us in lower tax jurisdictions

excluding the effect of these transactions  other non operating expense increased over the prior year primarily due to currency related costs

the additional gain on sale of million million net of taxes  was recorded in discontinued operations during income tax income tax as a percentage of pretax earnings from continuing operations was in compared with in our effective tax rate in was lower than the united states federal statutory rate due primarily to shift in geographic profit mix with more income earned outside the us in lower tax jurisdictions  various tax credits  including r e tax credits  the deduction allowed for us tax purposes related to manufacturing activities in the us  and expiration of the statute of limitations for which resulted in a million reduction in tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for that year 
additional r e tax credits of million were recorded in to record the credits in the year earned  whereas previously we recorded r e credits in the following year due to difficulties in estimating credits 
total r e tax credits recorded in were million million for credits and million for credits  whereas r e credits recorded in were million related to credits 
income tax as a percentage of pretax earnings from continuing operations in was negatively impacted by several items as follows establishment of a joint intercompany research and development program in ireland  which is expected to also negatively impact our tax rate over the next couple of years  but yield a lower tax rate in the long term and an adjustment to prior years deferred taxes of million related to pension deferred tax assets 
see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a reconciliation of the us statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate 
we expect the effective tax rate in to be higher than due to a change in geographical profit mix with more income expected to be earned in higher tax jurisdictions such as the us however  our effective tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors including  but not limited to  enactments of new tax laws  new interpretations of existing tax laws  rulings by and settlements with taxing authorities  our generation of tax credits  including r e tax credits and our geographic profit mix

income tax as a percentage of pretax earnings from continuing operations in was negatively impacted by several items as follows geographic profit mix  increase in state income taxes  no extraterritorial income exclusion eie in the united states due to its expiration as of december   and tax law changes in certain foreign countries which impacted the deferred tax assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert those assets that are no longer required in meeting existing strategic and financing objectives into cash 
therefore  for purposes of achieving long range business objectives and meeting our commitments  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds 
our business model  in particular recurring revenue comprised of consumable supplies including reagent test kits  service  and otl payments  allows us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we continue to invest a substantial portion of this cash flow in instruments leased to customers 
we expect operating cash flows to increase as our revenue and depreciation from new otls increase year over year

in october  our wholly owned subsidiary  beckman coulter finance company  llc bcfc  a delaware limited liability company  entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with several financial institutions 
the securitization facility is on a day revolving basis 
as part of the securitization program  we transferred our interest in a defined pool of accounts receivable to bcfc 
in turn  bcfc sold ownership interest in the underlying receivables to the multi seller conduits administered by a third party bank 
sale of receivables under the program is accounted for as a secured borrowing 
the cost of funds under this program varies based on changes in interest rates 
on october   we amended the accounts receivable securitization program to extend the term of the agreement from october  to october  as well as reduce the maximum borrowing amount from million to million 
we did not have any amounts drawn on the facility as of december  in december  we issued million of convertible notes 
proceeds were used to repurchase million senior notes due in  repay our bridge loan used to finance the acquisition of lumigen and to repay million of our outstanding credit facility

capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities  as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
global market and economic conditions global market and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile  and in recent months the volatility has reached unprecedented levels 
concerns about the systemic impact of geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  currency volatility  signs of slowing global economies  the united states mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us and elsewhere have contributed to the increased market volatility as well as diminished expectations for the united states and world economies 
these conditions  combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to the market volatility 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  or in some cases cease  to provide funding to borrowers 
the economic conditions also might impact counterparties ability to perform under existing hedging agreements 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers and suppliers 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our customers and suppliers  to replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
it also may affect our ability to issue and the terms of equity and debt capital 
the disruptions in the equity and credit markets  as mentioned above  have resulted in depressed security values in most types of investment and non investment grade bonds and debt obligations and mortgage and asset backed securities  as well as the failure of the auction mechanism for certain of those asset backed securities 
our pension plans invest in a variety of equity and debt bec form k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange and interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this analysis is constrained by several factors  including the following it is based on a single point in time  and it does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the changes modeled 
although the results of the analysis may be useful as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and chinese renminbi 
as of december  and  the notional amounts of all derivative foreign exchange contracts were million and million  respectively 
notional amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents at the spot exchange rate at the respective dates 
the net fair values of all derivative foreign exchange contracts as of december  and  were a net asset of million and net liability of million  respectively 
we estimated the sensitivity of the fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts to a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the spot exchange rates for the us dollar against the foreign currencies at december  the analysis showed that a strengthening of the us dollar would result in a gain from a fair value change of million and a weakening of the us dollar would result in a loss from a fair value change of million in these instruments 
losses and gains on the underlying transactions being hedged would largely offset any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
similarly  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our variable rate debt instruments and derivatives 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to decrease or increase our pre tax earnings by million based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  additional information with respect to our foreign currency and interest rate exposures are discussed in note derivatives of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial risk management our risk management program  developed by senior management and approved by the board of directors  seeks to minimize the potentially negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on the results of operations 
our primary exposures to fluctuations in the financial markets are to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk arises because our reporting currency is the us dollar and we generate approximately of our revenue in various foreign currencies 
us dollar denominated costs and expenses as a percentage of total operating costs and expenses are much greater than us dollar denominated revenue as a percentage of total net revenue 
as a result  appreciation of the us dollar against our major trading currencies has a negative impact on our results of operations  and depreciation of the us dollar against such currencies has a positive impact 
the dollar strengthened since the first half of  therefore the impact of the strengthening dollar will be more pronounced in the first half of than in the second half of  based upon current rates 
we seek to minimize our exposure to changes in exchange rates by denominating costs and expenses in foreign currencies 
when these opportunities are exhausted  we use derivative financial instruments to function as hedges 
we use forward contracts and purchased option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated transactions based on prior year rates 
we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the major currencies against which we hedge are the euro  japanese yen  australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and chinese renminbi 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises out of our long term debt obligations 
inflation we continually monitor inflation and the effects of changing prices 
inflation increases the cost of goods and services used 
competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets restrict our ability to fully recover the higher costs of acquired goods and services through price increases 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation by implementing continuous process improvement solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency and  as a result  lower costs and operating expenses 
the effects of inflation have  in our opinion  been managed appropriately and as a result have not had a material impact on our operations and the resulting financial position or liquidity
