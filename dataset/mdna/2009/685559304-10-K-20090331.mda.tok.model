item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of ics which was acquired effective december  although the company recorded excellent operating results in its fourth quarter before the goodwill impairment charge  the company recorded a decrease in operating results for the year ended december  in addition  after completing its impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets  the company recorded an impairment charge of  at december  although sales increased by  this increase was principally attributable to the inclusion ics in the current period 
exclusive of ics  net sales would have decreased by approximately principally due to decreased sales from our instrument division and tulip and despite increased sales from our power group 
gross profit margins decreased slightly for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
due to lower gross margins  higher selling  general and administrative expenses and lower investment and other income  net income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the prior year exclusive of the aforementioned goodwill impairment charge and a  and  other than temporary impairment loss in our corporate bond portfolio for the current year and prior year  respectively 
inclusive of these one time charges  net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to net income of  in the prior year 
our backlog at december  was approximately  compared to  at december  there is no seasonality to the company s business 
our shipping schedules are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from our customers 
both of our operating segments are pursuing a significant amount of business opportunities and our confidence level remains high with respect to receiving many of the orders we are pursuing  although timing is always an uncertainty 
our success of the past few years has significantly strengthened our balance sheet evidenced by our to current ratio at december  we currently have a  credit facility in place 
as a result of lower profitability related to customer shipping delays in the first and second quarter of  the company was not in compliance with two of its financial covenants at september  in november  the company s primary lender waived the covenant default of two of its financial ratios at september  and the company renegotiated the financial covenant ratios for the quarterly reporting periods december  and march  beginning june   the covenants will revert back to their original ratios with a modification to a certain financial ratio covenant definition 
the company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants at december  in august  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing it to purchase up to million of its outstanding shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the period from august through december   the company repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  from august through march   the company purchased approximately  shares of its common stock for total cash consideration of  representing an average price of per share

such forward looking statements are based on our best estimates of future results  performance or achievements  based on current conditions and the most recent results of the company 
in addition to statements which explicitly describe such risks and uncertainties  readers are urged to consider statements labeled with the terms may  will  potential  opportunity  believes  belief  expects  intends  estimates  anticipates or plans to be uncertain and forward looking 
the forward looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the company s reports and registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations are based on the company s financial statements and the data used to prepare them 
the company s financial statements have been prepared based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventory valuation  the valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax asset  goodwill impairment  valuation of share based compensation  revenue and cost recognition on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and other than temporary impairment on marketable securities 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current business conditions and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost specific  average and first in  first out basis or market 
inventory items are reviewed regularly for excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for the company s products can be forecasted based on current backlog  customer options to reorder under existing contracts  the need to retrofit older units and parts needed for general repairs 
although the company makes every effort to insure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have an impact on the level of obsolete material in its inventory and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
however  world events have forced our country into various situations of conflict whereby equipment is used and parts may be needed for repair 
this could lead to increased product demand as well as the use of some older inventory items that the company had previously deemed to be obsolete 
deferred tax asset at december   the company had an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  with no limitation on the carry forward period and federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively that expire through approximately   of federal net operating loss carry forwards expire between in addition  the company receives a tax deduction when their employees exercise their non qualified stock options thereby increasing the company s deferred tax asset 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that a portion of the amount may not be realized 
the company estimates its valuation allowance based on an estimated forecast of its future profitability 
any significant changes in future profitability resulting from variations in future revenues or expenses could affect the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
due to the company s decrease in profitability in and a weakening economy that could affect certain portions of its business  the company decreased its projection for profitability for future periods and decreased its estimate of probability that it will attain those profit levels  thereby increasing its valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset 
impairment of goodwill the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
in determining the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  assumptions are made regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
after completing the impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company concluded an impairment charge should be taken at december  in connection with the recorded goodwill arising from its acquisitions made between and if estimates or their related assumptions used in the current testing change in the future  the company may be required to record further impairment charges for those assets not previously recorded 
share based compensation effective january   the company began recognizing share based compensation under sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards 
total share based compensation expense was  for the year ended december  the estimated fair value of stock options granted in were calculated using the black scholes model 
this model requires the use of input assumptions 
these assumptions include expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
revenue and cost recognition revenue and costs under larger  long term contracts are reported on the percentage of completion method 
for projects where materials have been purchased  but have not been placed in production  the costs of such materials are excluded from costs incurred for the purpose of measuring the extent of progress toward completion 
the amount of earnings recognized at the financial statement date is based on an efforts expended method  which measures the degree of completion on a contract based on the amount of labor dollars incurred compared to the total labor dollars expected to complete the contract 
when an ultimate loss is indicated on a contract  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period 
assets related to these contracts are included in current assets as they will be liquidated in the normal course of contract completion  although this may require more than one year 
other than temporary impairment the company currently has in excess of  invested in government and corporate bonds 
the company treats its investments as available for sale pursuant to sfas no 
which requires the company to assess its portfolio each reporting period to determine whether declines in fair value below book value are considered to be other than temporary 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to cost and the write down is included in earnings as a realized loss  and a new cost is established for the security 
any subsequent recovery in fair value is not recognized until the security either is sold or matures 
the company uses several factors in its determination of whether an other than temporary impairment of one of its securities has occurred including i the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  iv whether a decline in fair value is attributable to adverse conditions specifically related to the security or specific conditions in an industry and v whether interest payments continue to be made 
although the company received all its interest payments during the current year  it took an other than temporary impairment write down of  for the year ended december  consisting of bonds held in three separate issuers in which it determined the decline in fair value was due to adverse conditions specifically related to the security or specific conditions in an industry 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  the company currently operates in two industry segments 
its orbit instrument division and its tulip subsidiary are engaged in the design and manufacture of electronic components and subsystems and its ics subsidiary performs system integration for gun weapons systems and fire control interface as well as logistics support and documentation the electronics group 
its behlman subsidiary is engaged in the design and manufacture of commercial power units the power group 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include the operations of ics for the entire period since the acquisition was completed effective  december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  due to the inclusion of ics in the current period and increased sales from the power group and despite lower sales from the company s orbit instrument division and tulip subsidiary 
exclusive of ics  net sales would have decreased by approximately 
sales from the electronics group increased only by despite the inclusion of ics in the current period 
during the current period  the company s orbit instrument division resumed shipments of its remote control units rcu that had previously been placed on hold while it completed an enhanced hardware solution imposed as an additional hardware requirement by its customer 
these shipment delays had adversely impacted the first and second quarters of the resumption of these deliveries contributed to a strong fourth quarter but did not make up for the shipment shortfall of the previous quarters 
the orbit instrument division also experienced an unrelated customer delivery issue in the first quarter of that resulted in a shipment shortfall for that period  which was resolved at december  this loss of sales  along with decreased sales from the company s tulip subsidiary resulted in a slight increase in sales for the electronics group despite the inclusion of ics in the current period 
sales from the power group increased by for the current year as the segment recorded a record year of bookings and revenue 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  decreased to from for the prior year 
this decrease resulted from a lower gross profit from the company s electronics group v 
due to a decrease in sales from both the orbit instrument division and tulip 
the increase in gross profit v 
from the power group was principally due to the increase in sales and to product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  principally due to the inclusion of ics s selling  general and administrative costs of  in the current period 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  principally due to the aforementioned increase in costs that was not commensurate with the increase in sales 
after completing the impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company concluded an impairment charge of  should be taken at december  in connection with the recorded goodwill arising from its tulip and ics acquisitions made in and  respectively 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  due to an increase in the amounts owed to lenders in the current year due to the acquisition of ics effective december   that was partially offset by a reduction in interest rates 
investment and other income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the prior year principally due to a decrease in the amounts invested during the current year  a decrease in interest rates and a  other than temporary impairment loss related to certain corporate bonds held by the company 
for the year ended december   the company had a  other than temporary impairment loss related to its corporate bond portfolio 
loss before income tax provision was  for the year ended december  compared to income of  for the year ended december  this decrease was principally due to the goodwill impairment charge  a decrease in sales from both the orbit instrument division and tulip  the decrease in gross margins  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense  the decrease in investment and other income and despite the increase in sales and profitability from the power group 
income taxes for the year ended december  and december  consist of  and  respectively  in state income taxes that cannot be offset by any state net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result of the foregoing  net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to income of  for the year ended december  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  listed below is the ebitda reconciliation to net income year ended december  net loss income   interest expense   income tax expense   goodwill impairment  depreciation and amortization   ebitda   ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be construed as an alternative to net income 
an element of the company s growth strategy has been through strategic acquisitions which have been substantially funded through the issuance of debt 
this has resulted in significant interest expense and amortization expense 
ebitda is presented as additional information because the company believes it is useful to our investors and management as a measure of cash generated by our business operations that will be used to service our debt and fund future acquisitions as well as provide an additional element of operating performance 
liquidity  capital resources and inflation working capital decreased to  at december  as compared to  at december  despite the decrease in working capital  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  compared to to at december  the reduction in working capital was principally due to the repayment of long term debt and the purchase of treasury stock 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the net loss for the year  the non cash deferred income  increase in accounts receivable and inventory and decrease in accrued expenses  taxes payable and customer advances that was partially offset by the non cash goodwill impairment charge  amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and stock based compensation  the decrease in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings and amounts due from ics sellers  and an increase in accounts payable 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to net income for the period  the non cash amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and stock based compensation and the increase in accounts payable that was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory and the decrease in customer advances

cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  attributable to the acquisition of ics  the purchase of marketable securities and fixed assets that was partially offset by the sale of marketable securities 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the repayments of long term debt and purchase of treasury stock that was partially offset from loan proceeds form the line of credit

in december  the company entered into an amended  credit facility with a commercial lender secured by accounts receivable  inventory and property and equipment 
in april  the company entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of tulip tulip term loan and its manufacturing affiliate 
in december  the company entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of ics ics term loan 
in connection with the new term loan entered into in december  the interest rates on both term loan agreements and the credit facility were amended to equal a certain percentage plus the one month libor depending on a matrix related to a certain financial covenant 
the credit facility will continue from year to year unless sooner terminated for an event of default including non compliance with certain financial covenants 
principal payments under the two term loan facilities are approximately  per month 
in april  the company entered into a five year  promissory note with the selling shareholders of tulip tulip shareholder note at an interest rate of prime plus at december  
principal payments of  were made on a quarterly basis along with accrued interest 
in june  the company refinanced the balance due on the promissory note of  with its primary commercial lender 
under the terms of a new term loan  monthly payments of  will be made over a thirty month period along with accrued interest pursuant to the interest terms described below 
as a result of lower profitability related to customer shipping delays in the first and second quarter of  the company was not in compliance with two of its financial covenants at september  in november  the company entered into amended loan agreements  whereby the company s primary lender waived the covenant default of two of its financial ratios at september  and the company renegotiated the financial covenant ratios for the quarterly reporting periods december  and march  beginning june   the covenants will revert back to their original ratios with a modification to a certain financial ratio covenant definition 
the lender instituted an unused line fee of 
per annum  as a cost to the company for the waiver and amendment to the loan agreements 
in connection therewith  the interest rate on the tulip term loan and tulip shareholder note  increased to the sum of plus the one month libor and the interest rate on the ics term loan and line of credit was increased to the sum of plus the one month libor 
at december   the one month libor was equal to 
the company was in compliance with all its financial covenants at december  the company s contractual obligations and commitments are summarized as follows caption 
del less than after obligation total year years years years long term debt     note payable   employment contracts    operating leases     total contractual obligations     del 
the company s existing capital resources  including its bank credit facilities and its cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to cover the company s cash requirements for its operations 
the company believes that financing alternatives are available in order to fund future acquisitions 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing it to purchase up to million of its outstanding shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the period from august through december   the company repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  from august through march   the company purchased approximately  shares of its common stock for total cash consideration of  representing an average price of per share 
inflation has not materially impacted the operations of the company 
certain material trends during the second quarter  the company s orbit instrument division was verbally advised by one of its customers to provide support for the immediate development of certain modifications to a product for the division 
this out of scope support caused a delay in a significant amount of shipments scheduled throughout which resulted in a decrease in revenue and profitability for the division worked closely with this customer and shipment of the units resumed in the third quarter 
however  a significant number of units scheduled for shipment by december  will not be shipped until this includes certain purchase orders for this product that were expected in the third quarter but were not received until the end of the year 
in addition  the orbit instrument division also experienced an unrelated customer delivery issue in the first quarter of the current period that resulted in a shipment shortfall for that period which was resolved by year end 
these shipment delays  along with reduced revenue from the company s tulip subsidiary have had an adverse effect on the company s electronics group 
shipment delays related to engineering issues are commonplace in our industry and may  in the future  have an adverse effect on the financial performance of the company 
the power group had a record year of bookings and revenue 
the commercial division of the power group has historically been vulnerable to a weak economy 
however  bookings in the commercial division are being sustained and bookings from the custom division remain fairly strong 
however  due to current economic conditions and the possible effect on capital spending  it is uncertain that this trend will continue into in april  the company completed the acquisition of tulip and its operations became part of the company s electronics group 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of ics which also became part of the electronics group 
the company s electronics group and the custom division of its power group are heavily dependent on military spending 
the events of september   have put a tremendous emphasis on defense and homeland security spending and the company has benefited from an increasing defense budget 
although the electronics group and the custom division of the power group are pursuing several opportunities for reorders  as well as new contract awards  the company has normally found it difficult to predict the timing of such awards 
in addition  the company has an unprecedented amount of new opportunities that are in the prototype or pre production stage 
these opportunities generally move to a production stage at a later date but the timing of such is also uncertain 
there is no seasonality to the company s business 
the company s revenues are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from its customers 
the company stratifies all the opportunities it is pursuing by various confidence levels 
the company generally realizes a very high success rate with those opportunities to which it applies a high confidence level 
the company currently has a significant amount of potential contract awards to which it has applied a high confidence level 
however  because it is difficult to predict the timing of awards for most of the opportunities the company is pursuing  it is also difficult to predict when the company will commence shipping under these contracts 
a delay in the receipt of any contract from its customer ultimately causes a corresponding delay in shipments under that contract 
during and in  due to shipping schedules  the company s second half of the year was stronger than the first half 
despite the increase in military spending  the company still faces a challenging environment 
the government is emphasizing the engineering of new and improved weaponry and it continues to be our challenge to work with each of our prime contractors so that we can participate on these new programs 
in addition  these new contracts require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and pre production costs 
while the company attempts to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by its customers  including the united states government  for such effort 
in addition  even if the united states government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun that may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once the company has completed the design and pre production stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
in such event  even if the company is reimbursed its development costs it will not generate any significant profits 
the company is heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income 
however  even increased military spending does not necessarily guarantee the company increased revenues  particularly  when the allocation of budget dollars may vary depending on what may be needed for specific military conflicts any future reductions in the level of military spending by the united states government due to budget constraints or for any other reason  could have a negative impact on the company s future revenues and earnings 
in addition  due to major consolidations in the defense industry  it has become more difficult to avoid dependence on certain customers for revenue and income 
behlman s line of commercial products gives the company some diversity and the additions of tulip and ics give the electronics segment a more diversified customer base 
the company s business strategy is to expand its operations through strategic  accretive acquisitions 
through the past several years  the company reviewed various potential acquisitions and believes there are numerous opportunities presently available 
in april  it completed the acquisition of tulip and in december  it completed the acquisition of ics 
however  due to current economic conditions and tightening of credit markets  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain the necessary financing to complete additional acquisitions and even if it does  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient income from operations of such acquired companies to satisfy the interest payments  in which case  we will be required to pay them out of orbit s operations which may be adversely affected 
the company continues to review acquisition candidates but there is no assurance that an acquisition will be completed in during the second quarter of  the company expanded the activities of its investment banker to include the pursuit of alternative strategies  including the potential sale of the company as a means of enhancing shareholder value 
in june  the company terminated such activities with the investment banker but continues to pursue strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
however  there is no assurance that a sale or any of the other strategic alternatives will be accomplished
