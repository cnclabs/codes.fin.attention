item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction world heart corporation and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as worldheart 
the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations was prepared by management and discusses material changes in our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and such discussion and comments on the liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in this discussion  all amounts are in united states dollars us dollars unless otherwise stated 
overview our business is focused on the development and sale of ventricular assist devices vads  particularly our levacor rotary vad levacor vad or levacor 
vads are mechanical assist devices that supplement the circulatory function of the heart by re routing blood flow through a mechanical pump allowing for the restoration of normal blood circulation 
in the past  we derived most of our revenue from our novacor lvas and related peripheral equipment  which we sold  directly to medical clinics and hospitals in the united states  europe and canada and through a distributor in certain other countries 
the legacy generation vad  the novacor lvas  was commercially approved as a bridge to transplant device in the united states and canada 
in europe  the novacor lvas had unrestricted approval for use as an alternative to transplantation  bridge to transplantation and to support patients who may be able to recover the use of their natural heart 
in japan  the device was commercially approved for use in cardiac patients at risk of imminent death from non reversible left ventricular failure for which there was no alternative except heart transplantation 
in july  we acquired the assets of medquest products  inc medquest including a rotary vad  now called the levacor rotary vad 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we raised approximately million in gross financing proceeds from a private placement with maverick venture management  llc maverick and the exercise of certain warrants and also converted all of our remaining convertible debentures from an earlier financing 
pre clinical testing of the levacor vad was accelerated after the acquisition  with successful initial human feasibility use in europe in in november  we announced a restructuring plan  which included a reduction of commercial operations associated with the novacor lvas  and a refocusing of our resources on the development of the next generation product  particularly the levacor rotary vad 
after more than twenty years in 
table of contents clinical use  the novacor lvas has reached the natural end of its life cycle and we have been focusing on the development of the levacor rotary vad and on activities leading to the start of a us clinical trial with the levacor rotary vad in the second half of in july  we completed a million private placement transaction and recapitalization under the terms of the recapitalization agreement the recapitalization agreement dated june  and amended on july   among the corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary world heart inc whi  abiomed  inc 
abiomed  venrock partners v  lp  venrock associates v  lp and venrock entrepreneurs fund v  lp collectively  venrock  special situations fund iii qp  lp  special situations cayman fund  lp  special situations private equity fund  lp  special situations life sciences fund  lp and austin w 
marxe collectively  ssf and new leaf ventures ii  lp new leaf 
simultaneously with the closing of the recapitalization  abiomed entered into a termination and release letter agreement with us and converted the full amount of principal and interest owed on the  secured convertible promissory note the note previously issued to abiomed by us into  of our common shares the conversion  released the security interest in all of our assets that secured the note  terminated the warrant abiomed held to purchase  of our common shares  forgave other amounts we owed to abiomed and terminated previously existing agreements  arrangements and understandings with us 
the purchase price delivered by venrock and ssf at the closing was offset by repayment of the principal and interest owed on the bridge loan facility the bridge loan of  that venrock and ssf had previously provided to us 
as part of the recapitalization transaction  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  common shares to our advisors  pacific growth equities  llc and stifel  nicolaus and company see notes and 
on august   we announced that we were embarking on a phased consolidation into a primary facility at our current location in salt lake city  utah 
our focus is on the development  clinical trial and subsequent commercialization of the advanced rotary levacor vad as the first generation novacor lvas reaches the natural end of its product life cycle 
on august   we completed the first phase of our consolidation plan and eliminated five positions at our oakland facility  including the position of vice president of manufacturing 
on february   as part of our consolidation plan  we announced that we had appointed salt lake city based mr 
john alexander martin as our president and chief executive officer 
mr 
jal s 
jassawalla  our former president and ceo  will continue to be based in oakland  along with certain key employees in areas such as research and development  clinical affairs and regulatory affairs and will continue to serve the corporation as executive vice president and chief technology officer 
included in the consolidation plan is the appointment of a chief financial officer to be based in salt lake city  the elimination of some positions in oakland and the relocation of certain positions to salt lake city by approximately the fourth quarter of research and development by our competitors is proceeding on several rotary flow devices 
certain of these devices have received the ce mark in europe and are advancing through clinical trials in the united states and europe  and one device has just received us marketing approval 
we believe that our levacor vad is the most advanced fourth generation rotary device under development 
although the patient population for destination therapy  the implanting of a vad to provide support for a patient not currently eligible for a heart transplant  continues to be largely untreated by cardiac assist devices  and the adoption rates have been slower than anticipated  we believe that the destination therapy market will evolve more rapidly when newer devices are evaluated clinically and as experience with next generation vads increases

historically  sales of novacor lvas implant kits and related peripheral equipment and services accounted for the majority of our revenue 
in the current year  we generated a significant amount of revenue from sales of spus segmented poly urethane solution  a solution used in the novacor lvas 
the solution was sold to a medical device manufacturer for use in their products 
the corporation does not expect significant sales of spus to occur in the future 
we primarily sell our products directly  except for a few countries where we sell through distributors

this was offset by  of early payment discounts granted our customers 
for  investment income from interest earned on invested cash was  and other income was  which consisted primarily of  in deferred revenue taken into income and  from a reduction of a reserve 
although average daily balances of invested cash were greater in  earnings were lower due to the significant decline in interest rates in we anticipate our investment income may decrease in resulting from a decrease in average daily cash balances as cash is used for operations  combined with declining interest rates in this weak and uncertain global economy

the fair value of these liabilities is based on a net present value model using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
these liabilities will be paid out over the remainder of the leased properties terms in december investment risk worldheart is subject to investment risk on investments that it makes with excess cash 
investment risk is mitigated by close adherence to an established investment policy  which has been approved by the board of directors 
the policy sets liquidity criteria  and counter party risk diversification criteria and restricts investments to investment grade quality instruments of aa or better or r medium or better in the case of commercial paper 
income exposure resulting from a decline in interest rates is not significant due to the short term maturity of investments  all of which were in money market funds during we have assets and liabilities in foreign currencies  including primarily the euro and canadian dollar 
worldheart s current foreign currency exposure is immaterial 
however  it may  in the future  enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to mitigate its foreign exchange risks 
we did not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or hedging transactions in 
table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies our management makes certain assumptions and estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  and revenues and expenses
