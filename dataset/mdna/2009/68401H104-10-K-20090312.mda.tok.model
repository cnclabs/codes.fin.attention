item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and other parts of this report may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing innovative anti infective products 
our current development efforts are focused on products that treat gastrointestinal infections  and related diseases where current therapies have limitations  including limited efficacy  serious adverse side effects  drug to drug interactions  difficult patient compliance and bacterial resistance 
we currently have two late stage anti infective product candidates  fidaxomicin  formerly known as opt  and prulifloxacin 
fidaxomicin  our lead product candidate  is an antibiotic currently in its second phase registration trial for the treatment of cdi  the most common nosocomial  or hospital acquired  diarrhea 
in november  we reported positive data from the first fidaxomicin phase trial  the largest single comparative study ever conducted against vancocin 
the top line analysis of data from this trial showed that fidaxomicin achieved the primary endpoint of clinical cure and demonstrated a significantly lower recurrence rate compared to vancocin  the only fda approved antibiotic for the treatment of cdi 
fidaxomicin was also well tolerated in the trial 
the second fidaxomicin phase trial is on going and we anticipate completing enrollment and reporting data from this trial in we currently hold worldwide rights to fidaxomicin 
prulifloxacin is a prodrug in the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics  a widely used class of broad spectrum antibiotics 
we are developing prulifloxacin as a treatment for infectious diarrhea in travelers 
in july  we reported positive top line data from the first phase trial conducted in mexico and peru and in february  we reported positive top line data from the second phase trial conducted in india  guatemala and mexico 
the top line analysis of data from these studies showed that prulifloxacin met the primary endpoint of tlus compared to placebo 
we intend to conduct a phase trial of prulifloxacin subsequent to the nda submission to compare prulifloxacin to ciprofloxacin for the treatment of infectious diarrhea 
we plan to initially seek approval for prulifloxacin for the treatment of infectious diarrhea in travelers 
we are developing additional product candidates using our proprietary technology  including our optimer one pot synthesis  or opops drug discovery platform 
opops is a computer aided technology that enables the rapid and low cost synthesis of a wide array of carbohydrate based compounds 
two components of the opops technology that allow us to synthesize new compounds are glycooptimization and de novo glycosylation 
these technologies are capable of rapidly generating drug candidates for broad therapeutic application 
one of the more advanced opops product candidates is opt  a disease modifying intra articular  or within the cavity of a joint  therapy for osteoarthritis 
we plan to submit an investigational new drug application in and subsequently to  either ourselves or with a partner  initiate a phase study to assess safety of repetitive intra articular injections of opt in patients with knee osteoarthritis 
we also acquired exclusive rights from memorial sloan kettering cancer center to develop and commercialize opt  a novel carbohydrate based cancer immunotherapy 
we plan to seek a partner and initiate phase clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in asia in we were incorporated in november since inception  we have focused on developing our product candidates  including fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin 
we have never been profitable and have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  including the costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current lead product candidates  license fees and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we pursue the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates  as well as acquire or in license additional products or product candidates  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 

table of contents financial operations overview collaboration and grant revenues we have not generated any revenues from sales of commercial products 
since inception  we have generated revenues primarily as a result of various collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and grants from government agencies 
we may also periodically recognize as revenues non refundable payments for achieving certain milestones during the term of our collaboration agreements 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with identifying and developing our drug candidates and developing and advancing our drug discovery technology 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials managed by our cros and costs associated with non clinical research activities and regulatory approvals 
our most significant costs are for clinical trials  including payments to vendors such as cros  investigators  manufacturers of clinical supplies and related consultants 
our historical research and development expenses have resulted predominantly from our clinical trials of fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin  the development of our carbohydrate technology platforms  including opops  in licensing fees and general research activities 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred because the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future uses 
from inception through december   we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately million 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects  and much of this use is not allocable to a specific project 
accordingly  we do not account for all of our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
in addition to our internal resources  we use external service providers and vendors to conduct our clinical trials  to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other research and development related products and services 
these external costs are allocable to specific projects 
external costs are expensed as incurred 
we incurred million  million and million of research and development expenses directly related to the development of fidaxomicin for the years ended december  and  and cumulatively through december   respectively 
the decrease in these research and development expenses  from to  resulted primarily from expense recorded in related to a million payment to par pharmaceutical to regain the rights to fidaxomicin in north america 
we incurred million  million  and million of research and development expenses directly related to the development of prulifloxacin for the years ended december  and  and cumulatively through december   respectively 
all other research and development expenses were for other clinical programs 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we complete our clinical trial activities with respect to fidaxomicin  prepare regulatory filings for marketing approval of fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin  incur expenses related to large scale manufacturing of fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin  advance our other product candidates through the development process and invest in additional product opportunities and research programs 
although we expect our costs associated with clinical trials to decrease as we complete the second of two phase clinical trials for fidaxomicin  we expect to incur substantial costs in the preparation of applications for regulatory approval and manufacturing and scale up for fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin 
the process of conducting pre clinical and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates is time consuming  expensive and subject to many uncertainties 
for example  the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients enrolled  the rate of enrollment and the duration of patient treatment and follow up 
in addition  it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly lengthen the regulatory approval process and increase expenses 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
however  while we do not have specific estimates for the costs of all of our projects  we currently estimate that we will incur external costs of approximately million to complete the phase clinical trials for fidaxomicin to treat cdi and approximately million to complete the phase clinical trials for prulifloxacin to treat infectious diarrhea in travelers 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation  and other expenses related to an allocated portion of facility cost  legal fees and other professional services expenses  our corporate 
table of contents administrative employees and insurance costs 
we anticipate that we will maintain our existing level of general and administrative expenditures 
however  we will make determinations as to the necessary levels of general and administrative expenditures on an on going basis in response to our research and development activities and regulatory obligations 
interest income expense and other  net interest income expense and other  net consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and other than temporary declines in the market value of available for sale securities and cash and non cash interest charges related to bridge financings 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december  we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in for federal purposes and for state purposes 
the foreign losses originate from our subsidiary in taiwan 
the losses from our subsidiary in taiwan expire five years after origination 
as of december   we had both federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credits will begin expiring in unless previously utilized and the state tax credits carryforward indefinitely 
as of december   we had a state manufacturer s investment tax credit carryforward of approximately  which will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits before they expire 
as of december   we have completed a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating losses and credit carryovers and had determined that the maximum amount of us federal and state nol and credit carryovers are available for utilization  subject to the annual limitation 
based on the analysis  the related deferred tax assets were reinstated in and the corresponding valuation allowance was increased 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of future limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in the unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our collaboration agreements contain multiple elements  including non refundable upfront fees  payments for reimbursement of third party research costs  payments for ongoing research  payments associated with achieving specific development milestones and royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales  if any 
we apply the revenue recognition criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf in applying these revenue recognition criteria  we consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the elements are separable  whether there are determinable fair values and whether there is a unique earnings process associated with each element of a contract 
cash received in advance of services being performed is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed over the applicable term of the agreement 
when a payment is specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenues are recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant and substantive milestones 
revenues from milestone payments may be considered separable from funding for research services because of the uncertainty surrounding the achievement of milestones for products in early stages of development 
accordingly  these milestone 
table of contents payments are allowed to be recognized as revenue if and when the performance milestone is achieved if they represent a substantive earnings process as described in eitf in connection with certain research collaboration agreements  revenues are recognized from non refundable upfront fees  which we do not believe are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the agreement or the period over which we have significant involvement or perform services 
research fees are recognized as revenue as the related research activities are performed 
revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants are recorded in compliance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
according to the criteria established by these eitf issues  in transactions where we act as a principal  with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services required in the transaction  we record revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
none of the payments that we have received from collaborators to date  whether recognized as revenue or deferred  are refundable even if the related program is not successful 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials  compensation  including stock based compensation  and other expenses related to research and development  including personnel costs  facilities costs and depreciation 
when nonrefundable payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are made  we apply the criteria outlined in eitf issue  or eitf  accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
in accordance with eitf  these types of payments are deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts are expensed when the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
accrued clinical trial costs a substantial portion of our on going research and development activities are performed under agreements we enter into with external service providers  including cros  who conduct many of our research and development activities 
we accrue the costs incurred under these contracts based on factors such as estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and costs historically incurred for similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  we adjust our accruals 
historically  our accruals have been within management s estimates  and no material adjustments to research and development expenses have been recognized 
subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
we used the modified prospective method when we adopted sfas no 
r and accordingly we did not restate the results of operations for the prior periods 
compensation expense of million  million and million was recognized in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our stock awards based on the quoted market price of our common stock 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
the expected volatility rates are based on the historical fluctuation in the stock price since inception 
the average expected term is calculated using sab no 
 simplified method for estimating the expected term 

table of contents expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
the risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis or sooner if there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and collaboration and grant revenues 
collaboration and grant revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase in revenue from a nih research grant  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a collaboration with a natural healthcare company which was completed in research and development expense 
research and development for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  was due primarily to a million payment in to par to regain the rights to fidaxomicin in north america  and the purchase of million of clinical supply material and active pharmaceutical ingredient 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in expenses of million related to our fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin phase clinical trials in marketing expense 
marketing expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase in medical education and pre launch marketing efforts related to fidaxomicin 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively

interest income and other  net 
net interest income and other for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  was primarily due to lower cash and short term investments and lower overall interest rates 
in addition  we recorded an impairment on our long term investments of  in comparison of years ended december  and collaboration and grant revenues 
collaboration and grant revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from a nih grant and the conclusion of a development and license agreement  partially offset by an increase of  related to a collaboration with a natural healthcare company 
research and development expense 
research and development for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the increase of  or was due primarily to the million payment to par to reacquire the rights to fidaxomicin in north america and israel  the advancement of our fidaxomicin and prulifloxacin clinical trials  including the initiation of the second pivotal phase trial for fidaxomicin  and the purchase of million of fidaxomicin clinical supply material and active pharmaceutical ingredient for the fidaxomicin clinical study 
marketing 
we incurred  of marketing expense in the year ended december  and no such expense in the year ended december  the expenses in the year ended december  were related to salaries and pre launch activities which include medical education  scientific conferences  and public relations services 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  was due to increased expenses to support a public 
table of contents company infrastructure which included higher legal expenses  insurance and compensation expenses  including a  of stock compensation expense  an increase of  over the prior year 
interest income and other  net 
net interest income and other for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to higher cash and short term investment balances as a result of our initial public offering completed in february and our private placement offering which closed in october liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through march   we received gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows in may  we sold a total of million shares of series a preferred stock for proceeds of million  from march to december  we sold a total of million shares of series b preferred stock for proceeds of million  in april  we sold a total of million shares of series c preferred stock for proceeds of million  from april to november  we sold a total of million shares of series d preferred stock for proceeds of million  in february  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering for proceeds of million  in october  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement offering for proceeds million  in july  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering for proceeds of million  and in march  we sold a total of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering for proceeds of million 
until required for operations  we invest a substantial portion of our available funds in money market funds  corporate debt securities  united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments  all of which are investment grade quality 
we have established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
cash flows as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately million as compared to million as of december  the decrease of approximately million was primarily due to cash used in operations and was partially offset by million raised in a registered direct offering in july in addition  as noted above  in march  we raised million in a registered direct offering 
we cannot be certain if  when or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase over the next few years as we advance the development of our product candidates and prepare for regulatory submissions and commercialization 
in february  we regained worldwide rights to fidaxomicin from par under a prospective buy back agreement 
we paid par a one time million termination fee and purchased million of fidaxomicin clinical supply material and active pharmaceutical ingredient 
we are obligated to pay par a one time million milestone payment  a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in north america and israel  and a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in the rest of the world 
in addition  in the event we license our right to market fidaxomicin in the rest of the world  we will be required to pay par a royalty on net revenues we receive related to fidaxomicin 
we are obligated to pay each of these royalties  if any  on 
table of contents a country by country basis for seven years commencing on the applicable commercial launch in each such country 
in connection with the exercise of our rights under the prospective buy back agreement  par assigned to us a supply agreement with biocon 
under this agreement  biocon is obligated to supply to us our requirements of the fidaxomicin api for certain markets 
we may be obligated to pay a million prepayment to biocon  subject to future set offs 
in june  we entered into a license agreement with nippon shinyaku pursuant to which we acquired the non exclusive right to import and purchase prulifloxacin  and the exclusive right with the right to sublicense  within the united states  to develop  make  use  offer to sell  sell and license products suitable for consumption by humans containing prulifloxacin 
additionally  we acquired rights within the united states to a key patent which covers the compound and the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be required to pay nippon shinyaku a milestone payment in the amount of million upon the filing  if any  of an nda for prulifloxacin in the united states 
in october  our compensation committee adopted a severance benefit plan covering certain eligible employees of the company  including executive officers 
pursuant to the plan  upon an involuntary termination other than for cause an eligible employee may be entitled to receive specified severance benefits 
the benefits may include cash severance payments and acceleration of stock award vesting 
the level of benefits provided under the plan depends upon an eligible employee s position and years of service  and whether the termination is related to a change in control 
funding requirements our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the following the progress of our clinical trials  including expenses to support the trials and the milestone payments that may become payable to par and nippon shinyaku  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including partnerships and other arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting  enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing sales or distribution capabilities  the commercial success of our products  and the extent to which we in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from offerings of our equity securities and collaborations and government grants 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of additional equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in entering into additional collaboration agreements  in receiving milestone or royalty payments under new or existing collaboration agreements  in obtaining new government grants or in obtaining equity or debt financing 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  that financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all of our rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise funds by incurring additional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table describes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations we contracted with a cro for clinical research services for the fidaxomicin phase clinical trials and prulifloxacin phase clinical trials 
we have issued purchase orders totaling million as of december  for these services  million  million and million were issued in   and  respectively 
as of december   we have paid million related to these purchase orders 
we can terminate the service agreement at any time upon days written notice to the cro 
we have not included any amounts related to the cro contract in the table above 
the contractual obligations table does not include a a potential future milestone payment in the amount of million to nippon shinyaku due upon filing our first nda in the united states for prulifloxacin  b potential future milestone payments to cempra in the amount of million due upon the regulatory approval of each of the first two products we develop under our licensing agreement with cempra in any country which is a member of the association of southeast asian nations  or asean  c potential future milestone payments to ski for each product licensed under the ski agreement as follows i  upon the commencement of phase clinical studies  ii  upon the filing of the first nda  iii million upon marketing approval in the united states and iv million upon marketing approval in each and any of japan and certain european countries  d potential future milestone payments of up to million to tsri due upon achievement of certain clinical milestones  the filing of ndas or their foreign equivalents and government marketing and distribution approval  or e a future million milestone payment to par upon the earliest occurrence of i the successful completion by us of our pivotal phase trial for fidaxomicin  ii our grant to a third party of the rights to fidaxomicin or iii the submission to the fda of an nda for fidaxomicin 
we may also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of prulifloxacin  fidaxomicin and other licensed product candidates 
the milestone and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest  sometimes called minority interest  as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this new standard requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments  including those

it is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
in january  the fasb fsp issued fsp eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf this new standard amends the impairment guidance in eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  to achieve more consistent determination  of whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
fsp eitf also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other than temporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements in fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and other related guidance 
fsp eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december   and shall be applied prospectively 
retrospective application to a prior interim or annual reporting period is prohibited 
we adopted this standard in our fiscal year ended december  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds  corporate debt securities  united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in approximately a  change in net loss 
accordingly  we do not expect that our operating results or cash flows would be affected to any significant degree a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate
