critical accounting estimates preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
the company s application of these policies involves assumptions that require difficult subjective judgments regarding many factors  which  in and of themselves  could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures 
a future change in the estimates  assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters  among others  could have a material impact on future financial statements and disclosures 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method in for approximately of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method for approximately of inventories 
the major rubber material inventory and related work in process and their finished goods are accounted for under the fifo method 
the major steel material inventory and related work in process and their finished goods are accounted for under the lifo method 
market value is estimated based on current selling prices 
estimated provisions are established for excess and obsolete inventory  as well as inventory carried above market price based on historical experience 
should experience change  adjustments to the estimated provisions would be necessary 
income taxes deferred income tax provisions are determined using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax asset positions and recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc income taxes

impairment of goodwill the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each annual reporting period  and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates and using an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda multiple approach 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends and economic conditions 
when the company s estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step of the impairment analysis is performed 
in this second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a noncash charge for the impairment of goodwill of million on both a pre tax and after tax basis 
the charge was associated with the reporting units of the company s agricultural million  earthmoving construction million  and consumer million segments

significant assumptions relating to future operations must be made when estimating future cash flows in analyzing goodwill for impairment 
assumptions utilized in analyzing goodwill are highly judgmental  especially given the worldwide recession and global economic crisis 
retirement benefit obligations pension benefit obligations are based on various assumptions used by third party actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
revisions in assumptions and actual results that differ from the assumptions affect future expenses  cash funding requirements and obligations
