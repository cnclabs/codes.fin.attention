outlook our business remains highly correlated to the general economy and competitive pricing pressures  as well as the success of company specific improvement initiatives 
there remains considerable uncertainty as to the direction of the economy going into including the timing of any economic recovery 
we are evaluating further initiatives to reduce costs in line with declining volumes and yields 
additionally  we are closely monitoring financing alternatives for capital and other needs  if required 
we plan to continue to focus on providing top quality service and improving safety performance 
if financially troubled competitors were to cease operations and their capacity leave the market  current industry excess capacity could improve 
however  there can be no assurance that any industry consolidation will indeed happen or if such consolidation occurs that it will materially improve the excess industry capacity 
the company plans to continue to pursue revenue and cost initiatives to improve profitability 
planned revenue initiatives include  but are not limited to  building density and improving performance in our current geography  targeted marketing initiatives to grow revenue in more profitable segments  as well as pricing and yield management 
the extent of success of these revenue initiatives is impacted by what proves to be the underlying economic trends  competitor initiatives and other factors discussed under risk factors 
planned cost management initiatives include  but are not limited to  seeking gains in productivity and asset utilization that collectively are designed to offset anticipated inflationary unit cost increases in healthcare  workers compensation and all the other expense categories 
specific cost initiatives include linehaul routing optimization  reduction in costs of purchased transportation  expansion of wireless dock technology and an enhanced weight and inspection process 
the company s vacation expense will return to historical levels in the following cost reductions taken in are subject to reinstatement in the future including the suspension of the company s k match  reduction in compensation equal to percent of salary for the company s leadership team and a five percent wage reduction for hourly  linehaul and salaried employees in operations  maintenance and administration  
table of contents and the percent reduction in the annual retainer and meeting fees paid to the non employee members of the company s board of directors 
if the company builds market share  there are numerous operating leverage cost benefits 
conversely  should the economy soften from present levels  the company plans to attempt to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage 
the success of cost improvement initiatives is also impacted by the cost and availability of drivers and purchased transportation  fuel  insurance claims  regulatory changes  successful implementation of profit improvement initiatives and other factors discussed under risk factors and forward looking statements

critical accounting policies and estimates the company makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of the company include claims and insurance accruals 
the company has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to million per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
for the policy year march through february only  the company has an aggregate exposure limited to an additional million above its million per claim deductible under its auto liability program 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by the company are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis with respect to workers compensation claims  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of the company differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pickup and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the company s accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for the company s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
equity based incentive compensation 
the company maintains long term incentive compensation arrangements in the form of stock options  restricted stock and stock based awards 
the criteria for the stock based awards are total shareholder return versus a peer group of companies over a three year performance period 
as required by the compensation stock compensation topic of fasb asc  the company accounts for its stock based awards with the expense amortized over the three year vesting period based on the monte carlo fair value method at the date the stock based awards are granted

these accounting policies  and others  are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of interest rates and fuel prices 
the detail of the company s debt structure is more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
to help mitigate our risk to rising fuel prices  the company has implemented a fuel surcharge program 
this program is well established within the industry and customer acceptance of fuel surcharges remains high 
since the amount of fuel surcharge is based on average national diesel fuel prices and is reset weekly  exposure of the company to fuel price volatility is significantly reduced 
however  the fuel surcharge may not fully offset fuel price fluctuations during periods of rapid increases or decreases in the price of fuel and is also subject to overall competitive pricing negotiations
