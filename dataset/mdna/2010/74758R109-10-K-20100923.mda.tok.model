part i item business introduction we design  develop  manufacture and sell automated magnetic tape libraries used to store  retrieve and manage electronic data primarily in network computing environments 
tape libraries consist of cartridge tape drives  tape cartridges and robotics to move the cartridges from their storage locations to the tape drives under software control 
our tape libraries provide data storage solutions for organizations requiring backup  recovery and archival storage of critical data 
our products are compatible with commonly used operating systems  including unix  windows  and linux 
our tape libraries are also compatible with a wide range of storage management software packages  such as those supplied by ca technologies  emc  ibm  symantec  commvault and bakbone software 
we sell our tape libraries worldwide  primarily to value added resellers 
these customers typically integrate our tape libraries with software from third party vendors and related hardware such as servers and network components to provide complete storage solutions  which are then sold to end users 
we configure our libraries based on each customer s individual requirements  with a normal delivery time of one to five working days 
this rapid fulfillment of customer orders allows our resellers to minimize their inventory levels and allows us to compete effectively with distribution channels used by our competitors 
we also design  develop  manufacture and sell high efficiency open frame switching power supplies 
our power supplies are used to convert common alternating current ac line voltages found in buildings to direct current dc voltages that are needed internally to operate most electronic equipment 
we also manufacture and sell a series of dc to dc power supplies that convert one dc voltage to another dc voltage 
we entered the power supply business in  when we purchased the assets of npower  incorporated 
power supplies provided by our npower division are utilized within some of our tape library products as well as sold to original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers for incorporation into their products 
npower products are sold under the npower brand name as well as under a private label brand name through independent sales representatives and distributors 
tape libraries and power supplies comprise qualstar s two operating segments 
revenues from our tape library segment represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal  approximately of revenues for fiscal  and approximately of revenues for fiscal revenues from our power supply segment represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal  approximately of revenues for fiscal  and approximately of revenues for fiscal qualstar was incorporated in california in data storage industry background storing  managing and protecting data has become critical to the operation of many enterprises and governments as the world economy becomes increasingly information dependent 
the data storage industry is reacting in response to the increase in the amount of data that is generated and that must be preserved 
the amount of data has been increasing due to the growth in the number of computers  the number  size and complexity of computer networks and software applications  and the emergence of new applications 
in addition  businesses continue to generate increasing amounts of traditional business information with respect to their products  customers and financial data 
this increase in the amount of data that is generated stimulates increases in the demand for data storage and the management of this data 
factors driving growth in data storage increased demand from internet businesses 
the growth in the internet has created businesses that depend on the creation  access to and archival storage of data 
we believe this demand will continue to grow as individuals and businesses increase their reliance on the internet for communications and commerce 
growth in new types of data 
new types of data are also fueling the growth in data storage 
for example  graphics  audio  video and medical images  and multi media uses such as video archiving  require far greater storage capacity than text and numerical financial data 
recognition of the critical importance of data 
corporate databases contain useful information about customer records  order patterns and other factors that can be analyzed and transformed into a valuable asset and a competitive advantage 
the ability to efficiently store  manage and protect this information is important to the value and success of many businesses 
the usefulness of past and present data is further enhanced by sophisticated data mining software applications that can access and analyze large databases 
need for disaster protection 
companies recognize that loss of data may threaten their survival 
natural disasters  as well as overt and covert actions targeted at individual companies or classes of users  can destroy data  threatening a company s very existence 
systematic replication and secure off site storage of corporate data is recognized as an important defense against catastrophic data loss 
tape libraries are a key technology in most corporate data disaster protection plans 
compliance with regulatory requirements for records retention 
many businesses must deal with regulatory requirements from various governmental agencies that require businesses to retain data for long periods of time 
the regulations that have received the most visibility in the united states include hipaa requirements covering medical records  and rule a under the securities exchange act of  regarding recordkeeping requirements for the securities industry 
these regulations and others are projected to sustain the demand for long term storage 
this pressure to retain records is not unique to the united states  but is global in nature 
growth in network computing applications and data 
the use of computer networks has shifted critical information and applications to network servers to allow more people to gain access to stored data 
as the speed of network computing has increased  numerous new applications have become feasible that generate progressively more data 
organizations are increasingly aware of the need to protect this data  as networks become a mission critical element of many operations 
decrease in the costs of storing data 
the costs of data storage have decreased with advances in technology and improved manufacturing processes 
we expect these costs to continue to decrease 
the decrease in the cost of data storage encourages the storage of more data and makes it more cost effective to simply add more storage capacity than to remove old data  which in the past may have been purged periodically due to cost constraints 
electrical efficiency of tape based data storage 
data stored on tape requires considerably less electrical energy as compared to data stored on rotating disks 
as energy costs increase  we believe that electrical efficiency will become a more important factor in the selection of storage methods 
advances in data storage management technologies the growth in data is contributing to an evolution in traditional storage solutions 
new technologies are designed to provide high speed connectivity for data intensive applications across multiple operating systems 
these new methods of storage and data management technologies include the following fibre channel 
fibre channel is an interface technology based on industry standards for the connection of storage devices to networks 
interface is the term used to describe the electronics  cabling and software used to facilitate communications between devices 
with fibre channel  users are better able to share stored information with other storage devices and servers over longer distances  with faster data transfer speeds 
storage area networks 
storage area network  or san  architecture applies the inherent benefits of a networked approach to data storage applications  which allows data to move efficiently and reliably between multiple storage devices and servers 
the benefits of san architecture also include increasing the expandability of existing storage solutions and providing a higher level of connectivity than exists with traditional technologies 
additionally  sans are able to provide these benefits across multiple operating systems 
advanced storage management software 
this software automatically migrates infrequently accessed data to the lower cost storage medium such as a tape library 
a user s request for this data at some later date will recall the data automatically from the tape library 
this process reduces the overall storage cost by using the least expensive storage medium to store data that may be needed on an infrequent basis 
advances in storage management software have increased the ability of businesses to more cost effectively store  manage and retrieve data  which in turn allows businesses to operate more efficiently 
network attached storage 
current storage devices are dependent on a file server for all commands and control 
network attached storage devices give storage devices file server functionality  which allow users to plug a storage device directly into a network without requiring a separate file server 
this allows users to maintain  or even enhance  system performance while saving on both time and cost 
types of data storage current non volatile storage solutions are based primarily on two technologies magnetic disk and magnetic tape 
these technologies represent a compromise among a variety of competing factors including capacity  cost  speed  portability and data reliability 
magnetic tapes are removable  which allows them to be transported easily to an off site location for security or protection from physical harm 
magnetic disks provide faster access to stored data and generally are used when speed is important 
less frequently used data is often migrated from magnetic disks to tape storage 
tape libraries provide an online solution  where less frequently used data files are stored on tape at substantially lower cost compared to disk while still providing automated access 
tape libraries and applications tape libraries automate the tape loading process  eliminate errors induced by human operators  and enhance security compared to tapes that must be retrieved and loaded manually 
tape libraries can also be operated from remote locations around the clock  thus  eliminating the need for an operator 
automated tape libraries are a key component in a company s overall storage solution and data protection strategy when large amounts of data are involved 
tape drives and tape media are the two key components of tape libraries 
the cost per unit of data capacity of tape drives and tape media continue to decline with advances in technology 
as prices decline  new applications for automated storage become justified  further increasing the number of applications that can benefit from the use of tape libraries 
we believe that continued technological improvements in tape drives and tape media will continue to reduce overall storage costs in the future 
current and emerging applications for tape libraries include automated backup 
backup is the creation of a duplicate copy of current data for the purpose of recovering the data in the event the original is lost or damaged 
an automated tape library  in conjunction with storage management software  can backup network data at any time without human intervention 
a library with multiple tape drives can backup data using all of its drives simultaneously  thus significantly speeding up the recording process 
backup tapes can be removed from the library and stored in an off site location for protection against a loss of the primary site 
archiving 
archiving is the storage of data for historical purposes 
when information is stored on tape  automated tape libraries  under application control  can catalog tapes for future retrieval and prevent unauthorized removal or corruption of data by using password or key lock protection 
archival tapes provide a historic record for use in fraud detection  audit  legal and other processes 
tape libraries are also used for archiving due to benefits offered by the tape medium  such as long term data integrity  resistance to environmental contamination  ease of relocation and low cost 
data encryption 
recent generations of tape drives have incorporated built in data encryption features that make the date unrecoverable without a bit key number being provided to the tape drive along with the request 
three basic methods of encryption key management exist the backup recovery software can mange the keys and direct the drive to encrypt decrypt via the normal command data scsi interface  the tape library can invoke encryption  manage  and supply the key to the drive via the drive s serial interface  or an external key manager can supply keys to the tape drive driver in various host operating systems  which directs the drive to perform encryption and decryption via the scsi interface 
the end result is a flexible system providing considerable improved data security for tapes in transit or stored in an off site location 
image management 
storage intensive applications such as satellite mapping and medical image management systems utilize tape libraries because of the cost advantage over traditional storage methods 
x ray images or mri results  for instance  must frequently be kept on file for years 
storing a digitized image in a tape library costs considerably less than storing a film copy  and can be retrieved years later with the click of a mouse 
distribution of tape library products the requirements for storage solutions vary depending on the size of an enterprise  the type of data generated and the amount of data to be stored 
with the increased dependence on stored data  most organizations  regardless of their size  have a heightened need for storage solutions that integrate devices such as tape drives  tape libraries and storage management software 
those organizations with sufficient in house information technology resources can rely on their internal infrastructure and expertise to design purchase and implement their own storage solutions 
these organizations may elect to purchase equipment from distributors or directly from the original equipment manufacturers 
many organizations  however  do not have sufficient in house resources but have the same need for data storage solutions 
these o rganizations often look to value added resellers to design  supply and install their storage solutions 
value added resellers develop and install storage solutions for enterprises that face complex storage needs but lack the in house capability of designing and implementing the proper solution or have chosen to outsource these functions 
typically  the value added reseller will select among a variety of different hardware technologies and software options  as well as provide installation and other services  to deliver a complete storage solution for the end user 
value added resellers require rapid turnaround of orders  custom configuration of tape libraries  drop shipment to their customer s site and marketing and technical support 
our tape library solutions we offer storage solutions that respond to the growing data management challenges facing businesses today  while addressing the unique needs of value added resellers 
we believe that high reliability is important to the end users of our products due to the critical nature of the data that is being stored  shorter time periods available for the back up operations  and the operation of backup systems during hours when personnel may not be available to respond to problems 
to address these concerns  we emphasize quality and reliability in the design  manufacturing and testing of our product  which reduces the potential for product failures and results in products that require little maintenance 
the technology utilized in automated tape libraries is continuously evolving due to advances in data recording methods  component cost reductions  advances in semiconductor and microprocessor technologies  and a general trend toward miniaturization in the electronics industry 
this changing technology requires that we continuously develop and market new products to prevent our product lines from becoming obsolete 
our tape libraries are compatible with over third party storage management software packages  including those supplied by ca technologies  emc  ibm  symantec  commvault and bakbone software 
storage management software enables network administrators to allocate the use of storage resources among user groups or tasks  to manage data from a central location  and to retrieve  transfer and backup data between multiple workstations 
we believe that storage management software is a crucial component of any automated storage installation  and lack of compatibility is a significant barrier to entry for new tape library competitors 
to ensure compatibility  our engineers work with independent software vendors during the product development cycles 
we do not have contracts with any independent software vendors  nor do we n eed access to their software code to design our products 
we maintain relationships with them by making tape libraries available so they can qualify their software to work with our tape libraries and by evaluating their software for compatibility with our tape libraries 
we also support our relationships with them by keeping them informed about current and anticipated changes to our products 
strategy tape libraries our goal is to enhance our position as a supplier of automated tape libraries and to increase our market share in each of the product categories in which we compete 
to achieve this goal  we intend to focus our development efforts on higher margin product categories 
in fiscal we began shipments of a newly developed library system referred to as the xls family of products 
the xls expands the breadth of our product line into the enterprise computing environment where tape capacities may range into the tens of thousands of tapes 
we intend to continue to build on this product category with future product releases and enhancements in order to pursue this market segment where the potential margins are higher than we have traditionally enjoyed 
focus on value added reseller channels 
we sell our products through selected value added resellers who have a strong market presence  have demonstrated the ability to work directly with end users  and who maintain relationships with major vendors of storage management software 
because we market our products through this channel  we have implemented a variety of programs to support and enhance our relationships with our reseller partners 
these programs are designed to benefit the reseller and increase the likelihood of selling our products 
we intend to maintain our marketing presence in support of this channel 
we conduct business with our value added resellers on an individual purchase order basis and no long term purchase commitments are involved 
we believe that our experience  efficiency and control over the development and manufacture of new products are key factors in the successful execution of our strategy 
we design our tape libraries with a high percentage of common parts  use quality components and minimize the number of moving parts 
we utilize proprietary techniques in the design  production and testing of our libraries in order to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce our costs 
we manufacture all of our tape automation products at a single facility and we control our inventory closely to provide rapid delivery to our customers 
these steps allow us to design and efficiently bring to market new products in response to changing technology 
power supplies our strategy for the power supply business is to selectively pursue market opportunities where we can command a premium price for high efficiency products rather than becoming a commodity supplier 
as electronic devices continue to shrink in size  many designers are forced to consider our high density  high efficiency approach 
our power supply products are made to our specifications by contract manufacturers in china 
products tape libraries we offer a number of tape library families  each capable of incorporating one or more tape drive technologies  as summarized in the following table product family tape drive technology range of tape cartridges maximum capacity in terabytes tls lto to rls lto to xls series lto to  a terabyte is one million megabytes  or one thousand gigabytes 
the table shows native capacity and excludes gains from data compression  which can increase capacity by more than 
our tape library families include a number of models that differ in storage capacity  price and features 
our libraries are installed in network computing environments ranging from small departmental networks to enterprise wide networks supporting hundreds of users 
tape libraries generally contain two or more tape drives and from eleven to thousands of tapes 
we design our tape libraries for continuous  unattended operation 
multiple tape drives allow simultaneous access to different data files by different users on the network and increase the rate at which data can move on to  out of  or within the network 
a library with multiple tape drives can back up data using multiple drives simultaneously  significantly speeding up the recording process 
in our libraries  some tape cartridges are stored in removable magazines  allowing for easy bulk removal of the tapes 
our libraries also offer features such as barcode readers to scan cartridge labels and input output ports for importing and exporting tapes under system control 
most of our library models are expandable in the field by increasing the number of tape storage positions 
this feature provides the end user with the ability to increase data capacity as storage requirements grow 
we continue to develop and release new libraries to expand our product offerings to meet the changing demands of the marketplace 
in addition  we continue to enhance and improve our existing products to maintain our competitive position 
some of our tape libraries incorporate a number of specialized features that we believe improve reliability  serviceability and performance  including rapid tape drive replacement 
we design our libraries so that a tape drive can be replaced quickly without special tools 
this feature minimizes the off line time required when a tape drive must be replaced  and frequently avoids the high cost and delays of a service call 
fibre channel connectivity 
we offer a fibre channel option on all of our models for connection to storage area networks and other high performance applications 
closed loop servo control 
our tape libraries use digital closed loop servo systems to control robotic motion and to provide precise tape handling 
this yields motion that is smooth  repeatable and highly reliable 
brushless motors 
motors are a key component in any robotic system 
we use only brushless electric motors in our tape libraries 
brushless motors provide longer life and less electrical noise compared to conventional brush type motors 
in some cases  we build our own motors in order to obtain optimum performance and reliability 
remote management 
many larger companies with global back up requirements or disaster management programs require tape libraries that can be located off site in various regions  but that must be administered from a single location 
with our remote library manager  customers can put libraries anywhere in the world and manage them from a single administrative hub using a standard web browser 
our rls series of tape libraries are designed to fit efficiently in equipment racks and provide back up capacity in as little as five standard rack height units  or a total of inches of rack space 
in addition  the rls and xls series are designed to support redundant power supplies and hot swappable tape drives 
our tls series of tape libraries are designed to be freestanding units for applications where an equipment rack may not be available or where the library is purchased after the original installation and rack space may not be available 
our xls series of tape libraries is designed to be expandable from to  tapes and is focused on the needs of large enterprises 
the xls product is feature rich and is intended to provide the customer with a highly reliable enterprise class solution 
we also sell ancillary products related to our tape libraries  such as tape media  tape magazines  cables  bar code labels and fiber channel adapters 
power supplies in addition to tape libraries  we design and sell high efficiency  open frame switching power supplies 
these power supplies are used to convert ac line voltage to dc as well as dc to dc for use in a wide variety of electronic equipment such as telecommunications equipment  servers  routers  switches  lighting and gaming devices 
our power supplies are sold under the npower brand 
we have specialized in units that are less than inches high and that are optimized for high efficiency operation 
the high efficiency allows the units to be operated in confined spaces without over heating 
these products are manufactured for us in china and sold to original equipment manufacturers oem and contract manufacturers as well as to distributors 
we believe that as worldwide energy concerns and energy costs rise  our high efficiency approach will become more important 
additionally  these power supplies are utilized within some of our tape library products 
we have developed a line of power supply products that deliver up to twice the power in half the space relative to competitors products 
manufacturers of servers  routers  switches  telecom gear  and other process based equipment continuously pursue smaller  more powerful  and more efficient power sources for their equipment to remain competitive 
additionally  new lighting devices are coming to market that are sealed because they are used outdoors 
sealed units require high efficiency power supplies to help reduce the detrimental effects of internal heat buildup 
each power supply undergoes a complete functional test and a multi hour burn in to insure that every unit meets our stringent quality requirements 
we believe our high efficiency design reduces loads on both power generating stations and air conditioning systems

our engineers provide both pre and post sales support to our representatives  distributors and customers 
engineers work with our customers over the telephone and at a customer site as required 
manufacturing and suppliers tape libraries we manufacture all of our tape libraries at our facility in simi valley  california 
we operate our manufacturing on a single shift 
however  if required  we have the ability to add additional shifts to increase our capacity 
to respond rapidly to orders  we build our tape libraries  perform full testing and then place the tape libraries in a holding area until an order is received 
once an order is confirmed  we remove the unit from the holding area  install tape drives and configure the unit to meet the specific requirements of the order  retest and then ship 
the manufacturing cycle to bring our libraries to a finished state is approximately five working days for our tls and rls libraries and approximately working days for our xls libraries 
we believe that this process represents an effective way to control our inventory levels while maintaining the ability to fill specific orders in short lead times 
we coordinate inventory planning and management with suppliers and customers to match our production to market demand 
once we confirm an order  we generally ship the product within one to five working days 
we believe this response time is among the fastest in the industry and gives us a competitive edge 
because we fill the majority of our orders as they are received  our backlog generally is small and is not indicative of future revenues 
we carefully select our suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts that meet our specifications 
inventory planning and management is coordinated closely with suppliers to match our production needs 
we maintain an inventory of components assembled into the libraries that are off the shelf and others that are designed to our specifications 
we use off the shelf parts to reduce the risk of parts shortages and keep a minimal inventory of these parts on hand 
tape drives and tape media are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
some of our suppliers compete with us by selling their own tape libraries 
any disruption in supplies of tape drives could delay shipments of our products 
power supplies our power supply products are made to our specifications by contract manufacturers in china 
these manufacturers have been carefully selected based on their manufacturing capacity  quality controls and process controls 
we also perform quality control testing on our products in our simi valley facility  where we maintain a small inventory of power supply products for rapid order fulfillment 
competition tape libraries the market for automated tape libraries is competitive and characterized by changing technology 
our principal competitors in this market segment include oracle corporation  quantum corporation  overland storage  inc  and spectralogic corporation 
key competitive factors include product features  reliability  durability  scalability and price 
barriers to entry in tape automation are relatively high 
the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate that our products will continue to face price pressure 
we believe our tape libraries compete favorably overall with respect to many of these factors 
power supplies our power supply products compete in a number of markets focused on the needs of oem and contract manufacturers 
we have concentrated on supplying units that provide superior electrical and high space efficiency as measured in watts of output per cubic inch 
our principal competitors in this market segment include power one  tdk lambda  digital power  astec artesyn divisions of emerson and xp power 
key competitive factors include product features  ultra small size  density  reliability  efficiency and total cost of ownership 
there are currently approximately manufacturers that our products compete directly with in regards to power range  size  efficiency and price 
although we will continue to face price pressure and barriers to entry in progressively higher tier markets  we believe our power supplies compare favorably against such competitors 
research and development our research and development expenses were approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal tape libraries our tape library research and development team consists of engineers and technicians who have data storage and related industry experience 
we have developed over separate tape library models for eleven different tape formats over the last years 
our tape library product development efforts rely on the integration of multiple engineering disciplines to generate products that meet market needs in a competitive and timely fashion 
successful development of automated tape libraries requires the integration of mechanical design  electronic design  packaging  and firmware design into a single product 
product success also relies on the engineering group s thorough knowledge of each of the different tape drive technologies 
our engineers work closely with the tape drive manufacturers during the drive qualification cycle to assure that reliable tape library and tape drive combinations are brought to market 
the design architecture of our tape libraries makes use of common parts across each product family  allowing us to develop and introduce new products quickly 
if a new tape drive is an advanced version of one already incorporated in one or more of our products  our time and dollar investment to incorporate the new drive can be relatively small  with the primary focus being on verification testing 
when the tape or tape drive form factors differ  the time and investment requirements can grow and may require development of a new product family altogether 
we also develop new products as we identify emerging market needs 
our sales  marketing  product development and engineering groups identify products to fulfill customer and marketplace needs 
our research and development group concentrates on leveraging previous engineering investments into new products 
for example  our firmware is based on successive generations of the operating system developed for our first library 
we also use common parts in our different library series and leverage our electro mechanical and electronic hardware technology from previous products into next generation designs 
power supplies our power supply development team continues to develop new power supply models and families in response to input from our customers 
all npower product development takes place at our corporate headquarters in simi valley  california 
the product development cycle involves circuit design  printed circuit board layouts  prototype testing  firmware development  safety agency and compliance testing and test equipment development 
environmental and compliance testing of our power supplies is conducted to assure our products meet environmental requirements of our market 
product testing is a substantial portion of our overall product development schedule and cost 
intellectual property we rely on copyright protection of our firmware  as well as patent protection for some of our designs and products 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we do not believe our intellectual property provides significant protection from competition 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the tape storage and power supply industries  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection are less significant than factors such as market responsiveness  knowledge  ability and experience of our personnel and timely new product introductions 
we enter into employee proprietary information and inventions agreements with all employees and consultants to protect our technology and designs 
however  we do not believe that such protection can preclude competitors from developing substantially equivalent products 
employees as of june   we had employees  including in operations and manufacturing  in research and development  in customer service and technical support  in sales and marketing  and in administration and finance 
we also employ a small number of temporary employees and consultants as needed 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other similar agreement 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees

risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  as described at page of this report under the caption forward looking statements 
we believe that the risks described below are the most important factors that may cause our actual future results of operations to differ materially from the results projected in the forward looking statements 
risks related to our business the principal risks applicable to our business in general are described below 
specific risks applicable to our tape library and power supply operating segments are described in the following subsections of item a 
we have a limited number of executives 
the loss of any single executive or the failure to hire and integrate capable new executives could harm our business 
the success of our business is tied closely to the managerial  engineering and business acumen of our existing executives 
william j 
gervais  our president  has been largely responsible for the development of most of our tape libraries  has overseen our operations  and established and maintained our strategic relationships 
we expect that he will continue these efforts for the foreseeable future 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate key executives and other key personnel  many of whom have been instrumental in developing new technologies and strategic plans 
we may not be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
however  our current dependence on a limited number of executives and other key personnel  for whom replac ements may be difficult to find  entails a risk that we may not be able to supervise and manage our ongoing operations 
our research and development spending may not yield results that justify the costs incurred 
in recent fiscal years we have spent substantial amounts for research and development 
our products and markets are technologically advanced and rapidly evolving  and we cannot be assured that these efforts will successfully provide us with new or upgraded products that will be competitive 
if these programs are not successful  our investment in research and development will not yield corresponding benefits to us 
our customers have the right to return our products in certain circumstances 
an excessive number of returns may reduce our revenues 
our customers have days from the date of purchase to return products that do not conform to an end user s requirements 
we may otherwise allow product returns if we think that doing so maximizes the effectiveness of our sales channels and promotes our reputation for quality and service 
although we estimate and reserve for potential returns in our reported financial results  actual returns could exceed our estimates 
if the number of returns exceeds our estimates  our financial results could be adversely impacted for the periods during which returns are made 
we may spend money pursuing sales that do not occur when anticipated or at all 
original equipment manufacturer customers typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they begin to market and sell new products 
this evaluation process is lengthy and may range from six months to one year or more 
this process is complex and may require significant sales  marketing  engineering and management resources on our part 
the process becomes more complex as we simultaneously qualify our products with multiple customers or pursue large orders with a single customer 
as a result  we may expend resources to develop customer relationships before we recognize any revenue from these relationships  if at all 
we sell a significant portion of our products to customers located outside the united states 
currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products unaffordable in foreign markets  which would reduce our revenue or profitability 
revenues from customers outside of north america were approximately of revenue for fiscal  of revenues for fiscal and of revenues for fiscal we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues 
our international sales subject us to a number of risks  including political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products  our ability to market our products in foreign countries  or our ability to obtain key components from suppliers  although we denominate our international sales in us dollars  currency fluctuations could make our products unaffordable to foreign purchasers or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers  restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets  greater difficulty of administering business overseas may increase the costs of foreign sales and support  foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas and taxes on our products  and longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the profitability of foreign sales 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our revenues or profitability 
a failure to develop and maintain proprietary technology may negatively affect our business 
we rely on copyright protection of electronic circuits and our firmware  as well as patent protection for some of our designs and products 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we do not believe our intellectual property rights provide significant protection from competition 
as a consequence  these rights may not preclude competitors from developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
in addition  many aspects of our products are not subject to intellectual property protection and therefore can be reproduced by our competitors 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in recent years  there has been a significant amount of litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
qualstar is not currently directly involved in any intellectual property litigation or proceedings 
in the future  we may become subject to other claims or inquiries regarding our alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  incorporating or using our products or services that use the challenged intellectual property  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology  which redesign may be either economically or technologically infeasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
our warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations 
we have established reserves for the estimated liability associated with our product warranties 
however  we could experience unforeseen circumstances where these or future reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to several factors  including general economic conditions affecting spending for information technology  increased competition and pricing pressures  reductions in the size  delays in the timing  or cancellation of significant customer orders  shifts in product or distribution channel mix  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of products by us  our original equipment manufacturer customers or our competitors  expansions or reductions in our relationships with value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer customers  financial difficulties affecting our value added reseller or original equipment manufacturer customers that render them unable to pay amounts owed to us  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products  new product developments by storage device manufacturers  such as disk drives  that could render our products less cost effective or less competitive  the rates of growth or decline in the data storage market and the various segments within it  timing and levels of our operating expenses  and availability of key components and performance of key suppliers 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock and this  in the aggregate  may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
our officers and directors could implement corporate actions that are not in the perceived best interests of our shareholders as a whole 
our executive officers and directors own beneficially  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of june  as a result  these shareholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the interests of our officers and directors  when acting in their capacity as shareholders  may lead them to vote for the election of directors who agree with the incumbent officers or directors preferred corporate policy  or oppose or support significant corporate transactions when these transactions further their interests as incumbent officers or directors  even if these interests diverge from their interests as shareholders per se and thus from the interests of other shareholders 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit your ability to receive a premium price for your shares 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the shareholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors and require shareholders to give advance notice if they wish to nominate directors or submit proposals for shareholder approval 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
trading in our stock has been limited and our stock price has been volatile 
consequently  it may be difficult to sell your shares 
there has been very little trading in shares of our stock and some days it does not trade at all 
this  as well as the factors listed below  has caused the price of our stock to be volatile 
consequently  it may be difficult to sell your shares of our stock at the price you paid for them or at a price equal to that quoted on the nasdaq stock market 
factors that may cause our stock price to fluctuate in the future include quarterly variations in operating results  especially if they differ from our previously announced forecasts or forecasts made by analysts  changes in or cancellation of our dividend payment policy  our announcements of anticipated future revenues or operating results  announcements concerning us  our competitors  our customers  or our industry  the introduction of new technology or products by us or our competitors  comments regarding us and the data storage market made by industry analysts or on internet bulletin boards  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  and changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many smaller public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
risks related to our tape library business the principal risks applicable specifically to our tape library operating segment are described below 
our principal competitors devote greater financial resources to developing  marketing and selling automated tape libraries 
consequently  we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share 
we face significant competition in developing and selling automated tape libraries 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
we have significantly fewer financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than many of our competitors and these limited resources may harm our business in many ways 
for example  in the past several years our competitors have acquired other tape library companies  increased the geographic scope of their market  offered a wider range of tape library products  and developed and acquired proprietary software and disk based products that operate in conjunction with their products and the products of their competitors 
in the future  our competitors may leverage their greater resources to develop  manufacture and market products that are less expensive or technologically superior to our products  attend more trade shows and spend more on advertising and marketing  reach a wider array of potential customers through a broader range of distribution channels  respond more quickly to new or changing technologies  customer requirements and standards  or reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share 
we believe competitive pressures are likely to continue 
we cannot guarantee that our resources will be sufficient to address this competition or that we will manage costs and adopt strategies capable of effectively utilizing our resources 
if we are unable to respond to competitive pressures successfully  our prices and profit margins may fall and our market share may decrease 
our lack of significant tape library segment order backlog makes it difficult to forecast future revenues and operating results 
we normally ship library products within a few days after orders are received 
consequently  we do not have significant order backlog and a large portion of our revenues in each quarter result from orders we received during that quarter 
because backlog can be an important indicator of future revenues  our lack of backlog makes it more difficult to forecast our future revenues 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  unexpected fluctuations in revenues could negatively impact our quarterly operating results 
our suppliers could reduce shipments of tape drives and tape media 
if this occurs  we would be forced to curtail production  our revenues could fall and our market share could decline 
automated tape libraries and related products  such as tape drives and tape media  represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal  of our revenues for fiscal  and approximately of our revenues for fiscal we depend on a limited number of third party manufacturers to supply us with the tape drives and tape media that we incorporate into our automated tape libraries 
some tape drive manufacturers  including ibm corporation  compete with us by also selling tape libraries 
there can be no assurance that other tape drive manufacturers will not also begin to manufacture or sell libraries 
in the past  some of these suppliers have been unable to meet demand for their products and have allocated their limited supply among customers 
if suppliers limit our supply of tape drives or tape media  we may be forced to delay or cancel shipments of our tape libraries 
the major supplier risks we face are the following the lto standard was developed by an industry consortium consisting of ibm  hewlett packard and quantum corporation 
all three drive suppliers also sell automated tape libraries that utilize lto tape drives and compete with our products 
therefore  even if we receive adequate allocation  it may be at a price that renders our products uncompetitive 
our other suppliers have in the past been  and may in the future be  unable to meet our demand  including our needs for timely delivery  adequate quantity and high quality 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our significant suppliers 
the partial or complete loss of any of our suppliers could result in lost revenue  added costs and production delays or could otherwise harm our business and customer relationships 
our revenues could decline if we fail to execute our distribution strategy successfully 
we distribute and sell our automated tape libraries through value added resellers and intend to continue this strategy for the foreseeable future 
value added resellers integrate our tape libraries with products of other manufacturers and sell the combined products to their own customers 
we currently devote  and intend to continue to devote  significant resources to develop and maintain these relationships 
a failure to initiate  manage and expand our relationships with value added resellers could limit our ability to grow or sustain our current level of revenues 
our focus on the distribution of our products through value added resellers poses the following risks we may reach fewer customers because we depend on value added resellers to market to end users and these value added resellers might fail to market effectively or fail to devote sufficient or effective sales  marketing and technical support to the sales of our products  we may lose sales because many of our value added resellers sell products that compete with our products 
these value added resellers may reduce their marketing efforts for our products in favor of products manufactured by our competitors  our costs may increase as value added resellers generally require a higher level of customer support than do original equipment manufacturers  and as the market for tape libraries matures  we expect that tape libraries designed for small and medium size businesses will not require the level of sales  marketing and technical support traditionally provided by value added resellers and  consequently  tape libraries for these customers will be increasingly sold through distribution channels rather than through value added resellers 
we do not have any exclusive agreements with our value added resellers  who purchase our products on an individual purchase order basis 
if we lose important value added resellers or if they reduce their focus on our products or if we are unable to obtain additional value added resellers  our business could suffer 
we rely on tape technology for a substantial part of our revenues 
our business will be harmed if demand for storage solutions using tape technology declines or fails to develop as we expect 
we derive the majority of our revenues from products that incorporate some form of tape technology 
we expect to derive a high percentage of our revenues from these products for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we will continue to be subject to the risk of a decrease in revenues if demand for these products declines or if rising prices make it more difficult to obtain them 
if products incorporating other technologies gain comparable or superior market acceptance and competitive price advantage  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely and materially affected unless we successfully develop and market products incorporating the new technology 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  or if our products do not contain the features required by the marketplace  we will eventually lose market share and sales to more innovative competitors 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the future success of qualstar will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology  to develop new and enhanced products on a timely and cost effective basis  and to introduce  manufacture and achieve market acceptance of these new and enhanced products 
in particular  our success will depend on increased market acceptance of our xls family of automated tape libraries 
our rls and tls families of tape libraries are facing increasing competition from products manufactured by our competitors 
development schedules for high technology products are inherently subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance we will be able to meet our product development schedules or that our development costs will be within budgeted amounts 
if the products or product enhancements developed are not deliverable due to technical problems  quality issues or component shortages  or if such products or product enhancements are not accepted by the marketplace or are unreliable  then our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the introduction of new storage technologies or the adoption of an industry standard different than our current product standards could render our existing products obsolete 
we depend upon independent software vendors to provide storage management software that makes our tape libraries functional 
the utility of an automated tape library depends upon the storage management software  which supports the library and integrates it into the user s computing environment to provide a complete storage solution 
we do not develop and have no control over the development of this storage management software 
instead we rely on third party independent software vendors to develop and support this software 
accordingly  the continued development and future growth of the market for our products will depend partly upon the success of software vendors to meet the overall data storage and management needs of tape library purchasers and our ability to maintain relationships with these firms 
although we do not have contracts with any third party independent software vendors  we maintain relationships with them by div supplying tape libraries so they can qualify their software to work with our tape libraries  evaluating their software for compatibility with our tape libraries  and keeping them informed as to current and contemplated changes to our products 
we may have to expend significant amounts of time and money defending or settling product liability claims arising from failures of our tape libraries 
because our tape library customers use our products to store and backup their important data  we face potential liability if our products fail to perform 
although we maintain general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance coverage could reduce our profitability or cause us to discontinue operations 
undetected flaws could increase our costs  reduce our revenues and divert resources from our core business needs 
our tape libraries are complex 
despite our efforts to revise and update our manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes  we may not be able to control and eliminate manufacturing flaws adequately 
these flaws may include undetected software or hardware defects associated with a newly introduced product  a new version of an existing product  or a product that has been integrated into a network storage solution with the products of other vendors 
the variety of contexts in which errors may arise may make it difficult to identify the source of a problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty  repair and replacement costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  cause significant customer relations problems  or damage our reputation 
to address these risks  we frequently revise and update manufacturing and test procedures to address engineering and component changes to our products 
if we fail to adequately monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes we could experience a rate of product failure that results in substantial shipment delays  repair or replacement costs or damage to our reputation 
product flaws may also consume our limited engineering resources and interrupt our development efforts 
significant product failures would increase our costs and result in the loss of future sales and be harmful to our business 
risks related to our power supply business the principal risks applicable specifically to our power supply operating segment are described below 
we primarily depend on two contract manufacturers for the majority of our power supplies 
loss of a supplier could harm our business 
the primary suppliers of our npower power supplies are located in china 
if a manufacturer should be unable to deliver products to us on a timely basis or at all  our power supply business could be adversely affected 
though we have many years of favorable experience with these suppliers  there can be no assurance that circumstances might not change and compel one or both of these suppliers to curtail or terminate deliveries to us 
long manufacturing lead times and parts shortages could result in delayed or lost sales  or excess inventory 
the use of contract manufacturers to manufacture our power supplies typically requires that we place production orders several months in advance of our expected need for the products 
this requires that we accurately anticipate our product needs in order to be able to fulfill orders from our customers on a timely basis 
if we are too conservative in our projected needs  we may not have sufficient inventory to sell to our customers  resulting in delayed or lost sales 
if we are too optimistic in our projected needs  we may order too much product inventory  some of which may become obsolete before we find a customer for it 
as the economy has recovered from the economic recession  we have experienced shortages of some parts needed to manufacture our power supplies 
this shortage of parts has exacerbated the lead time problem 
price erosion may have a material adverse effect on our margins and profitability 
the majority of the power supply manufactures that we compete with have substantially more resources and more models available than we do 
additionally the power supply business is generally characterized by intense competition 
there can be no assurances that a competitor will not choose to use its resources to under price our products in the market  thereby adversely affecting our sales or margins

item legal proceedings we are from time to time involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
at this time  we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us that we expect will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and liquidity or operating results 
legal claims are inherently uncertain  however 
we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected in the future by legal proceedings

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell automated magnetic tape libraries used to store  retrieve and manage electronic data primarily in network computing environments 
we currently offer tape libraries utilizing the lto tape drive technology 
many enterprises now routinely manage very large databases  in addition to storing information on local desktop computers 
this  coupled with the growth in the amount of data from new sources and applications  is increasing the need for managing and storing data efficiently 
we have developed tape libraries spanning a range of prices  capacity and performance 
we expect our products to continue to evolve in the future in response to emerging tape technologies and changing customer preferences 
we have developed a network of value added resellers who specialize in delivering complete storage solutions to end users 
end users of our products range from small businesses requiring simple automated backup solutions to large organizations needing complex storage management solutions 
we assist our customers with marketing  sales and technical support 
our international sales efforts are currently directed from our corporate offices in simi valley  california 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
net revenues from customers outside of north america were approximately million  or of revenues for fiscal  million  or of revenues for fiscal  and million  or of revenues for fiscal we also design  develop and sell high efficiency open frame switching power supplies used in telecommunications equipment  servers  routers  switches  raids  high efficiency lighting and similar applications 
our power supplies are sold under the npower brand name through independent sales representatives and distributors 
the primary customers are original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
we also utilize these power supplies in our tape libraries 
net revenues include revenues from the sale of tape libraries  tape drives  tape cartridges  ancillary products  and power supplies 
ancillary revenues include spare parts  service  repair  and on site service agreements net of the cost of any third party service contracts 
revenues from our tape library segment represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  of revenues in fiscal  and approximately of revenues in fiscal revenues from our power supply segment represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  of revenues in fiscal  and approximately of revenues in fiscal gross margins depend on several factors  including the cost of manufacturing  product mix and the level of competition 
larger tape libraries generally provide higher gross margins than do smaller tape libraries 
research and development activities include the design and development of new products  as well as enhancements to existing products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer promotional offers  sales returns  bad debts  inventories  warranty costs  investments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis fo r making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of title has occurred  the prices is fixed or readily determinable  and collectability is reasonable assured 
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock in simi valley  california  or another shipping location designated by us 
in general  these customers are allowed to return the product  free of penalty  within thirty days of shipment  if the product does not meet the end user s requirements 
we record an allowance for estimated sales returns based on past experience and current knowledge of our customer base 
our experience has been such that only a very small percentage of products are returned 
should our experience change  however  we may require additional allowances for sales returns 
marketable securities marketable securities consist primarily of high quality us corporate securities and us federal government debt securities 
our marketable securities portfolio consists of short term securities with original maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase and remaining maturities of less than one year and long term securities with original maturities of greater than one year and less than five years 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method  unrealized gains and losses are reflected in other comprehensive income until realized  realized gains and losses are included in earnings when the underlying securities are sold and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if normal market conditions do not return in the near future  we may be required to reduce the value of our investments through an impairment charge and reflect them as long term investments 
fair value of financial instruments we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures on july  for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability 
the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  not on assumptions specific to the entity 
in addition  the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non performance risk including our own credit risk 
in addition to defining fair value  asc expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs 
the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value is observable in the market 
each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels that are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
these levels are level inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models  and similar techniques 
in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as us treasuries and agency securities and exchange traded mutual funds 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
these investments are included in level and consist primarily of corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  and certain agency securities 
while we own certain mortgage backed fixed income securities  our portfolio as of june  does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or struct ured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a principal and interest guarantee  primarily from federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation 
our asset backed securities are senior tranches in regard to priority of principal repayment and are collateralized by predominantly prime rated receivables on consumer credit card  automobile loan and utility rate reduction securities 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific accounts and the overall condition of accounts receivable 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer credit worthiness and changes in customers payment terms and patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made this determination 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence  potential shrinkage  or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if technology changes more rapidly than expected  or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty obligations we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including active monitoring and evaluation of product failure rates  material usage and estimation of service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
however  should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
historically our warranty costs have not been significant 
share based compensation share based compensation is accounted for in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
the inputs we use for the model require the use of judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the stock  the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise  expected future dividends  and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and actual results could differ from these estimates  and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes we estimate our tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with asc  income taxes 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that ha s a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
we maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of net deferred tax assets in future years 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for such a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  the valuation allowance would be decreased accordingly 
we may periodically undergo examinations by the federal and state regulatory authorities and the internal revenue service 
we may be assessed additional taxes and or penalties contingent on the outcome of these examinations 
our previous examinations have not resulted in any unfavorable or significant assessments 
we have net operating losses  capital losses  research and development credit and other carryforwards for tax purposes of million at june  which expire between fiscal years and  except for the state research and development credit  which has no limit on the carryforward period 
results of operations the following table reflects  as a percentage of net revenues  statements of operations data for the periods indicated years ended june  net revenues cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative loss from operations investment income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss we have two operating segments for financial disclosure purposes tape libraries and power supplies  as discussed in footnote to our consolidated financial statements

net revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or is attributed primarily to a decrease of million in sales of tape libraries  partially offset by an increase of million in sales of power supplies 
tape library segment revenues attributed to our tape library segment were million  or of revenues in fiscal  as compared million  or of revenues in fiscal this decline in tape library revenues was due primarily to lower sales of our tape library products in the tls and rls product lines  partially offset by increased revenues from our xls product line  in conjunction with decreased sales of tape media and miscellaneous products 
we expect sales from our xls product line to increase in fiscal as this new generation of our tape library product line gains market acceptance 
however  we expect sales from our tls and rls product lines  as well as tape media  to decrease in fiscal power supply segment revenues attributed to our power supply segment were million  or of revenues  in fiscal as compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase of million  or  was due to increased sales to original equipment manufacturers and distributors of an expanded power supply product line 
we expect continued growth as a percentage of sales in our power supply revenues during fiscal gross profit

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available from the sale of our marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we may utilize cash to invest in businesses  products or technologies that we believe are strategic 
we periodically evaluate other companies and technologies for possible investment by us 
in addition  we have made and may in the future make investments in companies with whom we have identified potential synergies 
however  we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses or technologies 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our future payments due under contractual obligations as of june  year ended june operating leases purchase obligations total in thousands purchase obligations in the table above represent the value of open purchase orders as of june  we believe that some of these obligations could be canceled for payment of a nominal penalty or no penalty  however  the amount of open purchase orders that could be canceled under such terms is difficult to quantify 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in shorter duration fixed income securities 
we have no outstanding debt nor do we utilize derivative financial instruments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
