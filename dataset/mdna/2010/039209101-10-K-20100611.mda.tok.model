item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements the md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this report  including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto beginning on page f of this report and the subsection captioned disclosure regarding forward looking statements above 
historical results set forth in selected consolidated financial information and the financial statements beginning on page f and this section should not be taken as indicative of our future operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
identified below are some of the more significant accounting policies followed by the company in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see note description of company and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in general  the company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met  which typically is when evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided or goods have been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues for services are recorded in the period the services are rendered 
revenues for products are recorded in the period delivered based on sales prices established with the client or its insurer prior to delivery 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company reviews its accounts receivable balances on a periodic basis 
accounts receivable have been reduced by the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts is primarily based on historical analysis of the company s records 
the analysis is based on patient and institutional client payment histories  the aging of the accounts receivable  and specific review of patient and institutional client records 
as actual collection experience changes  revisions to the allowance may be required 
any unanticipated change in customers creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from customers could have a material effect on the results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all reasonable attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
goodwill the company has acquired several entities resulting in the recording of intangible assets  including goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
the company has three reporting units included in continuing operations services  pharmacy and catalog 
these reporting units are also the company s three reportable business segments 
the following table represents goodwill by reporting unit as of march services  pharmacy   total   the company conducts its annual goodwill impairment assessment during its fiscal fourth quarter 
we test for impairment between annual goodwill impairment assessments if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  the following i a significant adverse change in business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii unanticipated competition  or iv a decline in the market capitalization below net book value 
goodwill is tested using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill net book value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss islrecognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  the company uses an income approach to derive a present value of the reporting unit s projected future annual cash flows and the present residual value of the reporting unit 
the fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and the terminal value at the end of those five years 
the company uses a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows  which vary for each of the reporting units and include i future revenue growth rates  ii future operating profitability  iii the weighted average cost of capital and iv a terminal growth rate 
in addition  the company makes certain judgments about the allocation of corporate overhead costs in order to calculate the fair values of each of the company s reporting units 
estimates of future revenue and expenses associated with each reporting unit are the most sensitive of estimates related to the fair value calculations 
other factors considered in the fair value calculations include assumptions as to the business climate  industry and economic conditions 
the assumptions are subjective and different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of the impairment analyses 
in determining the appropriate assumptions  management considers historic trends as well as current activities and initiatives 
if the company s estimates and assumptions used in the discounted future cash flows should change at some future date  the company could incur an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs 
in addition to estimating fair value of the company s reporting units using the income approach  the company also estimates fair value using a market based approach which relies on values based on market multiples derived from comparable public companies 
the company uses the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the market based approach to validate the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the income approach 
intangible assets acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized using the economic benefit method when reliable information regarding future cash flows is available and the straight line method when this information is unavailable 
the estimated useful lives are as follows trade name years customer relationships depending on the type of business purchased to years income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized currently for the future tax consequences attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as for tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred tax asset 
judgment is used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets and review the amount of such allowance periodically 
when we determine certain deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be utilized  we will reduce our valuation allowance accordingly 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
internal revenue code section rules limit the utilization of net operating losses following a change in control of a company 
it has been determined that a change in control of the company took place at the time of the reverse merger in therefore  the company s ability to utilize certain net operating losses generated by critical home care will be subject to severe limitations in future periods  which could have an effect of eliminating substantially all the future income tax benefits of the respective net operating losses 
tax benefits from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded at such time as they are considered more likely than not to be realized

home care revenue as a percentage of the total segment revenue continues to increase  reaching of such revenue during fiscal home care revenues fell by  or  from  to  over the prior year 
home care revenues were adversely affected by several factors  including reductions in hours reimbursement rates by state sponsored programs in some of the company s key markets such as arizona  north carolina  washington and california  high unemployment rates  particularly in the state of michigan where the company has substantial operations  resulting in increased availability of family caregivers to provide care in lieu of our services  and the significant reduction in the value of individual retirement savings and investment accounts during and  resulting in some reduction in the hours of services purchased 
the negative trends in the medical staffing and travel staffing markets continued during fiscal medical staffing and travel staffing declined by and  respectively  as compared with the prior year 
several factors have contributed to the lower level of overall sales 
market conditions for temporary medical staffing are currently not favorable  driven by lower patient censuses in facilities  constraints on facility staffing budgets  the return of part time staff to full time status and increases in overtime accepted by permanent staff of our potential customers  largely in response to overall economic conditions  and delays in the construction and opening of new facilities that often drives short term staffing requirements 
in addition to these market conditions  travel staffing revenues have been adversely affected by state budget constraints with a major correctional institution customer 
gross margin in the home care and medical staffing business was for both fiscal and while the overall mix of higher margin home care business increased as a percentage of total revenues  this gross margin benefit was offset by several factors 
these factors included a reduction in margins on several state sponsored home care programs  such as arizona  north carolina  washington and california  a reduction in the percentage of business generated in some of the company s higher margin offices and markets  including the state of michigan  and an overall decline in the margins in the medical staffing business due to changes in staffing business mix 
in addition  in the fiscal fourth quarter  the company experienced an increase in state unemployment taxes in many of the states in which it operates 
pharmacy segment the revenue in the pharmacy segment increased by  or  to  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
this growth was driven by the company s dailymed program 
during the second half of fiscal  revenue generated from the dailymed medication management program began to increase at a rapid pace  and the company continues to pursue additional opportunities with government entities and managed care organizations 
the revenue growth in fiscal was primarily driven by the company s relationship with wellpoint 
the company continues to work with the indiana medicaid program and its managed care providers to identify and enroll those patients who will benefit most from participation in the dailymed program 
additionally  in june  the company announced the signing of an agreement with wellpoint 
under this agreement  the company will initiate the dailymed medication management program to wellpoint s high risk medicaid members in five states where wellpoint companies provide medicaid managed care benefits 
the five states are california  virginia  new york  kansas and south carolina 
the program was launched to wellpoint s high risk members in virginia in august  and the company began recognizing revenue from these patients in september the program was rolled out to wellpoint s california patients during fiscal fourth quarter  and it will be rolled out to patients in the remaining three states during the first half of fiscal the company anticipates the majority of its pharmacy revenue growth over the next several quarters to be attributable to the wellpoint arrangement 
the costs of revenue in the pharmacy segment include the cost of medications and packaging for the dailymed proprietary dispensing system 
gross margins for fiscal were compared to for the prior year 
in general  the margins have been negatively impacted by shifts in the payer and patient mix as the pharmacy segment s revenue grows 
the revenue growth during fiscal was primarily driven by the indiana medicaid program and the wellpoint patients in virginia 
the margins associated with these patients are lower due to a combination of lower reimbursement rates and the brand generic drug mix where generic drugs have lower margins than brand drugs 
management expects margins to improve during fiscal due to a new prime vendor agreement entered into in april as well as other on going operational initiatives  including more aggressive purchasing efforts  and technology improvements 
in the future  margins will continue to be impacted by the changing payer and patient mix as the pharmacy patient and revenue base grows 
catalog segment revenue from the company s catalog and internet based home health products business decreased to  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease in revenue is due in part to the reduction in catalog mailing to a more targeted audience  and in part due to economic conditions as virtually all of this business is cash and or credit business 
the gross margin increased to during fiscal compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross margin is largely related to the mix of business between our mail order catalog and on line sales revenue 
selling  general and administrative the following table summarizes selling  general and administrative expenses by segment for the fiscal years ended march in thousands of total of total increase increase sg a sg a decrease decrease services   pharmacy    catalog  corporate   sg a as a of net revenue services segment the services segment selling  general and administrative expense decreased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this  or  decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in commissions paid to the affiliates  a  decrease in bad debt expense and a  decrease in labor costs 
affiliate commissions are based on the gross margins of the individual affiliates  and the decrease reflects a decrease in revenues and gross margins generated from the affiliate owned locations 
the decrease in bad debt expense is due to a combination of higher than normal bad debt expense in the prior year and an increased focus on collection efforts during fiscal the decrease in labor costs was a direct result of the company s efforts to reduce headcount in certain areas 
pharmacy segment the pharmacy segment selling  general and administrative expense increased by  or  to  during fiscal compared to fiscal in general  the increase in pharmacy expenses was due to the significant growth in revenue in this segment year over year 
specifically  total labor costs increased by  during fiscal as the company hired additional pharmacists  pharmacy technicians  and customer service representatives in order to process the increased volume and to support the patient care component of the dailymed program 
with patient enrollment efforts associated with the wellpoint agreement  the company also incurred  in costs associated with an external call center during fiscal shipping costs and bad debt expense also increased during the period by  and  respectively  which was consistent with the revenue growth 
the remaining increase during the current year was due to various other administrative expenses  including travel  marketing materials  and various service fees  that increased with the growth in revenue and headcount that has occurred over the last year 
the dailymed program includes a significant level of patient care and value added services designed to improve compliance  adherence and safety of a patient s medication regimen 
these pharmacy services include consolidation  synchronization and transfer of prescriptions and medication therapy management mtm services 
the company makes a significant investment in these services as they are a key part to achieving the patient benefits and health care cost reductions associated with dailymed 
the company s business model contemplates that payers will be willing to share some of these cost savings as they are realized either through a per member per month fee or some type of cost savings arrangement 
to date  the company has not recognized any revenue for these services 
the company has elected to provide these services to indiana medicaid customers without a cost sharing arrangement as indiana medicaid has entered into a research agreement with the purdue university school of pharmacy to study dailymed s ability to reduce total health care costs 
catalog segment the catalog segment selling  general and administrative expense decreased by  or  during fiscal these decreases were primarily due to a  decrease in the costs to produce and mail catalogs 
corporate corporate selling  general and administrative expense decreased by  or  to  for fiscal compared to  for the prior year 
the slight decrease reflects a general reduction in the corporate overhead necessary to operate the business subsequent to the various business divestitures during the fiscal first quarter these reductions were offset by increases in legal fees as the number of claims and disputes arising during the normal course of business was higher in fiscal than fiscal  and  equity compensation  which was higher in fiscal due to a stock option grant to senior management in march which vested immediately resulting in a  charge during fiscal fourth quarter depreciation and amortization the following table summarizes depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal years ended march in thousands increase increase decrease decrease depreciation and amortization of property and equipment   amortization of acquired intangible assets depreciation and amortization operating expense  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased by  or  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase reflects the increase in depreciation associated with pharmacy equipment acquired during the last year and various software 
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by  or  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease reflects the fact that as of march   the company recognized certain impairment charges relating to amortizable intangible assets associated with the pharmacy and catalog segments  which ultimately reduced amortization expense 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment as of the end of fiscal year  the company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis for the two reporting units with remaining goodwill balances at that time services and pharmacy 
the service segment is a mature business that has been in existence for more than years 
over this period of time  the business has experienced periods of growth and decline  similar to other businesses and industries 
over the last two years  the segment as a whole has seen declining revenue  and this decline has been primarily driven by a decline in the medical staffing and travel staffing businesses 
many of the service s segments locations provide both home care and medical staffing services 
during fiscal  home care accounted for of total segment revenue  and medical staffing and travel staffing  in the aggregate  accounted for the remaining of revenue 
the medical staffing and travel staffing business experienced a decline in revenue from fiscal to fiscal during this same period  home care revenue increased by  but fiscal revenue was approximately lower than fiscal while management believes that the market for temporary medical staffing services will eventually improve  the timing and extent of such improvement is uncertain and there could be further declines before such recovery occurs 
in addition  while management believes that its home care business will grow as population demographics drive increased demand  in the near term  such growth will depend in part on the improvement in the overall us economy and the extent to which state funded programs experience additional funding cut backs 
because management s ability to predict the timing and extent of these factors is subject to some uncertainty  it focused on more recent trends in the annual impairment analysis  which resulted in lower future cash flow projections than in prior years analyses 
the impairment analysis resulted in a  goodwill impairment charge for fiscal  and subsequent to this charge  there is no remaining goodwill associated with the services segment 
in conjunction with the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis as described below  the company recognized a  goodwill impairment charge in the pharmacy reporting unit 
subsequent to the impairment charge  the pharmacy segment has  of remaining goodwill 
as evidenced by the growth in its year over year revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  the pharmacy segment continued to advance its dailymed business during fiscal  but it remains in the early stages of development 
management believes that the dailymed program will be the primary growth driver for the company as a whole over the next several years 
in performing the goodwill impairment analysis for the pharmacy reporting unit during the fiscal fourth quarter  management relied on recent trends and future expectations based on these trends and industry experience to project future operating results 
the fiscal revenue estimates were based on payer relationships that existed as of the time of the analysis 
the revenue estimates in the future years assume new payer relationships similar to the wellpoint relationship 
additionally  management assumed margin improvement over the next five years due to increased volume  operational improvements and additional revenue from medication adherence services  which are expected to generate higher margins than drug revenue 
management also estimated that sg a as a percentage of revenue will improve due to software and technological enhancements as well as efficiencies gained through volume and experience 
as of march   the pharmacy reporting unit analysis indicated that its fair value was in excess of it carrying value by approximately so the second step of the analysis was not considered necessary 
the primary events that could negatively affect the pharmacy assumptions would be the inability to add additional payer relationships  improve margins  and or reduce the labor costs as much as expected 
fiscal the following summarizes the goodwill and intangible asset impairment expense for fiscal acquired intangible goodwill assets total pharmacy    catalog goodwill and intangible asset impairment total   as of the end of fiscal  the company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis for all three of its reporting units services  catalog and pharmacy 
in the impairment analysis of the services reporting unit performed as of march   management assumed a modest revenue growth rate in future years  which was approximately consistent with the recent trends in the home health care industry 
management also assumed that margins over the next five years would remain consistent and that sg a would improve in fiscal and then increase slightly in the years thereafter 
as of march   the services reporting unit analysis indicated that its fair value was in excess of it carrying value by approximately so the second step of the analysis was not considered necessary 
the pharmacy goodwill was originally recognized during the fiscal year ended march  in conjunction with the prairiestone pharmacy  llc acquisition in february at the time of the acquisition  prairiestone marketed several pharmacy related products and services  including the dailymed medication management system and a license service model whereby it contracted with regional retail chain pharmacies to provide pharmacy expertise and access to a restricted third party network 
the various prairiestone offerings were in the early stages of development  and company management believed that they could complement the goods and services being offered by arcadia resources  inc at the time 
subsequent to the acquisition  management began to focus on the dailymed product because of its perceived potential  and  to date  the company has not worked to expand the other prairiestone offerings 
as of march   the dailymed business was in its early stages and lacked meaningful historic financial trends 
additionally  the anticipated growth in the pharmacy reporting unit had experienced several delays 
in performing the goodwill impairment analysis for the pharmacy unit during fiscal fourth quarter  management acknowledged these issues and the difficulty in projecting the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flow streams  which are the basis for the fair value estimates of the reporting unit 
management was obligated to temper its estimates of future cash flows from the pharmacy business until such time as those cash flows have started to actually be realized with sustained regularity 
the impairment analysis resulted in a  impairment charge for fiscal subsequent to the impairment charge   of goodwill remains in the pharmacy reporting unit 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment  the company also recognized an impairment expense relating to the pharmacy segment s customer relationships of during the fourth quarter fiscal  the company performed the goodwill impairment analysis for the catalog reporting unit 
the analysis indicated that the carrying value was in excess of the fair value due to the financial performance of this business unit falling short of original projections and the general expectation that the catalog business may not grow significantly in the near term due to management s focus on the other lines of business 
the company recorded an impairment charge relating to the catalog reporting unit of  subsequent to the impairment charge  no goodwill remains related to the catalog reporting unit 
the company also recognized a  impairment of the catalog s customer relationships 
interest expense and income the following table summarizes interest expense and income for the fiscal years ended march in thousands increase increase decrease decrease interest expense   interest income interest expense for fiscal decreased by  or  to  as compared to the prior year 
total interest expense includes the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs of  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the average interest bearing liabilities balance sum of the balances at the end of each quarter divided by the number of quarters for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  which represents a reduction of 
the overall reduction of debt combined with the reduction in the amount of amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs resulted in the decrease in interest expense 
loss on extinguishment of debt the following table summarizes the components of the loss on extinguishment of debt for the fiscal year ended march  in thousands jana vicis debt refinancing value of equity  write off of remaining debt discount amerisourcebergen line of credit amendment loss on extinguishment of debt total  in conjunction with the march  debt refinancing with jana and vicis  the company recognized  as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
the company issued  shares of common stock valued at  to the lenders as consideration for providing the additional financing and extending the maturity date of the previously existing debt 
the company also exchanged  warrants held by two of the lenders vicis and jana for  shares of common stock and the incremental fair value was determined to be  concurrent with the debt refinancing  the holders of the warrants issued in conjunction with the may private placement transaction agreed to exchange a total of  warrants for  shares of common stock with an incremental fair value of  on march   the company entered into a  note payable agreement with vicis  which had a corresponding debt discount of  in conjunction with the march  debt refinancing with jana and vicis  the remaining debt discount of  was charged to loss on extinguishment of debt 
on june   the company issued amerisourcebergen  warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of the warrants was determined to be  and was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
no similar expense was recognized during fiscal change in fair value of warrant liability as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the  warrants issued in november in conjunction with the equity financing transaction are recorded as a liability at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the warrants are determined using the black scholes pricing model and is affected by changes in inputs to that model  including our stock price  expected stock price volatility  and contractual terms 
to the extent that the fair value of the warrant liability increases or decreases  the company records a loss or gain in the statement of operations 
the gain of  on the change in fair value of the warrant liability during fiscal was primarily due to the changes in our stock price 
income taxes income tax expense was  for the year ended march  compared to  for the year ended march   a decrease of  this income tax reduction is primarily a result of a decrease in the estimated amounts due for michigan business tax and refunds resulting from overpayments of fiscal state tax returns as filed 
due to the company s losses in recent years  it has paid nominal federal income taxes 
for federal income tax purposes  the company had significant permanent and timing differences between book income and taxable income resulting in combined net deferred tax asset balance to be utilized by the company for which an offsetting valuation allowance has been established for the entire amount 
the company has a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes totaling million that expires at various dates through internal revenue code section rules limit the utilization of certain of these net operating loss carryforwards upon a change of control of the company 
it has been determined that a change in control took place at the time of the reverse merger in  and as such  the utilization of  of the net operating loss carryforwards will be subject to severe limitations in future periods

during fiscal  home care revenues increased approximately over the same period in the previous year 
a majority of this increase represents organic growth in several of the company s main geographic markets 
the increase in sales included growth in government programs served  as well as private pay and insurance clients 
the growth in home care revenues was approximately offset by significant year over year declines in revenue in the medical staffing and travel staffing markets  which declined by approximately and  respectively  as compared with the prior year 
demand for the company s per diem and travel medical staffing services declined as compared with the same period a year ago 
several factors have contributed to the lower level of overall demand  including lower patient censuses in facilities  constraints on facility staffing budgets  the return of part time staff to full time status and increases in overtime accepted by permanent staff of our potential customers  largely in response to overall economic conditions  and delays in the construction and opening of new facilities that often drives short term staffing requirements 
gross margins in the home care medical staffing segment increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the cost of revenues in this segment consists primarily of employee costs  including wages  taxes  fringe benefits and workers compensation expense 
the year over year improvement in gross margins was driven primarily by two factors 
the first was a reduction in workers compensation expense  reflecting the success of the company s on going efforts to control and reduce these costs through improved training  timelier reporting and investigation of claims  and reduced administrative costs 
the second factor was the increased mix of home care revenue as a percentage of sales  with margins in this market being significantly higher than gross margins in medical and travel staffing 
pharmacy segment the revenue in the pharmacy segment increased by during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to its dailymed programs 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  revenue generated from the company s dailymed medication management program began to increase at a more rapid pace than in previous quarters 
pharmacy revenue in fiscal included  of revenue for retail pharmacy management services 
no such revenue was generated in fiscal the costs of revenue in the pharmacy segment include the cost of medications sold to clients and packaging costs for the dailymed proprietary dispensing system 
the reduction in the gross margin percentage from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the change in revenue mix 
specifically  the pharmacy management services revenue generated in fiscal had nominal costs of revenue associated with it 
catalog segment revenue from the company s catalog and internet based home health products business were previously included as part of the hhe business segment 
catalog business sales decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in revenue is consistent the company s change in approach  which began in mid  with the goal of becoming more profitable in part by printing and with fewer catalogs to a more targeted audience

pharmacy segment the increase in the pharmacy segment selling  general and administrative expense from  in fiscal to  in fiscal was due to the following the company s investment in the infrastructure and additional employees necessary to support the expected growth in the pharmacy segment 
management anticipates the pharmacy sg a as a percentage of revenue to decrease moving forward as the additional investments in infrastructure decrease 
the company consolidated its paducah  kentucky pharmacy operations into its new indianapolis  indiana pharmacy during the fiscal quarter ended december  during the transition period  both pharmacies were open for approximately two months 
the company incurred severance costs associated with the ultimate closure of the paducah location 
the company incurred approximately  in expenses relating to the wind down of the paducah pharmacy and the severance costs 
catalog segment the catalog segment selling  general and administrative expense decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due to a decrease in catalog production and mailing costs as the company changed its approach in an attempt to increase profitability by printing and sending fewer catalogs to a more targeted audience 
corporate the  increase in corporate selling  general and administrative expense during fiscal was due to the following a change in the classification of certain employees who were previously included in the services segment to corporate 
historically  employees in the southfield  michigan location supported the services segment almost exclusively 
during fiscal  the company centralized many of its corporate functions in southfield  michigan  and these employees now support the entire organization 
beginning in fiscal  the company began to more accurately separate and record these corporate functions from the segment specific functions  and beginning in fiscal  corporate absorbed all insurance expense in a effort to consolidate and review all policies 
during fiscal  insurance expense was charged to the various segments 
this resulted in a  increase in corporate sg a expenses 
on a consolidated basis  insurance expense increased by approximately  in fiscal these increases were partially offset by the following in the third quarter of fiscal  the company hired an in house legal counsel  and as a result  legal fees decreased significantly during fiscal additionally  audit fees and fees relating to sarbanes oxley requirements decreased due to the reduced audit requirements when the company became a non accelerated filer in fiscal in the aggregate  professional fees decreased by approximately  during fiscal the reduction of equity compensation expense 
during the fiscal second quarter  the company recognized approximately  relating to the vesting of certain stock options consistent with the former ceo s separation agreement executed in july the expense did not repeat in fiscal depreciation and amortization the following table summarizes depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal years ended march in thousands increase increase decrease decrease depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  amortization of acquired intangible assets  depreciation and amortization operating expense   depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased by approximately  or  during the year ended march  compared to the prior year 
this increase reflects the increase in depreciation associated with various software and computer equipment acquired over the last two years 
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by  or  during the year ended march  the decrease reflects the decrease in the amortization associated with customer relationships 
the company primarily uses the economic benefit method of amortizing intangible assets  which attempts to match the amortization expense with the anticipated economic benefit of the asset as determined at the time of the acquisition 
the estimated economic benefit typically decreases as more time passes since the acquisition 
as such  the corresponding amortization expense also decreases 
as discussed below  the company wrote off  in acquired amortizable intangible assets during the fiscal fourth quarter of this will significantly reduce the amortization expense in future years 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment no goodwill or intangible asset impairment expense was recognized in continuing operations during fiscal the following summarizes the goodwill and intangible asset impairment expense for fiscal acquired intangible goodwill assets total pharmacy    catalog goodwill and intangible asset impairment total   in accordance with our policy  as of the end of fiscal year  the company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis for all three of our reporting units services  catalog and pharmacy 
the services reporting unit is a mature business so historic trends within this business unit and the industry are the primary consideration in determining appropriate assumptions 
revenue estimates are based on a combination of recent trends and future expectations within the reporting unit and the industry as a whole 
expense estimates are primarily based on internal trends and likely changes to these trends based on known information or current initiatives 
in our impairment analysis performed as of march   management assumed revenue growth rates consistent with recent trends in the home health care industry 
management also assumed that margins over the next five years would remain consistent at between and compared to margins of recognized in fiscal with regards to total selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the services reporting unit  management assumed that it would decrease by approximately for the year ended march  and then slightly increase in the years thereafter 
the decrease in sg a expenses in the first year of the projections reflects the impact of certain charges taken fiscal as well as the benefits of various cost reduction initiatives 
in the projections  the total sg a is impacted by the amount of corporate allocation charged to the services segment 
the company believes that the pharmacy segment will grow significantly over the next several years  and as this growth occurs  the amount of fixed corporate overhead allocated to the pharmacy will increase with a corresponding decrease to the services segment 
as of march   the services reporting unit analysis indicated that its fair value was in excess of it carrying value by approximately so the second step of the analysis was not considered necessary 
the primary events that could negatively affect the services assumptions would be the inability to grow revenue either due to lack of internal execution or to overall economic conditions or a combination thereof 
the pharmacy goodwill was originally recognized during the fiscal year ended march  in conjunction with the prairiestone pharmacy  llc prairiestone acquisition in february at the time of the acquisition  prairiestone marketed several pharmacy related products and services  including the dailymed medication management system and a license service model whereby it contracted with regional retail chain pharmacies to provide pharmacy expertise and access to a restricted third party network 
the various prairiestone offerings were in the early stages of development  and company management believed that they could complement the goods and services being offered by the company at the time 
subsequent to the acquisition  management began to focus on the dailymed product because of its perceived potential  and the company has not worked to expand the other prairiestone offerings 
the dailymed business is in its early stages and lacks meaningful historic financial trends 
additionally  the anticipated growth in the pharmacy reporting unit has experienced several delays to date 
in performing the goodwill impairment analysis for the pharmacy unit during fiscal fourth quarter  management acknowledged these issues and the difficulty in projecting the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flow streams  which are the basis for the fair value estimates of the reporting unit 
management was obligated to temper its estimates of future cash flows from the pharmacy business until such time as those cash flows have started to actually be realized with sustained regularity 
the impairment analysis resulted in a  impairment charge for fiscal subsequent to the impairment charge   of goodwill remains in the pharmacy reporting unit 
management does not believe that the historic financial performance of the pharmacy segment is indicative of future results and continues to believe that the pharmacy business is the primary revenue growth driver for the company as a whole 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment  the company recognized also an impairment expense relating to the pharmacy segment s customer relationships of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed the goodwill impairment analysis for the catalog reporting unit 
the analysis indicated that the carrying value was in excess of the fair value due to the financial performance of this business unit falling short of original projections and the general expectation that the catalog business may not grow significantly in the near term due to management s focus on the other lines of business 
the company recorded an impairment charge relating to the catalog reporting unit of  subsequent to the impairment charge  no goodwill remains related to the catalog reporting unit

the decrease in interest expense during the current year was due to the reduction in interest bearing liabilities as well as a reduction in the interest rates on certain borrowings

the fair value of the warrants was determined to be  and was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
income taxes income tax expense was  for the year ended march  compared to  for the year ended march   a decrease of  this income tax reduction is primarily the result of adjusting the march  accrued state income tax liabilities for the state of michigan as a result of a change in the method of taxation for businesses effective january  previous to this change  the expense related to the single business tax sbt was primarily a tax on compensation 
the cost of revenues for the services segment is primarily compensation and  as such  the sbt expense was included in the cost of revenues 
effective january   the expenses associated with the new michigan business tax were recorded in the income tax line item due to its primary taxation on income as opposed to compensation 
due to the company s losses in recent years  it has paid nominal federal income taxes 
for federal income tax purposes  the company had significant permanent and timing differences between book income and taxable income resulting in combined net deferred tax assets of million to be utilized by the company for which an offsetting valuation allowance has been established for the entire amount 
the company has a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes totaling million that expires at various dates through internal revenue code section rules limit the utilization of certain of these net operating loss carryforwards upon a change of control of the company 
it has been determined that a change in control took place at the time of the reverse merger in  and as such  the utilization of  of the net operating loss carryforwards will be subject to severe limitations in future periods

pharmacy operations on june   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with a leading pharmacy management company to sell substantially all of the assets of jascorp  llc jascorp for proceeds of  less estimated fees of   of the purchase price was held back by the buyer until december in order to cover the company s contingent obligations 
jascorp operates the retail pharmacy software business that the company acquired in september as part of the divestiture  the company entered into a license and services agreement with the buyer that provides the company the right to use the software for internal purposes 
the net loss for the pharmacy discontinued operations was  industrial staffing operations on may   the company finalized the sale of substantially all of the assets of its industrial and non medical staffing business for cash proceeds of  which will be paid in five equal installments through september additionally  the company will receive of the future earnings of the business until the total payments equal million 
such payments  if any  will be recorded as additional gains when earned 
the company retained all accounts receivable for services provided prior to may  the net loss for the industrial staffing discontinued operations was liquidity and capital resources during the first quarter  the company finalized the sale of its hhe  industrial staffing and pharmacy software businesses 
subsequent to these divestitures  the company narrowed its focus to a single vision of keeping people at home and healthier longer and to improving the performance of its two remaining core business units home care medical staffing services and pharmacy 
management has been focused on growing revenues and improving the profitability within each segment  implementing cost reductions to better align the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses with current business levels and ensuring the company has adequate financial resources and liquidity to fund its business plans 
within the pharmacy segment  revenue increased by more than year over year to million in fiscal in june  the company entered into an agreement with wellpoint whereby the company will provide its dailymed medication management program to wellpoint s high risk medicaid members in five states where wellpoint companies provide medicaid managed care benefits through its state sponsored business division 
the program was launched to wellpoint s high risk members in virginia in august the program is being rolled out to wellpoint s california and south carolina patients  and enrollment in kansas and new york is expected to begin the first half of fiscal the wellpoint agreement  combined with the company s relationship with the indiana medicaid program and other payers  provides the company with a significant growth opportunity within its pharmacy segment 
as the pharmacy business grows  management expects more payers will become aware of and interested in the unique benefits of the dailymed program 
additionally  the national focus on healthcare has increased awareness of the importance of medication adherence and the need for solutions that reduce costs by enabling people to take medications properly and safely while remaining in their homes 
as a result  management believes that the pharmacy segment will establish additional payer relationships over the next several years  which will drive revenue growth well in excess of that generated from the existing payer relationships 
the long term success of the pharmacy business depends heavily on the continued growth in revenue  improvement in margins  the ability to reduce sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue  and additional revenue from cost sharing agreements 
management believes that the company s continued focus on reducing healthcare costs and establishing relationships with payers will ultimately provide the necessary revenue growth to allow the company to leverage its current sg a structure 
the pharmacy segment entered into a new prime vendor agreement in april this new agreement combined with various on going operational initiatives and software enhancements is expected to improve gross margins during fiscal sg a expenses are expected to decline as a percentage of revenue due to operational improvements  investments in new operating systems and technology  and leveraging more fixed expenses over a larger revenue base 
the combination of revenue growth  improved margins and lower sg a expenses is expected to reduce the operating losses and cash needed to fund the pharmacy business 
however  it is expected that the pharmacy segment will continue to be a net user of cash through most of fiscal within the services segment  the company has maintained its home care revenue despite challenging economic conditions and high levels of unemployment  which both negatively impacted home care demand in the short term 
management continues to explore cost effective ways to organically grow the home care revenue 
at the same time  the company has seen a significant reduction in medical staffing revenue consistent with overall staffing industry trends 
the company has reduced the sg a in this segment over the last months and will continue to look for additional cost saving opportunities 
management expects these on going initiatives to improve the service segment results during fiscal at current levels of revenue  it is unlikely that the profitability of the services segment will be sufficient to offset the losses and cash usage in the pharmacy segment 
however  when revenues return to more historic levels as the home care business grows and the medical staffing market recovers  the services segment is expected to see an improvement in operating income and cash flow 
the company continues to have a negative cash flow on a monthly basis as the pharmacy losses and corporate expenses exceed the cash flows generated by the services segment 
in addition  certain financial covenants exist with lenders that could limit the company s flexibility and financing options 
while management believes that the company s financial performance will improve during fiscal and move toward profitability and positive cash flow in fiscal  there are many actions that must be successfully implemented by the management team in order to achieve these goals 
in november  the company finalized an equity financing transaction and raised  in net cash proceeds 
consistent with the terms of the debt agreement dated september   the company used  of the proceeds to pay off the outstanding balance 
the remaining  is being used to fund on going operations 
in april  and in conjunction with the pharmacy s new prime vendor agreement  the company executed a million line of credit and security agreement with its new vendor 
the interest rate is the greater of and the prime rate plus  and the term of the loan is for three years 
the total amount available under this financing arrangement is million less amounts due for normal vendor payables and for accrued interest 
no interest payments are due during the first months of the agreement 
beginning in april  no additional advances will be made if the pharmacy segment s borrowing base does not exceed certain thresholds 
management believes that the additional cash raised over the last six months will provide the company with the capital necessary to support operating cash requirements in the near term as the financial performance improves 
if and when necessary  management believes that it would be able to raise additional capital to support on going operations and to fund growth opportunities 
this capital could be in the form of debt or equity financing 
while there are some synergies between the services and pharmacy businesses  each could operate as standalone businesses and each could be sold to  or have investment made by  strategic or financial investors to fund operations and other growth opportunities 
in addition to the normal financing opportunities as described above  this provides further financing flexibility should there be a need for additional capital to support the growth within one or both segments 
the above discussion represents management s intentions as of june there can be no assurances that any actions contemplated or available will be successfully undertaken or that management will not change its plans 
the following summarizes the company s cash flows for all operations for the fiscal years ended march  in thousands net loss    net cash provided by used in operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities   net change in cash and cash equivalents    cash and cash equivalents  end of year    availability under line of credit agreement  at march   the company had  in cash and line of credit availability compared to  at march   an increase of  the line of credit balance fluctuates based on working capital needs 
the increase in cash plus line of credit availability reflects the net increase in cash provided by investing and financing activities  specifically the cash raised in conjunction with an equity financing transaction in november as more fully described below 
the line of credit availability is based on the eligible accounts receivable within the services segment 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily driven by the operating losses generated by the pharmacy segment and the loss of earnings generated from the operations of the businesses disposed of during the fiscal first quarter these losses were partially offset by the increase in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal of  compared to a decrease of  in fiscal this working capital improvement in fiscal was primarily driven by the collection of the receivables retained subsequent to the sale of the hhe and industrial staffing businesses during fiscal first quarter and the improved collection efforts of accounts receivable in the services segment 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal of  included  of cash proceeds from the various business disposals in early fiscal these cash proceeds were offset by  in capital expenditures   in cash paid relating to certain business acquisitions  and  of cash used to establish a restricted cash account at comerica bank used as additional security for the services segment line of credit

proceeds from business disposals includes the proceeds from the sale of the california hhe operations in january of  and a final payment of  relating to the sale of its florida hhe operations during fiscal cash provided by investing activities for fiscal included  received upon the sale of the florida and colorado hhe operations  offset by  of cash used for acquisitions  primarily the  used to purchase jascorp  llc in july capital expenditures for fiscal of  were consistent with fiscal capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was  in november  the company raised  in additional equity financing  net of fees paid in cash of  in september  the company received  in additional debt financing  net of fees  and this amount was paid in full upon completion of the equity financing in november 
during fiscal  the company made  in debt and capital lease payments 
the majority of these payments were made subsequent to the various business divestitures during fiscal first quarter and consistent with terms in the certain debt agreements 
the company also reduced its outstanding line of credit balance by  during fiscal cash used in financing activities for fiscal consisted of a  reduction in the outstanding line of credit balance and  in principal payments on outstanding notes payable and capital leases 
in march  the company secured an additional  in debt financing 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was  in may  the company raised  in cash through a private placement of its common stock 
a significant portion of the proceeds from the private placement and the disposal of the florida and colorado hhe locations was used to pay down outstanding debt 
as of march   the company had total debt obligations of  of which  and  were payable to jana and vicis  respectively  and mature in april both jana and vicis own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
additionally  the company had outstanding balances of  due to comerica bank and  due to amerisourcebergen drug corporation 
the balance due amerisourcebergen drug corporation was paid in full in april see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more detail on these debt agreements 
on april   the company executed a line of credit and security agreement with hd smith wholesale drug co 
hd smith  its new primary supplier of pharmaceutical products 
under terms of the agreement  the company can borrow up to  including amounts payable under normal product purchasing terms 
beginning april   borrowings under the agreement will be limited based upon a borrowing base of the assets of the pharmacy business 
the debt accrues interest at the greater of and the prime rate plus  and it matures on april  interest during the first months of the agreement will be capitalized and then interest only payments are required from may through april beginning with may  the company will make monthly payments of  plus interest 
borrowing may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the agreement includes certain financial covenants beginning in fiscal in conjunction with the financing  the company issued hd smith warrants to purchase common stock  and the warrant terms are more fully described in note the debt agreements with jana  vicis and lsp partners require the lenders consent for debt transactions which are senior or pari passu to the debt due them 
additionally  the lenders also require consent for equity transactions 
the company received the lenders consent in conjunction with the equity financing in november and the hd smith debt financing in april the comerica bank line of credit agreement includes certain financial covenants 
these covenants are specific to arcadia services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which is the legal entity that operates the company s services segment 
as of march   the financial covenants are as follows tangible effective net worth of million as of june  and gradually increasing on a quarterly basis to million by september  minimum quarterly net income of  and  minimum subordination of indebtedness of arcadia resources  inc of million 
in the event of default of any one of the financial covenants  the bank may declare all outstanding indebtedness due and payable  and the bank shall not be obligated to make any further advances to arcadia services  inc if this were to occur  the company would need to obtain alternative financing  if possible  and the terms of this alternative financing would presumably be less attractive than those of the current line of credit agreement 
arcadia services  inc was not in compliance with the minimum quarterly net income covenant for the fiscal fourth quarter ending march  due to the goodwill impairment expense recognized during the quarter 
in june  the company entered into an amendment whereby the bank waived the event of default 
based on the company s projections for the fiscal year ending march   management does not anticipate that arcadia services  inc will violate its financial covenants during the fiscal year 
these projections include various assumptions about future performance of the services segment  and actual results may differ materially from these projections 
additionally  arcadia services  inc ability to meet its minimum subordination of indebtedness covenant could be impacted by the parent company s available cash necessary to fund the early stage pharmacy operations 
the h 
d smith line of credit agreement includes certain financial covenants specific to prairiestone pharmacy  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which is the legal entity that operates the company s pharmacy segment 
specifically  the financial covenants are as follows positive quarterly earnings before income tax  depreciation  and amortization ebitda and current assets divided by current liabilities of greater than 
these financial covenants do not take affect until the fiscal quarter ending march  the company s ability to meet these financial covenants in the future will depend on the pharmacy segment s ability to improve its financial performance over the next seven fiscal quarters

the company has a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
the company s payer mix for the year ended march  was as follows medicare medicaid other government commercial insurance institution facilities private pay off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march   the company had contractual obligations  in the form of non cancelable debt and lease agreements  as follows in thousands payments due by period more less than than total year years years years operating leases    capital leases long term obligations   lines of credit   interest    total     balance represents the amount due to comerica bank at march  under its working capital line of credit agreement 
this balance fluctuates on a daily balance depending on working capital needs 
future interest amounts for variable interest obligations are based on the interest rate in effect as of march  the debt agreements with jana master fund  ltd  vicis capital master fund  and lsp partners  lp provide for the company to elect to either pay the quarterly interest in cash or to add the amount to the principal balance 
the future payment schedule assumes that these amounts are paid in cash 
the aggregate amounts due to these three lenders in the above schedule are less than year  and to years recent accounting pronouncements on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap  superseding existing accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  and the emerging issues task force eitf 
the codification eliminates the previous us gaap hierarchy and establishes one level of authoritative gaap 
all other literature is considered non authoritative 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the company adopted the codification during its fiscal second quarter there was no impact to the consolidated financial results as this change is disclosure only in nature 
in april  the fasb issued additional requirements regarding interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments which were previously only disclosed on an annual basis 
entities are now required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments which are not recorded at fair value in the financial statements in both their interim and annual financial statements 
the new requirements were effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  on a prospective basis 
the company adopted these requirements in the fiscal first quarter the recorded amounts of the company s financial instruments at march  approximate fair value 
on april   the company adopted the revised fasb guidance regarding business combinations which was required to be applied to business combinations on a prospective basis 
the revised guidance requires that the acquisition method of accounting be applied to a broader set of business combinations  amends the definition of a business combination  provides a definition of a business  requires an acquirer to recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition date and requires the assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date with limited exceptions 
there was no impact upon adoption and the effects of this guidance will depend on the nature and significance of business combinations occurring after the effective date 
in june  the fasb ratified consensus which addresses how an entity should evaluate whether an instrument is indexed to its own stock 
the consensus is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  and must be applied to outstanding instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the consensus is adopted and should be treated as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
early adoption was not permitted 
as of april   the adoption of this consensus did not have an impact on the company s financial statement as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  as described in note  the company issued warrants in november which have been accounted for under this guidance 
see note for a discussion on the impact that the adoption of this guidance had on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our cash balances and cash equivalents are held primarily in highly liquid commercial bank accounts 
the company utilizes a line of credit to fund operational cash needs 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our cash equivalents and our borrowings 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
all revenues since inception have been in the us and in us dollars  therefore  management has not yet adopted a strategy for foreign currency rate exposure as it is not anticipated that foreign revenues are likely to occur in the near future
