net revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or  as a result of global economic weakness affecting all electronic markets beginning in the third quarter of lower levels of inventory carried by our distribution partners also contributed to reduced shipments levels compared to prior periods 
all of our business units were impacted by reduced demand in the year ended december   compared to december   with our rf and automotive business unit impacted the most declining year over year and our microcontroller business impacted the least declining just year over year 
gross margin declined to for the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  gross margin for was negatively impacted by lower factory utilization at our wafer fabrication facilities and test operations during the first half of our internal operations have significant fixed costs that cannot be reduced as quickly as our shipment levels  which have declined over the last months 
in addition  gross margins have been unfavorably impacted by inventory write downs and competitive pricing pressures during the year ended december  as order levels have increased significantly in the second half of  we began increasing production levels and factory loading 
we expect gross margin levels to improve in from increased factory loading  as well as a more favorable mix of higher margin microcontroller products included in our net revenues 
we develop process technologies to ensure our products provide the maximum possible performance 
in the year ended december   we manufactured approximately of our products in our own wafer fabrication facilities 
we continue to take significant actions to improve operational efficiencies and further reduce costs 
in the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  in restructuring charges related to headcount reductions and facility closure costs primarily related to our manufacturing operations 
during the year  these various restructuring activities resulted in headcount totals reduced to  employees as of december  from  as of december  benefit from income taxes totaled million in the year ended december   compared to a provision for income taxes of million in the year ended december  the tax benefit recorded for the year ended december  is primarily related to the recognition of foreign research and development r d credits as well as reduced taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions during in the three months ended december   we recorded out of period adjustments totaling million to record income tax expense associated with certain foreign intercompany loans and alternative minimum tax  which related to fiscal years to in addition  during the three months ended june   we recorded an out of period adjustment of million to correct alternative minimum tax liabilities that were overstated in the net impact of out of period adjustments related to prior years totaled million for the year ended december  we have assessed the impact of correcting these errors in the current period and do not believe that these amounts are material to any prior period financial statements  nor is the correction of these errors material to the financial statements 
as a result  we have not restated any prior period amounts 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  our total debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to debt repayments 
our current liabilities decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to debt repayment of million and a decrease in accrued and other liabilities of million 
as a result of lower production levels during  inventory levels decreased significantly 
inventory totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the decline of million year over year was also due  in part  to million of fab work in process inventory reclassified to assets held for sale as of december  on march   we acquired quantum research group ltd 
quantum for an initial purchase price of million  subsequently increased to million due to contingent consideration earned 
the results of operations of quantum are included in our microcontroller segment from the date of acquisition 
in the first quarter of  we announced our intention to pursue strategic alternatives for our asic business and related manufacturing assets as part of our transformation plan  which is aimed at focusing on our high growth and high margin businesses 
in december  we announced that we had entered into an exclusivity agreement with lfoundry gmbh for the potential sale of our rousset  france manufacturing operations 
in january  we announced that following a comprehensive review of alternatives for our asic business  we would continue to explore the potential sale of our smart card sms business located in rousset  france and east kilbride  uk and that we intended to discontinue potential sale discussions for our customer specific products csp and aerospace businesses 
as a result of this agreement  we have reclassified the assets and liabilities related to the manufacturing operations to held for sale as of december  in connection with the proposed sale of the manufacturing operations  we assessed the fair value of the real property and the equipment to be retained and concluded the fair value of the real property was lower than its carrying value  therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of results of continuing operations years ended december  december  december  in thousands  except percentage of net revenues net revenues gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative acquisition related charges charges for grant repayments restructuring charges asset impairment charges recovery gain on sale of assets loss income from operations net revenues net revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or  as a result of global economic weakness affecting all electronic markets beginning in the third quarter of lower levels of inventory carried by our distribution partners also contributed to reduced shipments levels compared to prior periods 
all of our business units were impacted by reduced demand in the year ended december   compared to december   with our rfa business unit impacted most declining year over year and our microcontroller business impacted the least declining just year over year 

table of contents net revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  as global economic weakness translated to customers pushing out or cancelling orders as a result of their own reduced demand 
the decrease in net revenues in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease of million in our rf and automotive segment net revenues primarily as a result of reduced shipments for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for code division multiple access cdma phones of million 
asic segment net revenues decreased million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in our custom asic products of million 
non volatile memory segment net revenue decreased million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to reduced demand and lower pricing for serial eeprom and serial flash products 
in addition  our net revenues decreased by an estimated million due to the conversion of certain european distributors to a sell through revenue model 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in microcontroller segment net revenues of million primarily due to increases in avr net revenues of million  or  and our expanding bit microcontroller business of million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  average exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency net revenues in euro were approximately and euro to the dollar in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net revenues 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported net revenues for the year ended december  would have been higher by million or

table of contents microcontroller microcontroller segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in net revenues was primarily related to reduced demand from customers in asia as we experienced lower shipments for avr products to the handset and consumer markets 
revenue for quantum related products  following the acquisition of quantum in  is included within the microcontroller operating segment 
microcontroller segment net revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to new customer designs utilizing our proprietary avr microcontroller products  our new qtouch touchscreen products  and our arm based microcontroller products 
avr microcontroller revenue grew million or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  arm based microcontroller products revenue increased million or in the year ended december  from the year ended december  net revenues for microcontroller products increased due to gains in the bit microcontroller market and arm based microcontrollers  growth in the overall microcontroller market including recent high volume customer applications in the consumer and industrial markets  and improved delivery times resulting from higher inventory levels 
our bit microcontroller business also grew in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overall demand for microcontrollers was driven by increased use of embedded control systems in consumer  industrial and automotive products 
nonvolatile memory nonvolatile memory segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in net revenues was primarily related to reduced demand from customers in asia for serial eeprom and serial flash memory products as well as further price erosion in certain competitive commodity segments 
pricing trends in this segment have generally been steady during the second half of nonvolatile memory segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction of serial eeprom and serial flash product sales due to reduced demand and increased pricing pressure 
market for our nonvolatile memory products are historically more competitive than other markets we sell in  and as a result  our memory products are subject to greater average declines in selling prices than products in our other segments 
rf and automotive rf and automotive segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in net revenues was primarily related to the significant decline in automotive markets  with european automotive markets representing the largest market we support 
in addition  net revenues for decreased million when compared to as a result of exiting the cdma and other heilbronn based foundry businesses in the year ended december  other rf and automotive revenues decreased million in the year ended december  as a result of lower demand and increased pricing pressures  primarily in gps and dvd customer end markets 
rf and automotive segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to reduced shipment quantities for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for cdma phones and other automotive products 
net revenues for bicmos foundry products decreased million or and other automotive products decreased million or in the year ended december  from the year ended december  the remainder of the decrease came from our cdma foundry business which we exited during the year ended december  
table of contents asic asic segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  asic segment net revenues decreased primarily due to reduced smart card shipments to european telecom and consumer markets of million  offset in part by higher shipments to banking and pay tv end markets 
we also experienced reduced demand in our csp and apg product families  resulting in a decrease of revenue of million in  compared to  from reduced demand for semi custom and crypto memory products 
asic segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of lower net revenues for crypto memory products of million  or  a decrease of custom asic products of million  or  and a decrease in smart card products of million  or 
these decreases were offset by an increase in our aerospace products of million  or 
the decline in smart card products was primarily due to reduced shipments of lower margin commodity telecommunication products

our net revenues in asia decreased million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  and decreased million or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the region was primarily due to lower shipments of memory and microcontroller products as a result of the overall economic slowdown  as well as reduced demand resulting from lower oem and distribution inventory levels 
the decrease in the year ended december  from the year ended december  for the region was primarily due to reduced shipment for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for cdma phones of million 
this decrease was offset in part by increased shipments of avr microcontrollers  as well as higher unit volumes for serial flash and serial eeprom products 
our net revenues in europe decreased million  or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  and decreased million or less than in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the region was primarily due to reduced shipments to smartcard telecom and consumer markets as well as lower demand and increased pricing pressures in gps  dvd and automotive markets 
the decrease in the year ended december  from the year ended december  for the region was primarily due to lower volume shipments of smart card and automotive products 
our net revenues in the united states decreased by million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  and increased million  or in the year ended december  
table of contents  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in the year ended december  from the year ended december  for the region was primarily a result of the overall global economic slowdown  as well as reduced shipments to microcontroller customers 
while net revenues in asia declined year over year  we expect that asia net revenues will grow more rapidly than other regions in the future 
net revenues in asia may be impacted in the future as we refine our distribution strategy and optimize our distributor base in this region 
it may take time for us to identify financially viable distributors and help them develop high quality support services 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to manage this optimization process in an efficient and timely manner 
effective july   we entered into revised agreements with certain european distributors that allow additional rights  including future price concessions at the time of resale  price protection  and the right to return products upon termination of the distribution agreement 
as a result of uncertainties over finalization of pricing for shipments to these distributors  revenues and related costs are deferred until the products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
we consider that the sale prices are not fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to these distributors 
during  net revenues were impacted by million as a result of this change 
revenues and costs impact from changes to foreign exchange rates changes in foreign exchange rates have had a significant impact on our net revenues and operating costs

average annual exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenues and expenses in euro were approximately  and euro to the dollar in the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating costs and loss from operations compared to the prior year 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher  while our operating expenses would also have been approximately million higher relating to cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million  and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
as our foreign currency expenses exceed foreign currency revenues  the net effect  had foreign currency rates remained the same during the year  would have resulted in an increase to loss from operations of approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million lower  while our operating expenses would have also been approximately million lower cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million  and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
as our foreign currency expenses exceed foreign currency revenues  the net effect  had foreign currency rates remained the same during the year  would have resulted in a decrease to loss from operations of approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
table of contents cost of revenues and gross margin gross margin declined to in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  gross margin in the year ended december  was negatively impacted by higher manufacturing costs resulting primarily from reduced factory utilization at our wafer fabrication facilities and test operations compared to utilization levels experienced during the prior year 
our internal operations have significant fixed costs that cannot be reduced as quickly as our shipment levels  which have declined over the last months 
in addition  gross margins have been unfavorably impacted by inventory write downs and competitive pricing pressures during the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we began to increase production levels and factory loading in response to increased demand and expect that gross margin will improve in compared to the levels experienced during gross margin improvements in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to our strategic restructuring initiatives which included the closure of our north tyneside  uk fab  process and cost improvements in our rousset fab and a stronger mix of higher margin microcontroller and other core products 
manufacturing utilization improvements result primarily from higher production levels at our colorado springs  united states and rousset  france fabrication facilities following the closure of our north tyneside  uk facility in the second quarter of our gross margin for the year ended december  was also favorably impacted by a million pension benefit adjustment  which decreased cost of revenues  related to the reduction of pension liability and the release of the related accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale of our manufacturing operations in heilbronn  germany  which was completed in december we receive economic assistance grants in some locations as an incentive to achieve certain hiring and investment goals related to manufacturing operations  the benefit for which is recognized as an offset to related costs 
we recognized a reduction to cost of revenues for such grants of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we develop our own manufacturing process technologies to ensure our products provide the maximum possible performance 
in the year ended december   we manufactured approximately of our products in our own wafer fabrication facilities 
our cost of revenues includes the costs of wafer fabrication  assembly and test operations  changes in inventory reserves  royalty expense and freight costs 
our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues fluctuates depending on product mix  manufacturing yields  utilization of manufacturing capacity  and average selling prices  among other factors 
research and development research and development r d expenses decreased by  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   we continued to reduce spending on non core product development programs and focus development spending on core high growth opportunity projects  with increasing emphasis on microcontroller and touchscreen related products 
we have also reduced spending on proprietary process development  as we expect to utilize more industry standard processes in future periods 
r d expenses in the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  primarily due to decreases in salaries and benefits of million related to reduced headcount  deprecation expenses of million and outside services of million  offset in part by a decrease in grant proceeds of million

we issued performance based restricted stock units to eligible employees for a maximum of million shares of our common stock under the stock plan 
these restricted stock units vest only if we achieve certain quarterly operating margin performance criteria over the performance period of july  to december  we recognize the stock based compensation expense for our performance based restricted stock units when we believe it is probable that we will achieve the performance criteria 
if achieved  the award vests over a specified remaining performance period 
if the performance goals are not met  no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed 
the expected cost of each award is reflected over the performance period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we recorded a credit of million in the three months ended march  related to the reversal of previously recorded stock based compensation expense  based on management s estimate that the probability of achieving the performance criteria was highly uncertain at that time 
however  in the fourth quarter of  after significant improvement to operating results and customer order rates  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  as we re assessed the probability of achieving the performance criteria and estimated that it is probable a portion of the performance criteria will be achieved by december  charges for grant repayments in the years ended december   and  we recorded additional accrued interest of million  million and million  respectively  primarily related to interest on estimated grant repayment requirements for our former greece facility  as charges for grant repayments on the consolidated statements of operations 
we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments targeted at increasing employment at specific locations 
the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits 
noncompliance with the conditions of the grants could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
in addition  we may need to record charges to reverse grant benefits recorded in prior periods as a result of changes to our plans for headcount  project spending  or capital investment at any of these specific locations

asset impairment charges recovery and gain on sale of assets we assess the recoverability of long lived assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
we measure the amount of impairment of such long lived assets by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  which is generally determined based on projected discounted future cash flows or appraised values 
we classify long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until they are disposed  including assets not available for immediate sale in their present condition 
we report assets to be disposed of by sale as held for sale and recognize those assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated

as a result of this agreement  we determined that certain assets and liabilities were no longer included in the disposal group as they were not being acquired or assumed by the buyer  and as result  we reclassified these assets and liabilities back to held and used as of december  in january  we announced that following a comprehensive review of alternatives for our asic business  we would continue to explore the potential sale of our smart card sms business located in rousset  france and east kilbride  uk and that we intended to discontinue potential sale discussions for our customer specific products csp and aerospace businesses 
the assets and liabilities that remain in the disposal group are classified as held for sale are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at december   at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
in determining any potential write down of these assets and liabilities  we considered both the net book value of the disposal group  which was million and also a credit balance of million related to foreign currency translation adjustments cta balance that are recorded within stockholders equity 
as a result  no impairment charge was recorded for the disposal group as its carrying value  net of the cta balance  cannot be reduced to below zero 
the cta balance remaining in stockholders equity at the date of sale will be released to the statement of operations at that date 
if we are successful in selling our french manufacturing operations  we intend to enter into a multiyear supply agreement with the buyer  on similar terms to previous fabrication facility sales 
this supply agreement  and other transition agreements  may result in significant charge to us  either upon sale or to future periods

as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of no impairment charge was recorded for the equipment that was reclassified to held and used but the depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the asset disposal group been continuously classified as held and used  which totaled of million was included in operating results in fourth quarter of the proposed sale of the manufacturing operations in rousset  france  is not expected to qualify as discontinued operations as we expect to have continuing cash flows associated with supply agreements with the buyer in future periods 
heilbronn  germany we announced our intention to sell our fabrication facility in heilbronn  germany in december subsequently  we decided to sell only the manufacturing operations related to the fabrication facility 
in the three months ended september   we entered into an agreement to sell the manufacturing operations to tejas silicon holding limited tsi 
we recorded an impairment loss of million in the year ended december   which consisted of million for the net book value of the fixed assets and million for selling costs related to legal  commissions and other direct incremental costs 
we recorded a gain on sale of million in the year ended december  upon closing of the sale 
the sale of the heilbronn manufacturing operations did not qualify as discontinued operations as the operations and future cash flows were not eliminated from our rf and automotive segment 
we continue to purchase wafers from the buyer of the heilbronn fabrication facility 
see note north tyneside  united kingdom on october   we entered into definitive agreements to sell certain wafer fabrication equipment and land and buildings at north tyneside to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and highbridge business park limited highbridge for a total of approximately million 
we recorded proceeds of million and recognized a gain of million for the sale of the equipment in the year ended december  we received proceeds of million from highbridge upon closing of the real property portion of the transaction in november we vacated the facility in may acquisition related charges we recorded total acquisition related charges of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the acquisition of quantum  which comprised of the following components we recorded amortization of intangible assets of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  associated with customer relationships  developed technology  trade name  non compete agreements and backlog 
these assets are amortized over three to five years 
we estimate charges related to amortization of intangible assets will be approximately million for the year ending december  in the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with acquired in process research and development ipr d  in connection with the acquisition of quantum 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price to ipr d involves established valuation techniques utilized in the high technology industry 
we also agreed to compensate former key executives of quantum  contingent upon continuing employment determined at various dates over a three year period 
we have agreed to pay up to million in cash and issue  shares of our common stock valued at million  based on our closing stock price on march  these amounts are being accrued over the employment period on a graded vested basis

the charges relating to this initiative consist of the following net charges of million  related to severance costs resulting from involuntary termination of employees 
employee severance costs were recorded in accordance with the accounting standard related to costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
charges of million related to facility closure costs 
we paid million related to employee termination costs in the year ended december  restructuring charges in the year ended december   we incurred restructuring charges of million as we continued to implement additional restructuring actions to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs 
we incurred restructuring charges related to the signing of definitive agreements in october to sell certain wafer fabrication equipment and real property at north tyneside to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc and highbridge business park limited highbridge 
as a result of this action  this facility was closed and all of the employees of the facility were terminated by june  in addition  we began implementing new initiatives  primarily focused on lowering manufacturing costs and eliminating non core research and development programs 
we recorded the following restructuring charges credits net charges of million related to severance costs resulting from involuntary termination of employees 
charges of million related to equipment removal and facility closure costs 
after production activity ceased  we utilized employees as well as outside services to disconnect fabrication equipment  fulfill equipment performance testing requirements of the buyer  and perform facility decontamination and other facility closure related activity  included in these costs are labor costs  facility related costs  outside service provider costs  and legal and other fees 
equipment removal  building decontamination and closure related cost activities were completed as of june  charges of million related to contract termination charges  primarily associated with a long term gas supply contract for nitrogen gas utilized in semiconductor manufacturing 
we are required to pay an early termination penalty including de contamination and removal costs 
other contract termination costs related to semiconductor equipment support services with minimum payment clauses extending beyond the current period 
net charges of million related to changes in estimates of termination benefits originally recorded 
we paid million related to employee termination costs in the year ended december  
table of contents restructuring activities during  we implemented restructuring initiatives announced in and in we recorded a net restructuring charge of million  which included restructuring charges related to the sale of certain wafer fabrication equipment and real property at north tyneside to tsmc and highbridge 
as a result of these actions  this facility was closed and all of the employees of the facility were terminated 
related to this sale  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded the following restructuring charges charges of million related to one time severance costs for involuntary termination of employees 
charges of million related to on going severance costs for involuntary termination of employees 
charges of million related to other exit related costs 
in addition  we also incurred the following restructuring charges in charges of million related to severance costs for involuntary termination of employees 
charges of million related to one time minimum statutory termination benefits  including changes in estimates 
a credit of million related to the settlement of a long term gas supply contract for which the accrual was million  originally recorded in the third quarter of on may   in connection with the sale of the irving  texas facility  we paid million to terminate this contract  of which million was reimbursed by the buyer of the facility 
we paid million related to employee termination costs in the year ended december  interest and other expense income  net interest and other expense income  net  was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  the increases in net expenses were primarily a result of a decrease in interest income of million on our investment portfolio and an increase in foreign exchange losses of million  offset by a decrease in interest expense of million due to lower debt balance 
interest and other expense income  net  was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  the net expenses in the year ended december  resulted primarily from an increase in interest expense related to our million outstanding bank line of credit which was outstanding for all of  compared to less than one month in the year ended december  the net expense in the year ended december  was also a result of a reduction of interest income of million in the year ended december  due to lower interest rates and an increase in foreign exchange transaction losses of million 
interest rates on our outstanding borrowings did not change significantly in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  benefit from provision for income taxes we recorded a benefit from provision for income taxes of million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant component of these amounts in the years ended december   and  was a benefit of million  million and million  respectively  due to the recognition of refundable r d credits that related to prior years 
the refundability of these credits does not depend on the existence of taxable income or a tax liability and the credits were not previously recognized due to uncertainty over the realization of these credits 
the credits were realized during these years as the income tax audits were completed or the related statutes of limitation for the credits expired 
in the year ended december   the tax benefit was partially offset by net out of period adjustments related to prior years of million discussed below 
the income tax provision in the years ended december  and resulted primarily from taxes incurred by the company s profitable foreign subsidiaries and an increase in tax reserves related to certain us federal  state and foreign tax liabilities  partially offset by the recognition of tax credits in foreign jurisdictions and the refund of unused tax credits 

table of contents in the three months ended december   we recorded out of period adjustments totaling million to record income tax expense associated with certain foreign intercompany loans and alternative minimum tax  which related to fiscal years to in addition  during the three months ended june   we recorded an out of period adjustment of million to correct alternative minimum tax liabilities that were overstated in the net impact of out of period adjustments related to prior years totaled million for the year ended december  we have assessed the impact of correcting these errors in the current period and do not believe that these amounts are material to any prior period financial statements  nor is the correction of these errors material to the financial statements 
as a result  we have not restated any prior period amounts 
in the year ended december   we reviewed the potential us tax impact of intercompany loans among foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of this review  the december  deferred tax asset balances were adjusted to reflect the utilization of federal net operating losses from prior years  and the addition of foreign tax credit carryovers from prior years 
these changes in the net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards were offset by a corresponding change to the valuation allowance 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at december   there was no us income tax provision for undistributed earnings of approximately million  respectively  as it is currently our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us the determination of the tax effect of repatriating these earnings is not practicable because of the numerous assumptions associated with this hypothetical calculation 
however  foreign tax credits would be available to reduce some portion of this amount 
at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards in non us jurisdictions of approximately million 
these loss carry forwards expire in different periods starting in we also had us state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million at december  these loss carry forwards expire in different periods from through we also have us federal r d credits of million and state r d tax credits of million at december  us federal r d credits will begin to expire beginning in  and the state r d credits carryforward indefinitely 
we have foreign tax credits of million which start to expire in and state investment tax credits of million at december  that begin to expire in in addition  we have foreign r d credits of million which are refundable in the future if they are not used to offset future tax liability 
on january   we adopted the accounting standard related to uncertain income tax positions 
under the accounting standard  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
at december   and  we had million  million and million of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
in  the internal revenue service irs completed its audit of our us income tax returns for the years and and has proposed various adjustments to these income tax returns  including carry back adjustments to and in january  after subsequent discussions with us  the irs revised their proposed adjustments for these years 
in may  the irs completed its audit of our us income tax returns for the years and and has proposed various adjustments to these income tax returns 
we have protested all of these proposed adjustments and are currently working through the matters with the irs appeals division 
in  the french tax authority completed its examination of tax years through for one of our french subsidiaries 
the examination for these years has resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryover of million  for which there was a full valuation allowance 
the income tax return for the tax year is currently under limited scope audit by the french tax authority 
in addition  we have tax audits in progress in us states and other foreign jurisdictions 
we have accrued taxes and related interest and penalties that may be due upon the ultimate resolution of these examinations 
while we believe that the resolution of these tax credits will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  the outcome is subject to significant uncertainties 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  our current ratio  calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  improved to at december   compared to at december  we reduced our short term and long term debt obligations to million at december  from million at december  working capital  calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately million of our investment portfolio at december  was invested in auction rate securities  compared to million at december  in the year ended december  approximately million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value 
approximately million and million of our auction rate securities are classified as long term investments within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and  as they are not expected to be liquidated within the next twelve months 
in october  we accepted an offer from ubs financial services inc ubs to purchase our remaining eligible auction rate securities of million at par value at any time during a two year time period from june  to july  we expect to sell the securities to ubs at par value on june   therefore  these securities are classified within short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  was primarily due to positive operating results  adjusting the year to date net loss of million to exclude asset impairment charge of million  certain non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million and stock based compensation charges of million 
in addition  operating cash flows were increased by reduced inventories relating to lower production levels of million 
cash flows from operations were reduced by million in payments reducing liabilities incurred in prior year  including restructuring payments of million and a repayment of customer advance of million  along with cash outflow of million that increased current and other assets  including prepayments for insurance  product licenses and taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  cash flows from operations in were driven by strong operating results  adjusting the year to date net loss of million to exclude depreciation and stock based compensation of million  offset by accounts payable and accrued liability cash outflows that included restructuring and grant repayment expenditures incurred in the course of closing our north tyneside  uk manufacturing facility of approximately million 
accounts receivable increased by or million to million at december   from million at december  the average days of accounts receivable outstanding dso increased to days at december  from days at december  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily impacted by shipment linearity  payment terms offered  our customers credit worthiness  and collection performance 
should we need to offer longer payment terms in the future due to competitive pressures or longer customer payment patterns  our dso and cash flows from operating activities would be negatively affected 
decreases in inventories provided million of operating cash flows in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  our days of inventory decreased to days at december  from days at december   primarily due to significantly reduced manufacturing activity levels and increased shipment levels experienced during the fourth quarter of the year 
inventories consist of raw wafers  purchased specialty wafers  work in process and finished units 
we are continuing to take measures to reduce manufacturing cycle times and improve production planning efficiency 
however  the strategic need to offer competitive lead times may result in an increase in inventory levels in the future 

table of contents in the year ended december   we made cash payments of million to former quantum employees in connection with contingent employment arrangements resulting from the acquisition  which was completed during the first quarter of investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   we paid million for acquisitions of fixed assets and million for intangible assets and approximately million related to contingent consideration earned by a former quantum employee 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million for the acquisition of quantum  net of cash acquired  and million for capital expenditures  offset in part by million we received from the sale of fabrication equipment from our north tyneside  uk facility 
we anticipate expenditures for capital purchases will be between million and million in  which will be used to maintain existing manufacturing operations and provide additional testing capacity 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  we continued to pay down debt  with repayments of principal balances on our bank lines of credit and capital leases totaling million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  equipment lease financing  and other short term and medium term bank borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements over the next twelve months 
during the next twelve months  we expect our operations to generate positive cash flow 
however  a significant portion of cash may be used to repay debt  make capital investments or satisfy restructuring commitments 
we expect that we will have sufficient cash from operations and financing sources to satisfy all debt obligations 
we made million in cash payments for capital equipment in the year ended december   and we expect our cash payments for capital expenditures to be between million to million in debt obligations outstanding at december   which are classified as short term  totaled million 
we paid million in restructuring payments  primarily for employee severance in the year ended december  we expect to pay out approximately million in further restructuring payments during during and future years  our capacity to make necessary capital investments will depend on our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and on our ability to obtain adequate financing if necessary 
in the event that we cannot obtain adequate financing due to credit market conditions or must pay down our million in a line of credit  we believe we have sufficient funds due to the million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we held as of december  together with expected future cash flows from operations  which amounted to million for the year ended december  on march   we entered into a five year asset backed credit facility for up to million with certain european lenders 
this facility is secured by our non us trade receivables 
at december   the amount outstanding under this facility was million 
in june  we repaid million under this line of credit as its eligible non us trade receivables declined 
the eligible non us trade receivables were million at december  borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor plus per annum approximately based on the one month libor at december   while the undrawn portion is subject to a commitment fee of per annum 
the outstanding balance is subject to repayment in full on the last day of its interest period every two months 
the terms of the facility subject us to certain financial and other covenants and cross default provisions 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants as of december  on november   we reduced the credit facility to million from million 
commitment fees and amortization of up front fees paid related to the facility in the years ended december   and totaled million each year and are included in interest and other expense income  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents in december  we established a million revolving line of credit with a domestic bank  which was extended until september the interest rate on the revolving line of credit was either the lower of the domestic bank s prime rate or libor plus 
the revolving line of credit was secured by our us trade receivables and requires us to meet certain financial ratios and to comply with other covenants on a periodic basis 
in february  we repaid million and the remaining million was repaid on september   when the revolving line of credit matured 
contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total in thousands notes payable capital leases lines of credit total debt obligations capital purchase commitments long term supply agreement obligation a long term supply agreement obligation b estimated pension plan benefit payments see note grants to be repaid restructuring e operating leases acquisition related payable c other long term obligations d total other commitments add interest total a this amount relates to the contractual obligation on a supply agreement that we entered into with the buyer of our manufacturing operations in heilbronn  germany facility 
the wafers are purchased at cost in euros  which represents the fair value at the time of purchase 
the commitment is equivalent to approximately million euros 
b this amount relates to long term gas supply agreements that we have entered into with various suppliers 
c we have an obligation to pay certain former quantum employees million in cash see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
d other long term obligations consist principally of future repayments of approximately million of advances from customers  and million of technology license payments 
long term advances from customers include approximately million that is due within year  and has been classified within current liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the balance is due in annual installments of million per year  until repaid in full 
the remaining balance is primarily related to various other long term obligations 
e contains all restructuring liabilities as of december  
table of contents the contractual obligation table excludes liabilities of million because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
approximately million of our total debt requires us to meet certain financial ratios and to comply with other covenants on a periodic basis  and have cross default provisions 
the financial ratio covenants include  but are not limited to  the maintenance of minimum cash balances and net worth  and debt to capitalization ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  if we need to renegotiate any of these covenants in the future  and the lenders refuse and we are unable to comply with the covenants  then we may immediately be required to repay the loans concerned 
in the event we are required to repay these loans ahead of their due dates  we believe that we have the resources to make such repayments  but such payments could adversely impact our liquidity 
our ability to service long term debt in the us or to obtain cash for other needs from our foreign subsidiaries may be structurally impeded 
since a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries  our cash flow and ability to service debt are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to the us parent corporation 
these foreign subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may have limited or no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amount to us  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
however  the us parent corporation owes much of our consolidated long term debt 
defined benefit pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all french and german employees 
plan benefits are provided in accordance with local statutory requirements 
benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels 
the plans are non funded 
pension liabilities and charges to expense are based upon various assumptions  updated quarterly  including discount rates  future salary increases  employee turnover  and mortality rates 
retirement plans consist of two types of plans 
the first plan type provides for termination benefits paid to employees only at retirement  and consists of approximately one to five months of salary 
this structure covers our french employees 
the second plan type provides for defined benefit payouts for the remaining employee s post retirement life  and covers our german employees 
pension benefits payable totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash funding for benefits to be paid for is expected to be approximately million  and an additional million thereafter over the next years 
off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies  which we review to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities 
we have evaluated our investments in these privately held companies and have determined that there was no material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
certain events can require a reassessment of our investments in privately held companies to determine if they are variable interest entities and which of the stakeholders will be the primary beneficiary 
as a result of such events  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities 
we may be unable to influence these events 
during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either our subsidiaries or us 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantee agreements is approximately million 
we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
we have updated our disclosures to conform to the codification in this form k for the year ended december  in june  the fasb also issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
the elimination of the concept of a qspe  removes the exception from applying the consolidation guidance within this amendment 
this amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a vie 
the amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a vie 
additionally  the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with vies and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement  as well as how its involvement with vies impacts the enterprise s financial statements 
finally  an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a vie 
this amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this amendment on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued an amendment and clarification to address application issues regarding initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
the amendment is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  although we did not enter into any business combinations during  we believe the amendment may have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements depending on the size and nature of any future business combinations that we may enter into 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we sell our products to oems and distributors and recognize revenue when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
allowances for sales returns and other credits are recorded at the time of sale 
contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales terms do not include post shipment obligations except for product warranty  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents for sales to certain distributors primarily based in the us and europe with agreements allowing for price protection and product returns  we recognize revenue at the time the distributor sells the product to its end customer 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to price protection rights  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
at the time of shipment to these distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on the consolidated balance sheets 
this balance represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin recognized by us in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 
we do not reduce deferred margin by estimated price protection  instead  such price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
deferred income on shipments to distributors was million and million at december  and  respectively 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors primarily based in asia carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors upon shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of sale 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenues may result 
we provide for sales returns based on our customer experience and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing specific customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
in the three months ended december   we recorded a bad debt charge of million related to an asian distributor whose business was impacted following their addition to the us department of commerce entity list  which prohibits us from shipping products to the distributor 
accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  it is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

table of contents our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
our tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis for raw materials and purchased parts and an average cost basis for work in progress and finished goods or market 
cost includes labor  including stock based compensation costs  materials  depreciation and other overhead costs  as well as factors for estimated production yields and scrap 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize selling prices in our period ending backlog for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value provision is charged to cost of revenues at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are provided for 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence 
increases to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenues 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  the related provision is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
our inventories include high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
fixed assets we review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrated continuing losses associated with an asset  iv significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value  v recent changes in our manufacturing model  and vi management s assessment of future manufacturing capacity requirements 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions  which require our judgment  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  we must use our judgment in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our fixed assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is put into use for production 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which 
table of contents depreciation was not being recorded was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  which are formed by evaluating operating plans 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments 
the assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation our determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant utilizes an option pricing model  and is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors during the expected period between the stock option vesting date and the stock option exercise date 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
for performance based restricted stock units  we are required to assess the probability of achieving certain financial objectives at the end of each reporting period 
based on the assessment of this probability  which require judgment  we record stock based compensation expense  which may be reversed in future periods if we determine that it is no longer probable that the objectives will be achieved 
the fair value of a restricted stock unit is equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the measurement date 
restructuring charges we have recorded accruals for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring accruals include primarily payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases  other contracts and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
accruals are recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
litigation the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we accrue for losses related to litigation if a loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether accruals for litigation should be made 
if we were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities include corporate debt securities  us government and municipal agency debt securities  commercial paper  guaranteed variable annuities and auction rate securities 
we monitor our investments for impairment periodically and recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of these investments is judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 
our investments also include certain highly rated auction rate securities  which are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of either or days and contractual maturities that can be in excess of ten years 
we evaluate our portfolio by continuing to monitor the credit rating and interest yields of these auction rate securities and successful reset at each auction date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities whose values are dependent upon short term interest rates 
we generally classify these securities as available for sale  and consequently record them on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded as a separate part of stockholders equity 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
given our current profile of interest rate exposures and the maturities of our investment holdings  we believe that an unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on our investment portfolio or statements of operations through december  in addition  certain of our borrowings are at floating rates  so this would act as a natural hedge 
we have short term debt  long term debt and capital leases totaling million at december  approximately million of these borrowings have fixed interest rates 
we have approximately million of floating interest rate debt  of which approximately million is euro denominated 
we do not hedge against the risk of interest rate changes for our floating rate debt and could be negatively affected should these rates increase significantly 
while there can be no assurance that these rates will remain at current levels  we believe that any rate increase will not cause a significant adverse impact to our results of operations  cash flows or to our financial position

table of contents the following table presents the hypothetical changes in interest expense  for the year ended december  related to our outstanding borrowings that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the modeling technique used measures the change in interest expense arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in yield  of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps 
for the year ended december  interest expense given an interest interest expense interest expense given an interest rate decrease by x basis points with no change in rate increase by x basis points bps bps bps interest rate bps bps bps in thousands interest expense foreign currency risk when we take an order denominated in a foreign currency we will receive fewer dollars than we initially anticipated if that local currency weakens against the dollar before we ship our product  which will reduce revenue 
conversely  revenues will be positively impacted if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
in europe  where our significant operations have costs denominated in european currencies  costs will decrease if the local currency weakens 
conversely  costs will increase if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
the net effect of average exchange rates in the year ended december   compared to the average exchange rates in the year ended december   resulted in a decrease in loss from operations of million in this impact is determined assuming that all foreign currency denominated transactions that occurred in the year ended december  were recorded using the average foreign currency exchange rates in the same period in approximately  and of our net revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies 
operating costs denominated in foreign currencies  were approximately  and of total operating costs in the years ended december   and  respectively 
average annual exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenues and expenses in euro were approximately  and euro to the dollar in the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating costs and loss from operations 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher 
however  our foreign currency expenses exceed foreign currency revenues 
had average exchange rates for the year ended december  remained the same as the average exchange rates for the year ended december   our operating expenses would have been approximately million higher relating to cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million  and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect resulted in a decrease to loss from operations of approximately million in the year ended december  as a result of favorable exchange rates when compared to the year ended december  we may take actions in the future to reduce this exposure 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce the exposure to additional unfavorable changes to exchanges rates and the results on gross margin 
we also face the risk that our accounts receivables denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts receivables were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
we also face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and valuation risk approximately million of our investment portfolio at december  was invested in auction rate securities  compared to million at december  in the year ended december  approximately million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value 
approximately million and million of our auction rate securities are classified as long term investments within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and  as they are not expected to be liquidated within the next twelve months 
in october  we accepted an offer from ubs financial services inc ubs to purchase our remaining eligible auction rate securities of million at par value at any time during a two year time period from june  to july  we expect to sell the securities to ubs at par value on june   therefore  we have classified these securities to short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet as of december
