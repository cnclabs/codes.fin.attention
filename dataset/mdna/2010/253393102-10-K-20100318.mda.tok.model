effective february   the company amended its e commerce agreement and began recording e commerce revenue on a gross basis as the principal party in the transactions compared to its prior recording of these revenues on a net basis pursuant to fasb asc  overall considerations of reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the primary factors which historically influenced the company s profitability and success have been its growth in the number of stores and selling square footage  positive comparable store sales and its strong gross profit margins 
in the last five years  the company has grown from stores as of the end of fiscal to stores as of the end of fiscal  reflecting both organic growth and acquisitions 
the company continues to expand its presence through the opening of new stores  although its rate of growth has decreased from the rate of growth experienced in earlier years  reflecting recent economic conditions 

table of contents fiscal  like fiscal  continued to be a difficult operating environment for our industry due to numerous external factors weighing on specialty retail sales 
the pressures on the consumer have remained intact as unemployment has risen  equity markets have declined in recent years and concerns about the broader economy have grown 
these factors  combined with continuing weak housing markets and tight credit markets  suggest continued pressure on specialty retail consumers in the near term 
the company continues to see the greatest sales weakness in bigger ticket  discretionary purchases such as golf and exercise equipment  while the lodge business has benefited from higher gun and ammunition sales 
however  since the balance of macroeconomic factors that impact the company s business remains unfavorable  the company will continue to take a cautious approach to ensure that it is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as they develop 
as a result  the company has implemented numerous strategies to help it manage through these uncertain times  including remaining focused on expense management  strategic deployment of capital and managing inventories in line with sales trends 
the company reduced its fiscal capital expenditures to million compared to million in fiscal  net of proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and allowances received from landlords

the company believes that its comparable stores sales performance was affected by numerous challenges  including a difficult macroeconomic environment and declining consumer confidence  resulting in lower average unit retail prices due to particularly cautious spending 
although the company believes it has made noticeable progress in improving its merchandise offerings  the effect of those improvements have been hampered by the macroeconomic environment 
the company s current strategy is to target a general overall trend to return to positive comparable store sales growth  although we recognize that we continue to be affected by many of these macroeconomic factors 
the company believes that its ability to realize such a general overall positive trend in comparable store sales will prove to be a key factor in achieving its targeted levels of earnings per share and continuing its store expansion program to an ultimate goal of at least locations across the united states 
positive operating cash flow the company generated million of cash flow from operations in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the company believes that a key strength of its business has been the ability to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations 
strong cash flow generation is critical to the future success of the company  not only to support the general operating needs of the company  but also to fund capital expenditures related to new store openings  relocations  expansions and remodels  costs associated with its store support center and its distribution centers  costs associated with continued improvement of information technology tools and costs associated with potential strategic acquisitions that may arise from time to time

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventory using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market price is generally based on the current selling price of the merchandise 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
historically  the company has rarely experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes  such as customer merchandise preference  unseasonable weather patterns  economic conditions or business trends could cause the company s inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends 
the company performs physical inventories at the stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for shrink represents an estimate for shrink for each of the company s locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results 
vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances  rebates and cooperative advertising funds received from vendors 
these funds are determined for each fiscal year and the majority are based on various quantitative contract terms 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of merchandise inventories are treated as a reduction of inventory and reduce cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
the company records an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest projected purchase volumes and advertising forecasts 
on an annual basis at the end of the year  the company confirms earned allowances with vendors to ensure the amounts are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract 
business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
the determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions which we believe provides a reasonable basis for determining fair value 
accordingly  we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventory  identifiable intangible assets such as trade names  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill  indefinite lived and other finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company deems it necessary 
our evaluation for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
if these judgments or estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test is a two step impairment test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow and a market value approach 
the company s estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business models  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect the company s future financial results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the activities in the second step include valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit s goodwill based upon the residual of the summed identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite lives are also not subject to amortization and are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment  or more frequently as mentioned above 
the fair value of the company s intangible assets are estimated and compared to their carrying value 
the company estimates the fair value of these intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
this approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future growth and trends  royalty rates in the category of intellectual property  discount rates and other variables 
the company recognizes an impairment charge when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
impairment of long lived assets and closed store reserves the company reviews long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is the store level 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by the company with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
based on an analysis of current and future store performance  management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores 
reserves are established when the company ceases to use the location for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income 
if the timing or amount of actual sublease income differs from estimated amounts  this could result in an increase or decrease in the related reserves 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  industry factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents uncertain tax positions we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  whereby the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s net exposure to interest rate risk consists primarily of borrowings under the credit agreement 
the company s credit agreement bears interest at rates that are benchmarked either to us short term floating rate interest rates or one month libor rates  at the company s election 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of january  and january  the impact on the company s annual net income of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on the average outstanding balances under the credit agreement would be approximately million based upon fiscal average borrowings 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
tax matters presently  the company does not believe that there are any tax matters that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of the company s net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year  which is due in part to the holiday selling season and in part to sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in fiscal fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year
