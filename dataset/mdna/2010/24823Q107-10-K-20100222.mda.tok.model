year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts consolidated statement of operations data revenue operating expenses loss from operations interest income expense loss gain from valuation of warrant liability net loss basic and diluted net loss per share shares used in computation of basic and diluted net loss per share as of december  consolidated balance sheet data cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments working capital total assets warrant liability long term obligations  less current portion total stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics that significantly improve cancer treatment options for patients 
our portfolio includes active immunotherapy  monoclonal antibody and small molecule product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge sipuleucel t  an active cellular immunotherapy for prostate cancer 
we will not generate revenue from the sale of our potential commercial therapeutic products in the us until provenge or another product candidate we may develop is approved for marketing by the us food and drug administration the fda 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from our available cash resources and future offerings of equity  debt or other securities 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million  of which million relates to the value of our warrant liability described below 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing expenses and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and research efforts 
we anticipate incurring net losses over the next two years regardless of whether provenge is approved for marketing as we expand our operations including our manufacturing capabilities  develop the infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge  continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals and invest in research and product development 
we cannot predict when we may achieve profitability in the future  if ever  or our ability to sustain such profitability if achieved 
the majority of our resources continue to be used in support of provenge 
we own worldwide rights for provenge 
since receiving positive clinical data from our impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study for provenge in april  we have focused on the amendment to our biologics license application our bla  submitted in october  and expanding our manufacturing operations 
the fda has confirmed that our amendment constituted a complete response to the complete response letter  received on may   and the goal date for fda action on our bla under the prescription drug users fee act is may  we have and expect to continue to significantly increase our investment in commercial infrastructure in preparation for the possible fda licensure of provenge 
we began the expansion of our manufacturing facility in morris plains  new jersey the new jersey facility in july to bring that facility to full capacity 
we expect the additional build out of that facility to be substantially completed later this year  which will be followed by validation and an inspection by the fda 
we expect the additional capacity to be available in the first half of during july and august  we entered into new facilities leases in atlanta  georgia  and orange county  california  for an aggregate of approximately  square feet of space we intend to use for commercial manufacturing  following construction build out and validation of these new facilities 
each of these facilities leases has an initial ten and a half year term  with two renewal terms of five years each 
in atlanta  georgia  the shell of the building is under construction and we have commenced the build out of the facility 
in orange county  california  we are in the midst of the construction build out consisting of cell processing stations  quality control laboratories  a data center  training areas  infrastructure and offices 
we anticipate it will take approximately one year from commencement of construction to substantially complete the build out of these facilities  which will be followed by validation and inspection by the fda prior to use for the commercial manufacture of provenge 
other potential product candidates we have under development include lapuleucel t  our investigational active cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with bladder  breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her neu 
active cellular immunotherapies directed at ca  an antigen highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma and cea  an antigen expressed in colorectal cancer  are in preclinical development 
we are also developing an orally available small molecule targeting trpm that could be applicable to multiple types of cancer as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia 
in december we filed an investigational new drug application ind to investigate this small molecule in advanced cancer patients 
the ind was cleared by the fda in january in  we commenced our phase i clinical trial to evaluate trpm and the trial is ongoing 
critical accounting policies and estimates we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates  that could have reasonably been used  would have materially changed our consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity at purchase of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the amounts are recorded at cost  which approximates fair value 
our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments consist principally of commercial paper  money market securities  corporate bonds notes and certificates of deposit 
we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the amortized cost of investments is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in interest income 
interest earned on securities is included in interest income 
gains are recognized when realized in our consolidated statements of operations 
losses are recognized when realized and when we have determined that an other than temporary decline in fair value has occurred 
we periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their cost are other than temporary 
this evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs 
additionally  we assess whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we consider an investment with a maturity greater than twelve months as long term and a maturity less than twelve months as short term at the balance sheet date 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
revenue recognition substantially all of the revenue we have recorded to date is related to collaborative research revenue and license revenue 
we recognize collaborative research revenues from up front payments  milestone payments  and personnel supported research funding 
we also recognize license revenue from intellectual property and technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are generally contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
license fees license fees from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which we have continuing obligations  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  an estimate is made of the time required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
the basis of the revenue recognition is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectability is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
royalty income royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products  and revenues are calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses prior to january   research and development costs were expensed as incurred including nonrefundable prepayments for research and development services 
on january   we adopted accounting standards codification asc  research and development research and development arrangements  and changed our accounting policy 
for new contracts entered into as of or subsequent to january   nonrefundable prepayments for research and development services are deferred and recognized as the services are rendered 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  facilities and related overhead costs 
warrant liability on april   we issued million shares the shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase up to million shares of common stock the warrants to an institutional investor the investor 
the investor purchased the shares and warrants for a negotiated price of per share of common stock purchased 
the warrants are exercisable at any time prior to april   with an exercise price of per share of common stock and include a net exercise feature 
the warrants have been recorded at their relative fair values at issuance and will continue to be recorded at fair value each subsequent balance sheet date 
any change in value between reporting periods will be recorded as other income expense each reporting date 
the warrants will continue to be reported as a liability until such time as they are exercised or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions that require this treatment  at which time the warrants will be adjusted to fair value and reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity 
the fair value of the warrants is estimated using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
as of december  and  the fair value of the warrants was determined to be million and million  respectively  accordingly  we recorded approximately million and  in loss gain from valuation of warrant liability for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of the warrants 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value 
the fair value of our stock options are calculated by the bsm option pricing model 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we grant restricted stock awards that generally vest over a four year period  however  in  we granted restricted stock awards with certain performance conditions to all employees 
we are required to estimate the probability of achieving each acceleration provision 
compensation expense is recorded based upon our assessment of accomplishing each accelerated provision 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock based payment awards on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the entire award  unless the awards are subject to other conditions  in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche 
we also determine the fair value of awards under our employee stock purchase plan using the bsm option pricing model 
for additional information about stock based compensation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures except as it applies to the non financial assets and non financial liabilities subject to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures transition and open effective date information  which we adopted effective january  the impact of these items was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
assets and liabilities typically recorded at fair value on a non recurring basis include long lived assets measured at fair value due to an impairment assessment under asc  property  plant and equipment  and asset retirement obligations initially measured under asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures transition and open effective date information asc  which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased 
it also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly and emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability  and regardless of the valuation techniques used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted asc  investments debt and equity securities other presentation matters transition and open effective date information asc that amends the impairment guidance for certain debt securities and requires an investor to assess the likelihood of selling the security prior to recovering its cost basis 
if an investor is able to meet the criteria to assert that it will not have to sell the security before recovery  impairment charges related to those credit losses would be recognized in earnings  while impairment charges related to non credit losses would be reflected in other comprehensive income 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
on january   we adopted asc  collaborative arrangements asc  which requires a certain presentation of transactions with third parties and of payments between parties to a collaborative arrangement in our statement of operations  along with disclosure about the nature and purpose of the arrangement 
the adoption of asc did not have any impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
on january   we adopted asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity scope and scope exceptions asc  which requires that we apply a two step approach in evaluating whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to our own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
the adoption of asc did not have any impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted asc  subsequent events asc that establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of asc did not have any impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
during the quarter ended september   the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued asc  generally accepted accounting principles asc that mandated that the fasb accounting standards codification the codification become the single official source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap other than guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission the sec  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  emerging issues task force eitf  and related literature 
the adoption of asc did not have any substantive impact on our condensed financial statements or related footnotes 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue revenue was  in   in and  in the decrease in compared to is attributable to lower royalty revenue 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased revenue related to the sale of certain intellectual property in our revenue in and also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to one license agreement 
revenue in includes recognition of  in revenue related to an intellectual property option purchase agreement entered into in with wilex ag 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to is the result of increased wages  payroll taxes and employee related expenses including stock compensation as well as product development costs in connection with our product candidate provenge 
the decrease compared with was primarily due to decreased phase clinical activities as a result of the completion of patient enrollment in the impact trial in late  the completion of the initial build out and subsequent utilization of our morris plains  new jersey manufacturing facility the new jersey facility and resultant reduction of outside clinical manufacturing  the purchase of antigen in  the reduction in the costs for pre commercialization efforts of provenge and the decrease in headcount and related severance costs associated with the reduction in force 
financial data related to our research and development activities is categorized as either costs associated with clinical programs or discovery research 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions clinical programs direct costs indirect costs total clinical programs discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical program include wages  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses  rent  restructuring charges  stock based compensation  utilities and other facilities related maintenance 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our product development programs are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for commercialization by the necessary regulatory agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were primarily comprised of salaries and wages  consulting fees  marketing fees and administrative costs to support our operations 
the increase in compared with was primarily attributable to increased payroll and outside costs related to pre commercialization efforts for provenge 
the decrease in compared with was primarily attributable to decreased outside services and marketing costs related to pre commercialization efforts for provenge  decreased headcount and severance costs associated with the reduction in force and decreased legal fees associated with our current legal proceedings 
interest income interest income was  in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to was due to lower average interest rates 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash and investment balances 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to was the result of lower average debt balances and greater capitalized interest related to the construction of our manufacturing facilities and our product tracking and scheduling system 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance in  including the principal amount of the convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes as compared to  offset by greater capitalized interest related to the construction of the new jersey facility and our product scheduling system and by decreased interest expense related to debt and capital lease obligations 
warrant liability non operating loss gain associated with the change in value of our warrant liability was million and  in and  respectively 
the fair value of the warrant liability was calculated using the bsm option pricing model and is remeasured at each reporting period 
potential future increases in our stock price will likely result in losses being recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
conversely  potential future declines in our stock price will result in gains being recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
neither of these potential gains or losses will have any impact on our cash balance  liquidity or cash flows from operations 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards r d credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the nols and r d credits expire at various dates  beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the nols and r d credits may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of nols and r d credits before utilization 
stock based compensation expense total stock based employee compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  were included in research and development expense and million  million and million  respectively  were included in general and administrative expense 
total stock based employee compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in  and increased our net loss per share by  and  respectively 
as we apply a full valuation allowance to our deferred taxes  there was no impact on deferred taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash uses and proceeds as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity  debt and convertible securities  cash receipts from collaborative agreements  and interest income earned 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in all periods were a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for was also impacted by an increase in cash expenditures as we prepare for the prospective commercial launch of provenge in since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment increased to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively  as facilities related expenditures  including equipment purchases  increased in as we prepare for the prospective commercial launch of provenge in net cash provided by financing activities increased in compared to and primarly as the result of common stock issuances in may and december we received net proceeds of million and million from the common stock issuances in may and december  respectively  after deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we believe that our current cash on hand as of december   is sufficient to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months as we initiate our commercialization efforts in anticipation of possible licensure of provenge 
if we receive licensure of provenge  we expect revenue from product sales could be a significant source of cash 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to meet potential additional long term liquidity needs for uses including the development of marketing  manufacturing  information technology and other infrastructure and activities related to the commercialization of provenge  working capital needs  increased personnel needs  and continuing and expanding our internal research and development programs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy  which specifies credit quality standards  limits our credit exposure to any single issuer and defines allowable investments 
auction rate or asset backed securities without a guarantee by the us government are not permitted to be purchased 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively and long term investments of million and million  respectively 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short term and long term investments at december   assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by million  which would not materially impact our operations 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
we proactively monitor and manage our portfolio 
if necessary we believe we are able to liquidate our investments within the next year without significant loss 
we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government and major corporate guarantees of the underlying securities  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded values 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan
