overview we are a provider of innovative medical devices used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures to treat peripheral vascular disease  or pvd  and local oncology therapy options for treating cancer  including radiofrequency ablation rf or rfa systems and embolization products for treating benign and malignant tumors 
in addition  we provide our nanoknife system for the ablation of soft tissue 
we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad line of therapeutic and diagnostic devices that enable interventional physicians interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons  interventional and surgical oncologists and others to treat pvd  tumors  and other non coronary diseases 
prior to fiscal  we reported our results of operations as a single segment 
at the beginning of fiscal  we organized our business into three reportable segments peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
the peripheral vascular segment is comprised of our venous  angiographic  pta  drainage and thrombolytic product lines 
the access segment is comprised of our dialysis  port and picc product lines 
the oncology surgery segment is comprised of our rfa  embolization  habib and nanoknife product lines 
prior periods have been recast for net sales and gross profit for this new reporting structure 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 
the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollars in thousands peripheral vascular access oncology surgery total we sell our broad line of quality devices in the united states through a direct sales force and outside the us through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships 
as of may   our sales organization numbered in the us and outside the us for fiscal years  and  net sales in non u 
s markets were  and  respectively 
the increase in our net sales outside the us from to is primarily as a result of the diomed acquisition completed in june our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
we recognize the importance of  and intend to continue to make investments in  research and development 
for fiscal  and  our research and development r d expenditures were million  million and million  respectively  and constituted  and  respectively  of net sales 
r d activities include research  product development  intellectual property  and regulatory and 
table of contents clinical affairs 
r d expenditures related to the nanoknife system projects totaled million in and million in  or and of net sales  respectively 
we expect that our r d expenditures will be approximately of net sales in fiscal primarily due to investment in nanoknife technology and remain in the range of to of net sales thereafter 
however  downturns in our business could cause us to reduce our r d spending 
we are also seeking to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in january  we acquired rita medical systems  inc this acquisition created a diversified medical technology company with a broad line of access  diagnostic and therapeutic products that enable interventional physicians and surgeons to treat peripheral vascular disease and cancerous tumors 
interventional oncology is a large and growing area for our existing customer base and rita s leadership position  premium products and excellent reputation fit our strategy 
rita had a very strong position in vascular access ports  which are an ideal sales fit with our morpheus ct picc 
in addition  in may we acquired ablation technology which uses low energy direct current ledc electrical pulses which will be complementary to rita s diverse offering of local oncology therapies  including its market leading rfa systems  habib sealer tm resection devices and lc beads tm for tumor embolization 
we are in the process of commercializing the ledc technology and recently introduced the nanoknife generator 
in june  we completed the acquisition of certain us and us assets of diomed  inc with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of diomed endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
in january  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of flowmedica  inc providing us with the benephit product line  a therapeutic approach to deliver drugs directly to the kidneys in order to prevent and treat acute kidney injury  in the emerging field of targeted renal therapy 
except to the extent we can further use our equity securities as acquisition capital  we will require additional equity or debt financing to fund any future significant acquisitions 
for fiscal  approximately of our product sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  as compared with for fiscal and for fiscal we intend to manufacture more products in house to lower product costs and increase profitability 
in and  we expanded our manufacturing facility in queensbury  new york  to provide us with additional manufacturing capacity and to accommodate additional research  development and administrative requirements 
in july  we entered into an agreement to lease a  square foot office building in latham  new york to house our corporate headquarters and certain business operations 
we commenced occupancy of the facility in march our ability to increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or to decline 
recent developments distribution agreement amendment we sell the embolization product  lc bead  pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with biocompatibles uk limited that grants us exclusive distribution rights to the product in the united states 
the agreement was entered into in and has been amended four times  most recently in march to extend distribution rights until december  ceo transition on january   we entered into an employment agreement and non statutory stock option agreement with our then chief executive officer that provided  among other things  for a transition to a new chief executive officer 
the transition to the new chief executive was completed in the third quarter of fiscal the 
table of contents former chief executive officer did not have an operating role after february  accordingly  we recorded a provision in fiscal of approximately million in general and administrative expenses for all current and future costs associated with the aforementioned employment agreement and non statutory stock option agreement and certain costs associated with the recruitment of a new chief executive officer 
the new ceo commenced employment with us in march acquisition of flowmedica  inc on january   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of flowmedica  inc for approximately million in cash and a contingent payment based on fiscal sales of flowmedica products 
with this acquisition  we purchased the benephit product line  a therapeutic approach to deliver drugs directly to the kidneys in order to prevent and treat acute kidney injury  in the emerging field of targeted renal therapy 
intangible assets acquired totaled approximately million which have been identified as product technologies year weighted average useful life 
inventory acquired totaled approximately  the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  we have included the results of operations in the financial statements effective january  the pro forma effects of the acquisition were not material to our income statement and balance sheet 
ten employees of flowmedica  inc became employees upon completion of the acquisition 
acquisition of certain assets of diomed on june   we completed the acquisition of certain us assets of diomed  inc and uk assets of diomed uk limited  in separate transactions  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash including capitalized acquisition costs 
with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of diomed endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
the total of the net tangible assets acquired was million 
goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions was approximately million 
intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  totaled approximately million of which million has been identified as customer relationships year estimated weighted average useful life and  has been identified as product technologies year estimated weighted average useful life 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  we have included the results of operations in the financial statements effective june  the pro forma effects of the diomed acquisition on our income statement and balance sheet were not material 
thirty five employees of diomed became employees of ours upon completion of the acquisition 
company reorganization prior to fiscal  we reported our results of operations as a single segment 
at the beginning of fiscal  we organized our business into three reportable segments peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
the peripheral vascular segment is comprised of our venous  angiographic  pta  drainage and thrombolytic product lines 
the access segment is comprised of our dialysis  port and picc product lines 
the oncology surgery segment is comprised of our rfa  embolization  habib and nanoknife product lines 
prior periods have been recast for net sales and gross profit for this new reporting structure 
acquisition of oncobionic  inc on may   we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of oncobionic  inc pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement entered into on october  the closing of the acquisition came as a result of the successful use of low energy direct current ablation technology in the first human clinical trial for the treatment of soft tissue in april 
table of contents under the october stock purchase agreement  we agreed to pay a total purchase price of million  including  of assumed liabilities 
we made payments of million upon the execution of the stock purchase agreement in october  million on may  upon the closing of the acquisition  million in november and million in november the stock purchase agreement also provides for future royalty payments due on net sales of any catheter based products sold by us that incorporate low energy direct current to achieve tissue ablation by inducing irreversible electroporation 
we hold a license to such technology under a license agreement with the regents of the university of california the uc license 
we have accounted for the acquisition of oncobionic as a purchase under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities of oncobionic were recorded as of the acquisition date  at their respective fair values  and consolidated with those of angiodynamics 
substantially all of the purchase price was recorded as product technology and is being amortized over a year useful life 
we have recorded goodwill and a deferred tax liability of million 
in future periods the deferred tax liability will be reduced to offset the tax impact of non deductible amortization expense on the intangible assets acquired 
acquisition of rita medical systems  inc on january   we completed the acquisition of rita for a total purchase price of approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash  million shares of common stock  and assumption of outstanding rita options and other convertible securities  which were exercisable for an additional million shares of our common stock at the time of acquisition 
rita s operating results were consolidated with those of angiodynamics beginning on the date of the acquisition  january  since our results are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of rita  fluctuations in our operating results for as compared to the and period are significantly impacted by the acquisition of rita 
we acquired rita for its market position  premium product offerings  developed and emerging technologies in the fields of interventional oncology and vascular access and its highly skilled workforce 
the merger was pursued and completed because the management groups and stockholders of angiodynamics and rita believed the combined entity would achieve higher sales and profitability than either or both of the pre merger companies on a standalone basis 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s authoritative guidance on revenue recognition which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectibility are based upon our judgments  as discussed under accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion 
table of contents is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue  net of sales taxes assessed by any governmental authority  as products are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title and risk of loss passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and customers may be subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
we have chosen to early adopt  effective with the third quarter of fiscal  updated authoritative guidance for revenue recognition relating to the accounting treatment for revenue arrangements that involve more than one deliverable or unit of accounting 
at the same time  we also adopted the updated guidance relating to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
neither of these had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible 
for fiscal years  and  our write offs of accounts receivable have been insignificant 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of operations 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of may   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately million and million  respectively 
the deferred tax asset includes million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards remaining from the rita acquisition 
these losses could be significantly limited under internal revenue code irc section our analysis of rita s ownership changes as defined in irc section shows that approximately million of remaining federal net operating losses and million of remaining state net operating losses will expire prior to utilization 
the gross deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses reflects this limitation 
we need to generate approximately million of taxable income in each year over the next sixteen years to ensure the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we have determined that we have sufficient existing levels of pre tax earnings to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheets 
in order to support the realizability of our net deferred tax asset  we projected our pre tax income utilizing a combination of historical and projected results 
utilizing this projected pre tax income  we have projected taxable income taking into consideration existing levels of permanent differences including stock option exercise deductions and non deductible expenses and the reversal of significant temporary differences 

table of contents our federal net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering irc section limitations are million 
the expiration of the federal net operating loss carryforwards are as follows million in  million between and and million between and our state net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering remaining irc section limitations are million which expire in various years from to in july  fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this guidance seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this guidance requires us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we adopted this guidance on june  there was no cumulative effect of the adopting the guidance 
upon adoption  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was zero 
during the twelve months ended may   we did not recognize any tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our global operations as a component of income tax expense 
this accounting policy did not change as a result of the adoption the guidance on tax uncertainties mentioned above 
accrued interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated balance sheet were as of may  and may  we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and in february which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
fiscal years through remain open to examination by the various tax authorities 
we analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income taxes  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and we do not anticipate any adjustments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost at standard cost which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
as of may   may  and may   our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was   and  respectively 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the 
table of contents period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may result in an impairment and or significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range between three and nineteen years  on either a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
beginning in fiscal we began reporting three operating segments as opposed to a single segment in prior periods 
our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments and include peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
as a result  the carrying value of goodwill was allocated to each of the reporting units on a relative fair value basis 
we completed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit as of december  our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill in each of the reporting units was not impaired 
the fair value of peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery exceeded its carrying value by  and  respectively 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based upon our stock price plus an estimated control premium of approximately as of december  for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
to determine fair value  we utilized two market based approaches and an income approach 
under the market based approaches  we utilized information regarding our own as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples 
under the income approach  we determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
we determined the discounted cash flow as the best indicator to determine fair value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations  we assumed that the current economic conditions would continue through fiscal year  followed by a recovery thereafter 
in addition  we applied gross margin assumptions consistent with our historical trends at various revenue levels and used an ebitda exit multiple of  and to calculate the terminal value of the peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery reporting units  respectively  compared to an ebitda exit multiple of  and  respectively  used in the prior year 
in addition  we used a discount rate of  and to calculate the fair value of our peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery reporting units  respectively 
these discount rates vary from the rates of  and  respectively  used in the prior year 

table of contents we test goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment exists 
even though we determined that there was no goodwill impairment as of december   the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions  loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  would require an interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units prior to the next required annual assessment as of december  it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
events that could  in the future  result in impairment include  but are not limited to  sharply declining sales for a significant product or in a significant geographic region 
since early november  our stock market capitalization has generally been lower than our shareholders equity or book value 
however  our reporting units have continued to generate significant cash flow from their operations  and we expect that they will continue to do so in and beyond 
furthermore  given the relatively small difference between our stock price and our book value per share  we believe that a reasonable potential buyer would offer a control premium for our business that would adequately cover the difference between our trading prices and our book value 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
for  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax  or per diluted share 
for  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax  or per diluted share and was million pre tax million after tax  or per diluted share in under the provisions of the guidance adopted  we expect to recognize the following future expense for awards granted prior to may  unrecognized compensation cost weighted average remaining vesting period in years stock options non vested stock awards unrecognized compensation cost for stock options is presented net of assumed annual forfeitures 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will vest annually  and we have therefore applied a annual forfeiture rate in determining the stock based 
table of contents compensation charge recorded 
we will re evaluate this estimate periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate on a prospective basis as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that actually vest 
for the fiscal years ended may   may  and may   we used the black scholes option pricing model black scholes as our method of valuation and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of the grant as determined by the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  and a risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
prior to fiscal  due to our limited public history  we considered historical volatility and trends within our industry peer group when estimating expected stock price volatility 
beginning with fiscal  we began to utilize our historical volatility when estimating expected stock price volatility 
we use yield rates on us treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the expected term is determined using the simplified method due to our limited public history 
the dividend yield is based on the history and expectation of dividend payments 
we have not paid dividends in the past nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
our historical data includes information from may   the date of our initial public offering 
results of operations our operating results for fiscal  and are expressed as a percentage of total net sales in the following table

the reclassifications resulted in an increase in marketing costs and a decrease in general and administrative costs of in fiscal 
table of contents in july  we entered into an agreement to lease  for a ten year period plus five year renewal options  a  square foot office building in latham  new york to house our corporate headquarters and certain business operations 
we commenced occupancy of the facility in march the lease provides for annual rent of  for the first five years and  for the next five years  plus the payment of customary building operating expenses 
the lease commencement date was march  on january   we entered into an employment agreement and non statutory stock option agreement with our then chief executive officer that provided  among other things  for a transition to a new chief executive officer 
the transition was completed in the third quarter of fiscal and the former chief executive officer has not had an operating role with us since february  accordingly  we recorded a provision in fiscal of approximately million in our general and administrative expenses for all current and future costs associated with the aforementioned employment agreement and non statutory stock option agreement and certain costs associated with the recruitment of our new chief executive officer 
the accrued liability for the ceo transition on the balance sheet was million at may  and on may  the results also include approximately  for the write off of architectural  design and planning costs associated with a project to build an office facility in queensbury  new york 
the project was cancelled upon the decision to lease office space in latham  new york 
the results include a million provision for the settlement of the vnus litigation million net of tax  a gain of million million net of tax on the settlement of the diomed litigation  and post judgment interest expense on the diomed judgment recorded in fiscal our results include a litigation charge of million million  net of tax  for the judgment awarded diomed and pre judgment interest  in general and administrative expenses  and  for post verdict interest expense 
for  and  we were able to use net operating losses nols accumulated by rita to offset the amount of cash we paid for federal and state income taxes 
the cash benefit amounted to approximately million  million and million for the years ended may   may  and may   respectively 
under purchase accounting rules  we are unable to use acquired nols to offset our provision for income taxes in the statements of operations 
fiscal years ended may  and may  net sales 
net sales are derived from the sale of our products and related freight charges  less discounts and returns 
net sales for fiscal increased by  or million  to million from million in fiscal the growth in net sales was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of lc beads  venacure evlt procedure kits  nanoknife generators and probes  benephit renal infusion products and rf electrodes  partially offset by a decrease in unit sales of infusion sets 
from a segment perspective  peripheral vascular sales increased to million from million 
this increase was driven primarily by increased sales of venacure evlt procedure kits and benephit renal infusion products 
access sales were million  a slight increase from million primarily attributable to increased unit sales of dialysis  picc and port products partially offset by decreased unit sales of infusion sets and a decline in average selling prices of access products 
oncology surgery sales were million  an increase of over the prior year results of million primarily due to increased unit sales of our lc beads  nanoknife generators and probes and rf electrodes 
nanoknife sales totaled million in fiscal from a geographical perspective  us sales increased million or in fiscal to million from million a year ago 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased unit sales of lc beads  venacure evlt procedure kits  benephit renal infusion products and nanoknife generators partially offset by a decrease in unit sales of infusion sets 
international sales were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal increased unit sales of rf electrodes  rf generators and other rf devices comprised the majority of this increase 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold  which includes the costs of materials  products purchased from third parties and sold by us  manufacturing personnel  royalties  freight  business insurance  depreciation of property and equipment and other manufacturing overhead 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower average selling prices for access and peripheral vascular products and higher material costs for certain access products partially offset by higher average selling prices for oncology surgery products 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses include costs to develop new products  enhance existing products  validate new and enhanced products  manage clinical and regulatory affairs and our intellectual property 
r d expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the cost of development of new access products and increased spending on clinical activities 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses were for fiscal  compared with for the prior year period 
million was spent on nanoknife r d activities in fiscal at may   we employed people in r d activities compared with people at the end of fiscal sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing s m expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel and related business expenses  attendance at medical society meetings  product promotions and samples 
s m expenses increased million or to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased marketing activities for the venacure evlt and benephit renal infusion products and nanoknife marketing activities 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower spending on marketing programs and trade show activities 
as a percentage of net sales  s m expenses were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal million was spent on nanoknife sales and marketing activities in fiscal at may   we employed people in sales and marketing activities compared with people a year ago 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses includes the cost of executive management  finance  accounting  legal  human resources and information technology and the administrative and professional costs associated with those activities 
g a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal due to inclusion in the prior year period of million of ceo transition costs and the write off of architectural  planning and design costs associated with a cancelled project to build office space in queensbury  new york  partially offset by increased personnel and other infrastructure costs to support our growth 
exclusive of these costs in the prior year  g a expenses decreased to of net sales in fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
this improvement was gained by aggressive cost management 
as of may   we employed people in general and administrative activities compared with people a year ago 
amortization of intangibles

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on investments and financing that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
although we have entered into interest rate swaps with a bank to limit our exposure to interest rate change on our variable interest rate financings  we do not currently engage in any other hedging or market risk management tools 
at may   we maintained variable interest rate financing of million in connection with our facility expansions 
we have limited our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements with a bank under which we agreed to pay the bank fixed annual interest rate payments of and and the bank assumed our variable interest payment obligations under the financing 
nearly all of our sales have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
although not significant  in late fiscal we began to make sales in other currencies  particularly the euro  gb pound and canadian dollar 
approximately of our sales in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and gb pound 
we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange risk and such risk in the future is expected to be modest 
our excess cash is invested in highly liquid  short term  investment grade securities with maturities primarily of less than two years 
these investments are not held for speculative or trading purposes 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
we hold investments in auction rate securities ars in order to generate higher than typical money market investments 
ars typically are high credit quality  generally achieved with municipal bond insurance 
credit risks are eased by the historical track record of bond insurers  which back a majority of this market 
sell orders for any security traded through an auction process could exceed bids 
such instances are usually the result of a drastic deterioration of issuer credit quality 
should there be a failed auction  we may be unable to liquidate our position in the securities in the near term 
we have million in investments in two auction rate securities issued by new york state and local government authorities that have failed auctions 
the authorities are current in their interest payments on the securities 
we are party to legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business as described in note q
