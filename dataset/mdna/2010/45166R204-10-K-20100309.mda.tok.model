item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview idenix is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases with operations in the united states and europe 
currently  our primary research and development focus is on the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
our hcv discovery program is focused on multiple classes of drugs  which include nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors  non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and nsa inhibitors 
our strategic goal is to develop all oral combinations of direct acting antiviral drug candidates that will eliminate the need for interferon and or ribaviron as the current treatment for hcv 
our objective is to develop low dose  once or twice daily agents with broad genotypic activity that have low potential for drug drug interaction and are designed for use in multiple combination regimens 
we will seek to build a combination development strategy  both internally and with partners  to advance the future of hcv treatments 
in addition to our strategy of developing drugs for the treatment of hcv  we have also developed products and drug candidates for the treatment of hepatitis b virus  or hbv  human immunodeficiency virus type  or hiv  and acquired immune deficiency syndrome  or aids 
we successfully developed and received worldwide marketing approval for telbivudine tyzeka sebivo  a drug for the treatment of hbv that we licensed to novartis pharma ag  or novartis 
in  we began receiving royalties from novartis based on a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
we also discovered and developed through proof of concept clinical testing idx  a drug candidate from the class of compounds known as non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  or nnrtis  for the treatment of hiv aids 
we licensed our nnrti compounds  including idx  to glaxosmithkline  or gsk  in february the following table summarizes key information regarding our pipeline of hcv drug candidates as well as tyzeka sebivo and idx

indication product drug candidates programs description hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors idx and idx after a phase i clinical study was completed in october  which demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics and safety properties in healthy volunteers  we initiated a proof of concept clinical trial 
in july  we successfully completed the proof of concept clinical trial of idx in treatment na ve hcv genotype infected patients 
in october  we initiated a day dose ranging phase iia clinical trial evaluating idx in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in treatment na ve hcv genotype infected patients 
this clinical trial is currently ongoing 
we have also initiated three month toxicology studies for idx and plan to complete these studies to support longer duration clinical trials 
we have completed late stage preclinical development of idx

indication product drug candidates programs description non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor idx in september  we submitted a clinical trial application  or cta  for a choline salt form of idx in november  we initiated a single ascending dose phase i clinical study in healthy volunteers  in which idx exhibited favorable safety and pharmacokinetics properties 
in the first quarter of  we submitted a cta for a free acid form of idx the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  as a free acid allows improved manufacturing processes and long term stability of the drug product  providing diverse formulation options 
we plan to continue the phase i program with higher single and multiple doses of the free acid form of idx in healthy volunteers 
protease inhibitor idx we selected idx as our lead clinical candidate from our protease inhibitor discovery program 
we submitted a cta in december and initiated a phase i healthy volunteer clinical study in january nsa inhibitor in  we initiated an nsa discovery program 
we plan to submit an investigational new drug application  or ind  or cta in  assuming positive results from ind enabling preclinical studies 
hbv tyzeka sebivo telbivudine l nucleoside novartis has worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo 
we receive royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
hiv non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor idx in  we successfully completed a proof of concept clinical trial of idx in treatment na ve hiv infected patients 
in february  we granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize idx all of our drug candidates are currently in preclinical or clinical development 
to commercialize any of our drug candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such drug candidates 
we anticipate that we will incur significant additional third party research and development expenses that range from million to million for each drug candidate prior to commercial launch 
our current estimates of additional third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib iv clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure 
table of contents costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our drug candidates on a project by project basis 
set forth below were the third party research and development expenses incurred in connection with our significant preclinical studies and clinical trials

disease indication product drug candidate years ended december  in thousands hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors   hcv non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor   hcv protease inhibitors   hcv valopicitabine  hcv preclinical discovery program  hbv telbivudine tyzeka sebivo  hbv valtorcitabine  hiv non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor novartis has the option to license our development stage drug candidates after demonstration of activity and safety in a proof of concept clinical trial pursuant to our development  license and commercialization agreement with novartis  which we refer to as the development and commercialization agreement 
if novartis licenses any of our drug candidates  novartis is obligated to fund development expenses that we incur in accordance with development plans agreed upon by us and novartis 
in october  novartis waived its option to license idx as a result  we retain the worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  commercialize and license idx we plan to seek a partner who will assist in the further development and commercialization of this drug candidate 
novartis continues to have the right to license other drug candidates from our pipeline  including idx and idx  after a proof of concept clinical trial has been completed 
novartis licensed valopicitabine and valtorcitabine from us under the development and commercialization agreement  however  in  we ceased development of these drug candidates due to overall risk benefit profiles observed in clinical testing 
also in  we transferred to novartis our worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations pertaining to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo 
we do not expect to incur any additional development expenses related to these products or drug candidates 
pursuant to the license agreement we entered into with gsk in february  which we refer to as the gsk license agreement  described more fully below  gsk is solely responsible for the worldwide development  manufacture and commercialization of our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
subject to certain conditions  gsk is also responsible for the prosecution of our patents licensed to gsk under the gsk license agreement 
we do not expect to incur any additional development costs related to our nnrti program  including idx we have incurred significant losses since our inception in may and at december  had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect such losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery and development activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together with expected royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs through at least the next twelve months 

table of contents novartis collaboration in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
in may  novartis also purchased approximately of our common stock 
since this date  novartis has had the ability to exercise control over our strategic direction  research and development activities and other materials business decisions 
we derived substantially all of our total revenues from novartis in  and through the recognition of license fees  milestone payments  development expense reimbursements  product sales of co marketed products and royalty payments 
under the collaboration  novartis paid us a license fee of million in may for our hbv product and drug candidate  telbivudine tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine  respectively  and provided development funding for telbivudine and valtorcitabine 
we also received payments of million for achieving two regulatory milestones in relating to telbivudine 
during and  we recorded product sales related to tyzeka sebivo 
in late  we ceased development of valtorcitabine and we transferred to novartis our worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo in exchange for royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage varies based on the specified territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 
we do not expect to receive any additional milestone payments for telbivudine and valtorcitabine from novartis 
under the development and commercialization agreement  novartis also exercised its option to license valopicitabine for the treatment of hcv and paid us a license fee of million in  a million milestone payment based upon results from our phase i clinical study and provided development funding for this drug candidate 
in  we discontinued the development of valopicitabine and as a result  we do not expect to receive any additional license fees or regulatory milestone payments for valopicitabine from novartis 
we will continue to recognize revenue related to novartis associated with the non refundable payments received and recorded as deferred revenue that are amortized over the development period of our licensed drug candidates 
we also anticipate recognizing additional revenues from our collaboration with novartis  which may include license fees  development expense funding for our drug candidates that novartis may elect to subsequently license from us  as well as  regulatory milestones and  if products are approved for sale  commercialization milestones and revenues derived from sales  by us or novartis  of our licensed drug candidates 
glaxosmithkline collaboration in february  we entered into the gsk license agreement and granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
in february  we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with gsk  which we refer to as the gsk stock purchase agreement  under which gsk purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million  or a per share price of 
these agreements became effective in march in march  we received a million payment from gsk  which consisted of a million license fee payment under the gsk license agreement and million under the gsk stock purchase agreement 
pursuant to the gsk license agreement  we could also potentially receive up to million in milestone payments as well as double digit tiered royalties on worldwide product sales 
the parties have agreed that if gsk  its affiliates or its sublicensees desire to develop idx for an indication other than hiv or if gsk intends to develop any other licensed compound for any indication  the parties will mutually agree on a separate schedule of milestone and royalty payments prior to the start of development

collaboration revenue related party was million in as compared to million in the majority of the increase was due to million in additional license fee revenue recognized  mainly related to the impact of novartis stock subscription rights  as well as million in additional royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo as compared to these amounts were partially offset by a million decrease in the reimbursement of research and development costs from novartis 
in  we also recognized million of license fee revenue under the gsk license agreement  which was classified as other revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
cost of revenues cost of revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily a result of higher royalty payments due to a third party based on net sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million in lower expenses related to the transfer of the development of idx to gsk pursuant to the gsk license agreement  which we entered into in february we also had million in lower salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of employee attrition in the united states and europe as well as the elimination 
table of contents of employee positions associated with the closing of our lab facility in cagliari  italy in june additionally  lab operating costs decreased million and preclinical expenses decreased million due to cost saving initiatives 
we expect our research and development expenses for to be consistent with the amount incurred in although we expect to incur additional expenses related to the initiation of clinical trials for our non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor and protease inhibitor drug candidates in  we plan to seek a partner that will assist in the further development and commercialization of idx we will continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities  expand our research pipeline and engage in future development activities as we continue to advance our drug candidates and explore collaborations with other entities that we believe will create shareholder value 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million in lower consulting fees and million in lower salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of employee attrition in the united states 
additionally  depreciation expense decreased million  which was primarily a result of the recognition of accelerated depreciation in march for assets that were no longer in use 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to be lower than expenses incurred in due to reduced personnel related expenses and ongoing cost saving initiatives 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in as compared to million in in june  we closed our lab facility in cagliari  italy and eliminated employee positions as a result of continuing cost saving initiatives 
the million restructuring charge recognized in consisted of million of employee severance costs and million contract termination costs associated with closing the lab facility 
as of december   million of severance costs and million of contract termination costs were paid and the remaining balance of million continues to be accrued for contract termination costs 
we estimate that this restructuring will result in annual savings of at least million 
in an effort to maximize our resources toward the development of our current clinical drug candidates and our focused hcv research activities  in january  we eliminated employee positions in the united states 
a restructuring charge of approximately million for employee severance costs will be recorded and paid in the first quarter of we estimate that this restructuring will result in annual savings of million 
other income  net other income  net was million in as compared to million in the majority of decrease is due to a lower amount of research and development credits that our french subsidiary is expected to receive as a result of incurring lower expenses in as compared to these refundable research and development credits were reclassified in from income tax benefit to other income  net to correct the classification in our consolidated statements of operations

effective october   as a result of the amendment to the development and commercialization agreement with novartis that we entered into in september  which we refer to as the amendment  collaboration revenue related party was comprised of the following license and other fees received from novartis for the license of hbv and hcv drug candidates  net of reductions for novartis stock subscription rights  which is being recognized over the development period of our licensed drug candidates  royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis  reimbursement by novartis for expenses we incurred in connection with the development and registration of our licensed products and drug candidates  net of certain qualifying costs incurred by novartis  and milestone amounts from novartis upon achievement of regulatory filings  certain marketing authorization approvals and other milestone payments 
prior to october   collaboration revenue related party that we recognized from novartis also included the following product revenue rest of world which is comprised of amounts that novartis would pay us for the supply of licensed products in countries other than the following the united states  united kingdom  germany  france  spain and italy 
these amounts were recorded as revenue at a percentage of net sales  and profit sharing to related party which represents the net benefit amount paid to novartis on licensed product sales in the united states in which we acted as the lead commercialization party 
the net benefit  defined as net sales less cost of goods sold  was shared equally with novartis on product sales in the united states 
these amounts due to novartis were recorded as a reduction of collaboration revenue related party 

table of contents collaboration revenue related party was million in as compared to million in the majority of the decrease was due to million in lower reimbursements of research and development costs from novartis as a result of the transfer to novartis of our development  manufacture rights and obligations of telbivudine in october and the discontinuation of our valtorcitabine and valopicitabine development activities in the third quarter of additionally  no milestone revenue was recognized in as compared to the decrease of million in license fee revenue was primarily due to million in lower revenue recognized in related to a milestone payment received in and million related to the impact of novartis stock subscription rights 
the remainder of the decrease in license fee revenue was a result of adjusting the expected development period of our licensed drug candidates  which represents the period over which we recognized license fee revenue 
the million decrease in product sales  net in was a result of the transfer to novartis of our worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations of telbivudine tyzeka sebivo in october we no longer record product sales revenue related to tyzeka sebivo 
cost of revenues cost of revenues of million in were substantially unchanged as compared to research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to million in lower expenses as a result of the transfer to novartis of our development  manufacture rights and obligations of telbivudine in october and the discontinuation of our valtorcitabine and valopicitabine development activities in the third quarter of in addition  salaries and personnel related costs decreased by million due to the reduction in headcount as part of the october restructuring 
expenses related to idx decreased by million primarily due to lower manufacturing expenses in offsetting these amounts was an increase of million related to the evaluation of compounds from our hcv preclinical discovery program in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to million in lower salaries and personnel related costs due to a reduction in headcount and consultants as part of the october restructuring 
additionally  sales and marketing expenses decreased by million as a result of the transfer to novartis in october of our commercialization rights to tyzeka sebivo

the million of employee severance and benefits were paid in and other income  net other income  net was million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to million of lower interest earned as a result of lower average cash and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  due to the use of cash for operations 
additionally  in  we recognized realized losses of million related to the sale of securities and million in impairment charges related to securities that we classified as available for sale 
offsetting these amounts was an increase of million primarily related to the research and development credits of our french subsidiary 
these refundable research and development credits were reclassified in from income tax benefit to other income  net to correct the classification in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents gain on sale of equity securities in october  we sold the equity securities we held in pharmasset  inc  for net proceeds of million and realized a gain of million on the sale 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations with proceeds obtained in connection with license and development arrangements and equity financings 
the proceeds include license  milestone  royalty and other payments from novartis  license and stock purchase payments from gsk  reimbursements from novartis for costs we have incurred subsequent to may  in connection with the development of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine  sales of tyzeka in the united states through september   net proceeds from sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation for reimbursement of development costs  net proceeds from private placements of our convertible preferred stock  net proceeds from public or underwritten offerings in july  october and august  net proceeds from private placements of our common stock concurrent with our and public offerings  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted pursuant to our equity compensation plans 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together with the expected royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs through at least the next twelve months 
in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  for an indeterminate amount of shares of common stock  up to the aggregate of million  for future issuance 
pursuant to this shelf registration statement  in august  we issued approximately million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million in an underwritten offering 
we may seek additional funding through a combination of public or private financing  collaborative relationships and other arrangements in the future 
in may  we received approval from novartis to issue additional capital shares pursuant to a financing under our existing shelf registration statement so long as the issuance of additional shares did not reduce novartis interest in idenix below 
as of february   novartis owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
any financing requiring the issuance of additional shares of capital stock must first be approved by novartis so long as novartis continues to own at least of our voting stock 
if we do not receive licensing or milestone payments  or additional funding through a public or private financing  we have the ability and intent to reduce expenditures to preserve our cash resources and fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
these actions would include reductions in the number of our employees and delaying or canceling planned expenditures in our research and development programs 
we had total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
as of december   we had million  or of our total cash balance  in cash and cash equivalents and million in non current marketable securities 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in current marketable securities and million in non current marketable securities 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested in government agency and treasury money market instruments and an auction rate security 
our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
the distress in the financial markets over the past two years has caused certain investments to diminish liquidity and decline in value 
due to the failed auctions related to our auction rate security and the continued uncertainty in the credit markets  the market value of our securities may decline further and may 
table of contents prevent us from liquidating our holdings 
to mitigate this risk  beginning in  we began to shift our investments to instruments that carry less exposure to market volatility and liquidity pressures 
as of december   the majority of our investments were in government agency and treasury money market instruments 
we held one auction rate security with an estimated fair value of million as of december  net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities in compared to was due primarily to less expenses related to the transfer of the development of idx to gsk and million received from gsk pursuant to the gsk license agreement 
additionally  we incurred less operating expenses in as compared to due to reduced headcount and cost saving initiatives 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities in compared to was due primarily to less operating expenses in as a result of the transfer of tyzeka sebivo to novartis in october net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in was due primarily to lower net proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities as compared to and this was attributable to lower cash balances invested in marketable securities in due to the use of cash to fund operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to million in net proceeds received from the underwritten offering in august additionally  we received million in proceeds related to the issuance of stock to gsk pursuant to the gsk stock purchase agreement entered into in february the net cash provided by financing activities in and was primarily due to the exercise of stock options by employees

these obligations are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the cash payments will be made 
pursuant to the license agreement between us and the university of alabama at birmingham  or uab  we were granted an exclusive license to the rights that the university of alabama at birmingham research foundation  or uabrf  an affiliate of uab  emory university and the le centre national de la recherche scientifique  or cnrs  have to a us patent application and progeny thereof and counterpart patent applications in europe  canada  japan and australia that cover the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv 
in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with uab  uabrf and emory university relating to our telbivudine technology 
pursuant to this settlement agreement  all contractual disputes relating to patents covering the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv and all litigation matters relating to patents and patent applications related to the use of l deoxy nucleosides for the treatment of hbv 
table of contents assigned to one or more of idenix  cnrs and l universite montpellier ii  or the university of montpellier  and which cover the use of telbivudine tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv have been resolved 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid uabrf on behalf of uab and emory university a million upfront payment and will make additional payments to uabrf equal to of all royalty payments received by us from novartis from worldwide sales of telbivudine  subject to minimum payment obligations aggregating million 
our payment obligations under the settlement agreement expire on august  the settlement agreement was effective on june  and included mutual releases of all claims and covenants not to sue among the parties 
it also included a release from a third party scientist who had claimed to have inventorship rights in certain idenix cnrs university of montpellier patents 
additionally  in connection with the resolution of matters relating to certain of our hcv drug candidates  in may  we entered into a settlement agreement with uab which provides for a milestone payment of million to uab upon receipt of regulatory approval in the united states to market and sell certain hcv products invented or discovered by our chief executive officer during the period from november  to november  this settlement agreement also provides that we will pay uab an amount equal to of worldwide net sales of such hcv products with a minimum sales based payment equal to million 
we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the universita degli studi di cagliari  or the university of cagliari  pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell certain hcv and hiv technologies 
we made certain payments to the university of cagliari under these arrangements based on the million payment we received from gsk in under the gsk license agreement 
we are also liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive license fees or milestone payments with respect to such technology from novartis  gsk or another collaborator 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation  or sumitomo  under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may the settlement agreement which we entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
in october  we entered into a two year research collaboration agreement with metabasis therapeutics  inc  or metabasis 
under the terms of the agreement  metabasis proprietary liver targeted technology would have been applied to one of our compounds to develop second generation nucleoside analog drug candidates for the treatment of hcv 
in july  we notified metabasis that we would exercise our option to terminate the research collaboration on the first anniversary of the agreement in october prior to the termination of the agreement  metabasis asserted that a certain scientific milestone was met and thus a million payment under the collaboration agreement came due 
we do not agree with metabasis assessment that the scientific milestone has been met and therefore do not believe that we have any liability for this payment and initially so notified metabasis 
in may  we and metabasis entered into a letter agreement whereby metabasis will apply its proprietary liver targeted technology to a compound developed by us 
if the results are considered positive  as measured by efficacy and safety in a predictive animal study  then we anticipate re instating the original agreement with metabasis  which was terminated in october if the original agreement with metabasis were to be re instated  then we would remain obligated to all the terms and conditions thereunder  including the potential payment of the million milestone 
in december  we retained the services of clariant subsequently acquired by archimica group  a provider of manufacturing services in the specialty chemicals industry  in the form of a multiproject development and supply agreement 
under the terms of the agreement with clariant  we would  on an as needed basis  utilize the clariant process development and manufacture services in the development of certain of our drug candidates  including telbivudine 
after reviewing respective bids from each of novartis and clariant  the joint manufacturing committee of idenix and novartis decided to proceed with novartis as the primary manufacturer of telbivudine 
in late  we transferred full responsibility to novartis for the development  commercialization and manufacturing of telbivudine 
as a result  in january  we exercised our right under the agreement with clariant to terminate the relationship effective july in 
table of contents february  clariant asserted that they should have been able to participate in the manufacturing process for telbivudine as a non primary supplier and therefore are due an unspecified amount 
we do not agree with clariant s assertion and therefore have not recorded a liability associated with this potential contingent matter 
clariant has not initiated legal proceedings 
if legal proceedings are initiated  we intend to vigorously defend against such lawsuit 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of marketable securities  accrued expenses and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important to the understanding and evaluating of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
 as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and  for revenue arrangements entered into after june   in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
we record revenue provided that there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payments to us for non refundable license fees  milestones  collaborative research and development funding and royalties received from our collaboration partners 
non refundable license fee payments where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue over the expected development period as we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period or no other performance pattern is evident  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of management 
payments received from collaboration partners for research and development efforts by us are recognized as revenue over the contract term as the related costs are incurred  net of any amounts due to the collaboration partner for costs incurred during the period for shared development costs 
where we have no continuing involvement or obligations under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement 
milestone payments revenues from milestones related to an arrangement under which we have continuing performance obligations  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  
table of contents achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended 
if any of these conditions is not met  the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
where we have no continuing involvement or obligations under a collaborative arrangement  we record milestones when we receive appropriate notification of achievement of the milestones by the collaboration partner 
collaboration revenue related party in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
this agreement has several joint committees in which we and novartis participate 
we participate in these committees as a means to govern or protect our interests 
the committees span the period from early development through commercialization of drug candidates licensed by novartis 
as a result of applying the provisions of sab no 
 which was the applicable revenue guidance at the time the collaboration was entered into  our revenue recognition policy attributes revenue to the development period of the drug candidates licensed under the development and commercialization agreement 
we have not attributed revenue to our involvement in the committees following the commercialization of the licensed products as we have determined that our participation on the committees as such participation relates to the commercialization of drug candidates is protective 
our determination is based in part on the fact that our expertise is  and has been  the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases 
novartis  on the other hand  has the considerable commercialization expertise and infrastructure necessary for the commercialization of such drug candidates 
accordingly  we believe our obligation post commercialization is inconsequential 
we recognize non refundable payments received from novartis over the performance period of our continuing obligations 
this period is estimated based on current judgments related to the product development timeline of our licensed drug candidates and is currently estimated to be approximately twelve and a half years following the effective date of the development and commercialization agreement that we entered into with novartis  or december we review our assessment and judgment on a quarterly basis with respect to the expected duration of the development period of our licensed drug candidates 
if the estimated performance period changes  we will adjust the periodic revenue that is being recognized and will record the remaining unrecognized non refundable payments over the remaining development period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
upon the grant of options and stock awards under stock incentive plans  with the exception of the equity incentive plan  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  if any  payable by the option or award holder  is recorded as a reduction of the non refundable payments associated with the novartis collaboration 
the amount is attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through the current date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
these amounts will be adjusted through the date that novartis elects to purchase the shares to maintain its percentage ownership based upon changes in the value of our common stock and in novartis percentage ownership 
as of december   the aggregate impact of novartis stock subscription rights has reduced the non refundable payments by million  which has been recorded as additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue with the remaining amount of million as a reduction of license fee revenue 
for the year ended december   the impact of novartis stock subscription rights reduced additional paid in capital by million  increased deferred revenue by million and increased license fee revenue by million 
royalty revenue consists of revenue earned under our license agreement with novartis for sales of tyzeka sebivo  which is recognized when reported from novartis 
royalty revenue is equal to a percentage of tyzeka sebivo net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage varies based on the specified territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 

table of contents other revenue in february  we entered into the gsk license agreement and granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
under this agreement  in march  we received a million non refundable license fee payment 
this agreement has performance obligations  including joint committee participation and gsk s right to license other nnrti compounds that we may develop in the future  that we have assessed under the fasb guidance related to multiple element arrangements 
we concluded that this arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
the million payment was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement  which is estimated to be years 
deferred revenue in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
if regulatory approval is not received for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
valuation and impairment of marketable securities our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  and december  were measured in accordance with fasb guidance 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize observable data such as quoted prices in active markets 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  under the heading fair value measurements  a majority of our marketable securities were classified as level our marketable securities are generally valued using information provided by a pricing service based on market observable information  or for money market investments at calculated net asset values 
the pricing service used many observable market inputs to determine value  including benchmark yields  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare evaluations 
in addition  model processes were used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios 
these models take into consideration relevant credit information  perceived market movements  sector news and economic events 
the inputs into these models may include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads and other relevant data 
we validated the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances 
we also had one investment classified as level  which was an auction rate security that does not actively trade 
we determined the fair value of the security based on a discounted cash flow model which incorporated a discount period  coupon rate  liquidity discount and coupon history 
we also considered in determining the fair value the rating of the security by investment rating agencies and whether or not the security was backed by the united states government 

table of contents accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves estimating the level of service performed by third parties on our behalf and the associated cost incurred for these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses in which subjective judgments may be required include services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation for employees and directors using a fair value based method that results in expense being recognized in our financial statements 
we make assumptions related to the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term of the awards granted in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
the expected option term and expected volatility are determined by examining the expected option term and volatility of our own stock as well as those of similarly sized biotechnology companies 
we review these assumptions periodically 
the amounts recognized for share based compensation expense could vary depending upon changes in these assumptions 
share based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest and should be reduced for estimated forfeitures 
during  and  because substantially all of our stock option grants vest monthly  no forfeiture assumption was applied 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we have allocated share based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this asu also eliminates the use of the residual method and instead requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
additionally  the guidance expands disclosure requirements with respect to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we plan to adopt this asu in the first quarter of prospectively for any new revenue arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment policy seeks to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
the distress in the financial markets over the past two years has caused certain investments to diminish liquidity and decline in value 
due to the failed auctions related to our auction rate security and the continued uncertainty in the credit markets  the market value of our securities may decline further and may prevent us from liquidating our holdings 
to mitigate this risk  beginning in  we began to shift our investments to instruments that carry less exposure to market volatility and liquidity pressures 
as of 
table of contents december   the majority of our investments were in government agency and treasury money market instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign currency transactions include agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in foreign currencies  european subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies and royalties earned based on worldwide product sales of sebivo by novartis 
as a result of these foreign currency transactions  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
