the table below presents the percentages of our total gross sales  net revenue and gross trade accounts receivable attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended december   and gross gross gross gross net accounts gross net accounts gross net accounts sales revenue receivable sales revenue receivable sales revenue receivable amerisourcebergen cardinal mckesson amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson are distributors of our products as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
none of these distributors is an end user of our products 
if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease  we believe that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor 
however  the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of these wholesalers 
a change in purchasing patterns  a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect for more information 
backorders 
as of december   we had approximately  of products on backorder as compared to approximately  of backorders as of december  we anticipate filling all current open backorders during government regulation 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies  including the fda  the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc and other federal  state and local agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market 
the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  non compliance with which can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve ndas and andas and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products 
fda approval is required before any application drug product can be manufactured and marketed 
new drugs require the application filing of an nda  including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug 
generic drugs  which are equivalents of existing  off patent brand name drugs  require the application filing of an anda 
an anda does not  for the most part  require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator 
however  the anda must  for example  provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability 
the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and  to a large extent  beyond our control 
we are subject to periodic inspections by the fda 
on march   we received an fda warning letter the warning letter following a routine inspection of our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility conducted in september the warning letter alleged violations of the current cgmp regulations 
we responded to the warning letter in april providing clarifying information and describing corrective actions planned and or completed after subsequent fda inspection of our decatur facility in july august and related communications between us and the fda  we were notified by the fda in december that all cgmp issues had been satisfactorily resolved  resulting in removal of the warning letter s potential restrictions on new product approvals  approval of the lyophilization and filling operations of the decatur facility and approval of the site transfer for manufacture of ic green to the decatur facility 
subsequent fda inspections  the most recent of which was conducted during the quarter ended june   have occurred at all akorn sites  with no subsequent observations resulting in warning letters 
the warning letter had no impact on fda approved products manufactured or distributed by our decatur facility  and we have continued to submit and received fda approval for the manufacture of additional new products at our manufacturing plants in decatur  illinois and somerset  new jersey 
throughout the five year period ended december   there have been no product interruptions associated with regulatory inspection or review activities 

table of contents product recalls 
we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during  due to the third quarter recall notification by becton  dickinson and company bd  of their ml syringe 
this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us  to support the cyanide antidote kit 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall  and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
we recorded a  additional provision to sales returns in to recognize the impact of this recall 
in  we recorded an additional sales returns provision of  which is net of a  settlement we received from bd related to the cyanide antidote kit recall 
our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda  as part of our due diligence in apprising the agency of our reaction to the bd recall 
there were no product recalls during and no new product recalls in dea regulation 
we also manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances  the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea 
failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product 
there were no dea citations issued to us in environment 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
foreign sales 
during  and  approximately   and  of our net revenue  respectively  was from customers located in foreign countries 
seasonality 
most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality other than td vaccines in the spring through fall seasons and flu vaccine products  which are typically sold in the august through november period 
we discontinued distribution of flu vaccines during and ceased distribution of td vaccines as of march  upon the termination of our mbl distribution agreement 
government contracts 
none of our business segments are generally subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

risk factors 
we have experienced recent operating losses  working capital deficiencies and negative cash flows from operations  and these losses and deficiencies may continue in the future 
our recent operating losses may continue in the future and there can be no assurance that our financial outlook will improve 
for the years  and  our operating losses were   and  respectively 
we generated negative operating cash flows of   and  in  and  respectively 
if our cash flow from operations does not improve  we may have to implement a restructuring plan in order to preserve our cash flow and continue business operations 
as of december   as a result of our lack of liquidity  limited capital resources  operating losses and accumulated debt  we had concluded that there was substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and our independent registered public accounting firm included in their report on our december  consolidated financial statements an explanatory paragraph describing the events that gave rise to this uncertainty 
these factors made it more difficult for us to obtain additional funding to meet our obligations 
while we and also our independent registered public accounting firm have concluded the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern is no longer applicable as of december   our ability to continue as a going concern over the long term is still dependent upon our ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a timely basis 
in the years  and combined  we recorded operating losses that totaled approximately million and generated negative operating cash flow of approximately million 
in spite of this past record of performance  we believe that current working capital and availability under our credit agreement will be sufficient for us to implement our operating plans and satisfy our cash requirements through december  however  we can offer no assurance that this will be the case 
further  we have no commitments in place to obtain additional capital  and should we require additional capital to fund our operating plans and obligations  we can offer no assurance that such financing would be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
availability under our credit agreement may be restricted if we fail to meet our covenant requirements 
we are party to a revolving credit agreement with ej funds lp ej funds  a company controlled by our chairman  dr 
john kapoor 
this credit agreement was originally entered into on january  as a million revolving credit agreement between general electric capital corporation ge capital and us 
on february   ge capital applied a reserve against availability under the credit agreement due to concerns about our prospective compliance with certain covenants  capping our borrowing availability at its then current outstanding balance  which was  on march   we consented to an assignment of rights and obligations under the credit agreement from ge capital to ej funds 
at that time  availability was capped at  but was subsequently increased to million on august  upon completion of negotiations with ej funds 
under the negotiated terms  agreed to in the negotiations  we are not subject to debt covenants until april  and therefore have no limit on availability through that date 
however  after that date  availability will be dependent upon our maintaining compliance with various covenants 
the financial covenants consist of a maximum limit on capital expenditures of  in and a requirement to have positive liquidity 
positive liquidity is defined as the revolving line of credit borrowing base up to  plus cash and cash equivalents less the outstanding principal on the revolving line of credit  the total of which is greater than zero 
should we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants  availability under the credit agreement could be restricted which would in turn negatively impact our liquidity and require us to seek additional sources of capital in order to maintain our continuing operations 
we will likely need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business 
it is likely that we will require additional funds in order to materially grow our business 
we require substantial liquidity to implement long term cost savings and restructuring plans  continue capital spending to support product programs and development of advanced technologies  meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities  and run our normal business operations 
we may seek additional funds through public and private financing  including equity and debt offerings 
however  adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us 
without sufficient additional funding  we may be required to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product development  manufacturing  acquisition  licensing and marketing initiatives  or operations 
further  such additional financing  if obtained  may require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest 

table of contents unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business 
our general business strategy may be adversely affected by the current economic downturn and volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
if the current equity and credit markets deteriorate further  or do not improve  it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult  more costly  and more dilutive 
a prolonged or profound economic downturn may result in adverse changes to product reimbursement  pricing or sales levels  which would harm our operating results 
there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers  manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times  which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget 
failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy  financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans 
there is also a possibility that our stock price may decline  due in part to the volatility of the stock market and the general economic downturn 
we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect 
a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a large portion of our gross sales  net revenues and accounts receivable 
the following three wholesalers  amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson  accounted for approximately of total gross sales and of total net revenues in  and of gross trade receivables as of december  in addition to acting as distributors of our products  these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products on behalf of many other companies 
the loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
a change in purchasing patterns  inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue  results of operations and cash flows 
our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities 
our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
we may not meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting 
our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays  which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products 
our failure to develop new products  to maintain substantial compliance with fda compliance guidelines or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances which may not result in marketable products 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products 
since  we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements  license agreements  and a joint venture that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline 
the joint venture company has generated several product introductions  however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional fda approved andas or ndas  or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit 
in addition  any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully market and distribute new products through various distribution channels 
we continue to seek out and introduce new pharmaceutical healthcare products 
our improved financial performance is dependent on new product introduction 
any delays or an inability to successfully market and distribute such products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our success depends on the development of generic and off patent pharmaceutical products  which are particularly susceptible to competition  substitution policies and reimbursement policies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to identify suitable branded pharmaceutical products to target for development of generic equivalents  determine or anticipate the dates when these branded pharmaceuticals are expected to come off patent  and time our product development activities accordingly so that we will be ready to manufacture and market our generic equivalent products at the most advantageous times 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than branded pharmaceuticals 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug 
table of contents dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
in addition  generic products developed by other third parties may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete  or may glut the market with competing products resulting in a reduction in sale price or market share for the generic products we sell 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we can be subject to legal proceedings against us  which may prove costly and time consuming even if without merit 
in the ordinary course of our business  we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies 
to the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future  this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future 
in addition  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings  the consequences could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties  which we cannot control 
we rely on external third parties to manufacture certain of the products we sell 
currently  due to our exit from the biologics vaccines segment  this risk is limited to products manufactured by strides for sale by the joint venture company  as well as a few akorn products that represent an immaterial percentage of our revenue and gross profit 
however  we expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our other strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our two manufacturing facilities 
if we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute such products as planned 
further  no assurance can be given that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our directors are subject to conflicts of interest

kapoor  is a principal shareholder of each of these companies 
as a result  dr 
kapoor does not devote his full time to our business 
although such companies do not currently compete directly with us  certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business 
discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subordinated debt 
potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key executive officers and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
we are particularly dependent upon john n 
kapoor  phd  chairman of our board of directors 
in addition to serving as our chairman  dr 
kapoor is also currently our primary lender on both our subordinated note and our credit agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit facility and subordinated debt 
the departure of dr 
kapoor as our chairman or the removal of his financial support from our business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents mr 
rajat rai currently serves as our interim chief executive officer under the terms of a consulting agreement expiring on december   and is subject to twelve month renewals thereafter 
our inability to attract and retain key executive officers  or the loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  our performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of our key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  and on our results of operations and financial condition 
through stock ownership  his position on our board of directors  and his loans to us  dr 
john kapoor has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies 
dr 
john kapoor owns  directly and indirectly  a substantial portion of our outstanding voting common stock 
dr 
kapoor is also chairman of our board of directors 
further  dr 
kapoor is a substantial creditor of ours 
as a result  dr 
kapoor can strongly influence  and potentially control  the outcome of our corporate actions  including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control 
decisions made by dr 
kapoor with respect to his  and his related parties  ownership or trading of our common stock  or with regards to our outstanding debt  could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines  prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities 
federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business 
the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by the fda  dea  ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities 
noncompliance with applicable united states and or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new  modified and additional regulations  statutes or legal interpretation  if any  could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
we are subject to regulation by the fda 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
this authority includes  but is not limited to  the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp  to recall products  to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications 
any such enforcement activities  including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  product recalls may be issued at our discretion  or at the request of the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products 
recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
no assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales  halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such actions  in certain circumstances  could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationships 
we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market which requires a regulatory submission 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
even if the fda or 
table of contents another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies or impose other post marketing obligations 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing  distribution  and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the fda changes its regulatory position  it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain products 
fda interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies  industry trends  and or prevailing scientific rationale 
if the fda changes its regulatory position due to such factors  it could result in our delay or suspension of the manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain of our products 
we believe that all of our current products are in substantial compliance with fda regulations and have received the requisite agency approvals for their manufacture and sale 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of products we market are non application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed by industry prior to the amendment of the fdc act 
the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and or challenge by the fda  which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing of such products  or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based 
any such change in the status of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive dea regulation  which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized 
we also manufacture and sell drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which impose  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market 
see item business dea regulation 
we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims  we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products  or items within our products  may prove to be defective and cause a health risk 
in that event  we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority 
we have recalled products in the past and  based on this experience  believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us  potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity  all of which could harm our ability to market our products 
we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during  due to the third quarter recall notification by bd  of their ml syringe 
this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us  to support the cyanide antidote kit 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall  and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda  as part of our due diligence in apprising the fda of our reaction to the bd recall 
there were no product recalls in or although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings  we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future 
even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity  hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business 
successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of  for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non prescription basis  which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products 
from time to time  the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis  without a prescription 
fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and  accordingly  reduce our profits 
our industry is very competitive 
additionally  changes in technology could render our products obsolete 
we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of our products 
we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price  service and technical capabilities 
there can be no assurance that i we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  or iii competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
further  in the case of many of our andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes 
the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights  including licensed rights  relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured  or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights  ii obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us  which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or obsoleting those that we are planning to develop  or duplicate any of our products 
our inability to obtain patents for  or other proprietary rights in  our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have registered shares held by certain of our investors for sale under registration statements filed with the sec 
sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline 

table of contents exercise of warrants and options may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock 
if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities  exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
changes to the market value of our outstanding warrants may negatively impact or create volatility in our reported net income 
during  we issued to ej funds and the kapoor trust various warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the warrants will expire five years from their grant dates if not exercised 
the warrants are adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter through black scholes calculations which considers changes in the market price of our common stock  the remaining contractual life of the warrants  and other factors 
any quarterly increase in the calculated market value of the warrants is recorded as a non operating expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the applicable period 
quarterly declines in value would similarly be recorded as non operating income 
for the year ended december   we recorded  in non operating expense related to the change in market value of these warrants since their issuance 
future increases in our stock price may require us to record higher non operating expenses and report lower net income loss and net income loss per share due to the quarterly change in fair value of our outstanding warrants 
while such changes in fair value will have no impact on our liquidity or cash flows  they would have a negative effect on our reported net income 
we may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock 
if we issue additional shares of preferred stock  it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we continue to seek capital for the growth of our business  and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of additional preferred stock 
we experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations  which may increase the volatility of our stock price 
our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products  the failure to develop such products  delays in obtaining government approvals  including fda approval of ndas or andas for our products  expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities  expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products  changes in our customer base  a customer s termination of a substantial account  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors  loss of key personnel  changes in the mix of products sold by us  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  competitive pricing pressures  expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
penny stock rules may make buying or selling our common stock difficult 
as of march   the market price of our common stock did not exceed per share 
because our market price has fallen below per share  trading in our common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules 
the sec has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
these rules would require that any broker dealer that would recommend our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors  must  prior to the sale  make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction 
unless an exception is available  the regulations would require the delivery  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market 
in addition  broker dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our common stock 

table of contents the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act 
these requirements are extensive 
the exchange act requires that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight is required 
this may divert management s attention from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

these factors combined to create doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and led us to conclude in our annual report on form k that there was substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a result of the changes detailed below and subsequent efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations  we have significantly improved our financial stability compared to a year ago 
this is evidenced by an improved balance sheet and improvements in operating performance throughout as a result  we were able to overcome the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during  we focused on stabilizing our operations and cash flows  resolving our issues with mbl and securing financing to resolve our liquidity problems 
our board of directors determined that management changes were necessary to help move the company forward 
accordingly  on june   raj rai was named interim chief executive officer ceo and tim dick was named chief financial officer cfo 
on march   we entered into a letter agreement with mbl in which we agreed to pay the  then due  plus an additional  in subsequent payments in consideration of amendments to the underlying mbl distribution agreement

the modification warrant expires five years after its issuance and is exercisable upon payment of the exercise price in cash or by means of a cashless exercise yielding a net share figure 
under the modification agreement  we have the right to convert the subordinated note into term indebtedness under the credit agreement in exchange for additional warrants  on terms substantially identical to the modification warrant  to purchase  shares of its common stock for each  of converted debt 
the exercise price of those warrants would also be per share

we are amortizing this balance on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the credit facility 
the total expense recorded in for the amortization of this capitalized balance was we classified the fair value of the modification warrant and the warrants issued in conjunction with its reimbursement and warrant agreement see note l commitments and contingencies as a current liability in accordance with asc  derivatives and headging formerly eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
this is a result of the requirement that the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants be registered shares which cannot be absolutely assured 
the liability at december  for all outstanding warrants has been estimated using a black scholes valuation model with the fair value per warrant ranging from to 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair values at december  included expected life ranging from to years  expected volatility of  dividend yield of  and risk free interest rate of 
on january   the parties entered into an amendment to the credit agreement which  among other things  reduced the number of financial covenants to two a cap on capital expenditures of  in  and a requirement to have positive liquidity throughout the life of the credit agreement

the contract services segment  which produces products for third party customers  based upon their specification  at a pre determined price  also recognizes sales upon the shipment of goods or upon delivery of the product or service as appropriate 
revenue is recognized when all of our obligations have been fulfilled and collection of the related receivable is probable 
provision for estimated doubtful accounts  chargebacks  rebates  discounts and product returns is made at the time of sale and is analyzed and adjusted  if necessary  at each balance sheet date 
allowance for chargebacks and rebates we enter into contractual agreements with certain third parties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations gpos to sell certain products at predetermined prices 
the parties have elected to have these contracts administered through wholesalers that buy the product from us and subsequently sell it to those third parties 
when a wholesaler sells products to one of 
table of contents the third parties that are subject to a contractual price agreement  the difference between the price paid to us by the wholesaler and the price under the specific contract is charged back to us by the wholesaler 
we track sales and submitted chargebacks by product number and contract for each wholesaler 
utilizing this information  we estimate a chargeback percentage for each product 
we reduce gross sales and increase the chargeback allowance by the estimated chargeback amount for each product sold to a wholesaler 
we reduce the chargeback allowance when we process a request for a chargeback from a wholesaler 
actual chargebacks processed can vary materially from period to period based upon actual sales volume through the wholesalers 
however  our provision for chargebacks is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
we obtain certain wholesaler inventory reports to aid in analyzing the reasonableness of the chargeback allowance that will be paid out in the future 
we assess the reasonableness of our chargeback allowance by applying the product chargeback percentage based on historical activity to the quantities of inventory on hand per the wholesaler inventory reports and an estimate of in transit inventory that is not reported on the wholesaler inventory reports at the end of the period 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our estimate of the percentage amount of wholesaler inventory that will ultimately be sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement is based on a six quarter trend of such sales through wholesalers 
we use this percentage estimate until historical trends or new information indicates that a revision should be made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our actual chargeback rate experience and new trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
during  and the first two quarters of  we estimated that of our wholesaler inventory would ultimately be sold to third parties subject to contractual price agreements 
in the third quarter of  we adjusted the estimated rate to 
we will continue to use the estimate in future periods until trends indicate that a revision should be made 
similarly  we maintain an allowance for rebates related to fee for service contracts and other programs with certain customers 
rebate percentages vary by product and by volume purchased by each eligible customer 
we track sales by product number for each eligible customer and then apply the applicable rebate percentage  using both historical trends and actual experience to estimate our rebate allowance 
we reduce gross sales and increase the rebate allowance by the estimated rebate amount when we sell our products to our rebate eligible customers 
we reduce the rebate allowance when we process a customer request for a rebate 
at each balance sheet date  we analyze the allowance for rebates against actual rebates processed and make necessary adjustments as appropriate 
actual rebates processed can vary materially from period to period 
however  our provision for rebates is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
the recorded allowances reflect our current estimate of the future chargeback and rebate liability to be paid or credited to our wholesaler and other customers under the various contracts and programs 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded chargeback and rebate expense of   and  respectively 
the allowance for chargebacks and rebates was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the current year decline in our allowance for chargebacks and rebates was the result of our key wholesalers reducing their targeted inventory carrying levels for our products during allowance for product returns certain of our products are sold with the customer having the right to return the product within specified periods and guidelines for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to pending expiration dates 
provisions are made at the time of sale based upon tracked historical experience  by customer in some cases 
in evaluating month end allowance balances  we consider actual returns to date that are in process  the expected impact of product recalls and the wholesaler s inventory information to assess the magnitude of unconsumed product that may result in a product return to us in the future 
we had previously estimated our sales returns reserve based on a historical percentage of returns to sales utilizing a twelve month look back period 
in  we performed a specific detailed review of returns by product lot and determined the lag time between product sale and return was longer than we had previously estimated 
the gross impact of this adjustment was  which was partially offset by  in reduced chargeback liability which specifically relates to this revision in the sales returns reserve estimate 
we recorded this change in estimate in the fourth quarter of one time historical factors or pending new developments that would impact the expected level of returns are taken into account to determine the appropriate reserve estimate at each balance sheet date 
the sales returns level can be impacted by factors such as overall market demand and market competition and availability for substitute products which can increase or decrease the end user pull through for sales of our products and ultimately impact the level of sales returns 
actual returns experience and trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
actual returns processed can vary materially from period to period 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded a net provision for product returns of   and  respectively 
the provision included an  provision related to our akten ophthalmic solution  along with increases due to lower than anticipated pull through on ophthalmic products and an increase in anticipated returns from wholesalers on certain other products 
the provision includes the impact of discontinuing our multi dose td vaccine product  a recall associated with a supplier s syringe in our cyanide antidote kit product  the revision in our lag estimate  increased sales and unfavorable wholesaler product returns experience 
the allowance for potential product returns was  and  at december  and  respectively 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts provisions for doubtful accounts  which reflect trade receivable balances owed to us that are believed to be uncollectible  are recorded as a component of sg a expenses 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our historical experience with collections and write offs  the credit quality of our customers and any recent or anticipated changes thereto  and the outstanding balances and past due amounts from our customers 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded a net expense benefit for doubtful accounts of   and  respectively 
the favorable experience in and was due to recoveries and reduced reserve requirements which exceeded write offs and reduced previously identified collectibility concerns 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had a total of  of past due gross accounts receivable  of which  was over days past due 
on a monthly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the receivables due from our wholesaler customers and provide a specific reserve against known uncollectible items for each of the wholesaler customers 
we also include in the allowance for doubtful accounts an amount that we estimate to be uncollectible for all other customers based on a percentage of the past due receivables 
the percentage we reserve increases as the age of the receivables increases 
allowance for slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost average cost method or market 
we maintain an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value nrv 
for finished goods inventory  we estimate the amount of inventory that may not be sold prior to its expiration or is slow moving based upon recent sales activity by unit and wholesaler inventory information 
we also analyzed our raw material and component inventory for slow moving items 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision for inventory obsolescence in cost of sales of   and  respectively 
the allowance for inventory obsolescence nrv was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision and allowance was mainly due to our decision to phase out certain products 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when  based on management judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints or impediments to approval 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the product timeline for approval 
during  we expensed  related to finished goods inventory of vancomycin capsules  as the fda review process for this product was extended resulting in uncertainty related to the recoverability of this inventory 
as of december   we have not yet received approval to sell vancomycin capsules 
warranty liability the product warranty liability primarily relates to a ten year expiration guarantee on dtpa sold to hhs in we are performing yearly stability studies for this product and  if the annual stability does not support the ten year product life  we will replace the product at no charge 
our supplier  hameln pharmaceuticals  will also share one half of this cost if the product does not meet the stability requirement 
if the ongoing product testing confirms the ten year stability for dtpa we will not incur a replacement cost and this reserve will be eliminated with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales after the ten year period 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards 
these items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
intangibles intangibles consist primarily of product licensing and other such costs that are capitalized and amortized on the straight line method over the lives of the related license periods or the estimated life of the acquired product  which range from years to years 
amortization expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we regularly assess the impairment of intangibles based on several factors  including estimated fair market value and anticipated cash flows 

table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options 
determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and requires judgment 
we use an expected volatility that is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life assumption is based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post vesting termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average market rate on us treasury securities in effect during the quarter in which the options were granted 
the dividend yield reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected term of the option 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise in subsequent periods  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates
