recent development on december   plpc and tyco electronics group sa tyco electronics completed a stock and asset purchase agreement  pursuant to which  plpc acquired from tyco electronics its dulmison business for million and the assumption of certain liabilities  subject to a customary post closing working capital adjustment 
we accounted for the acquisition of dulmison in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc  which includes provisions that were effective january  the new provisions significantly changed the accounting for business combinations both during the period of the acquisition and in subsequent periods 
in accordance with asc  transaction costs of million associated with the business combination were expensed and a gain of million on the acquisition of the business was recorded 
the acquisition of dulmison strengthens our position in the power distribution and transmission hardware market and will expand our presence in the asia pacific region 
as a result of the acquisition  we added operations in indonesia and malaysia and strengthened our existing positions in australia  thailand  mexico  and the united states 
discontinued operations our consolidated financial statements were impacted by the divestiture of superior modular products smp on may  we sold our smp subsidiary for million  for a 
million gain  net of tax  and a million to be held in escrow for one year 
during the year ended december   we received the remaining balance of 
million held in escrow 
we have not provided any significant continuing involvement in the operations of smp after the closing of the sale 
for tax purposes  the sale of smp generated a capital loss  which was not deductible except for amounts used to offset capital gains in a full valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax asset on the remaining portion of the capital loss carryover 
the operating results of smp are presented in our statements of consolidated income as discontinued operations  net of tax 
for the year ended december   income from discontinued operation  net of tax was 
million  or 
per diluted share 

table of contents market overview our business continues to be concentrated in the energy and communications markets 
during the past couple of years  industry consolidation continued as distributors and service provider consolidations took place in our major markets 
this trend is expected to continue in we have a growing concern that the continued global economic situation coupled with an already depressed us housing market  could further affect construction projects and negatively impact growth opportunities in our core markets in the us and countries such as spain  poland and great britain where the financial situation is expected to be similar going forward 
in  we again experienced growth in our energy markets 
we continued to see the investment in new transmission grids  new technologies  and upgrading and maintenance of the existing energy infrastructure 
we expect the distribution energy market to be flat in but anticipate continued growth in demand for transmission and fiber optic products 
the acquisition of dulmison from tyco electronics in late will further cement plp s leadership position and will enable plp to enhance the scope of its product lines and the technology it provides to this important market 
dulmison s spacer  spacer damper and stockbridge damper product lines fit well and complement plp s product offerings and enable plp to offer the most comprehensive line of products in the industry 
with demand for electrical power continuing to increase  especially in many fast growing areas of the world  plp s leadership position in the market will enable it to take advantage of prospects for continued growth as the transmission grid is enhanced and extended 
our international business is more concentrated in the energy markets 
historically  our international sales were primarily related to the distribution portion of the energy market 
we believe that we are well positioned to supply the needs of the world s diverse energy market requirements as a result of our strategically located operations and array of product designs and technologies 
the year was challenging for plp s communication business throughout the world 
many communications customers cut back on capital and operational spending as the global economic downturn negatively impacted consumer spending on communication services 
the us was hit especially hard as communication carriers diverted operational funds to wireless communication projects where they could realize a faster return on their spending and investments 
also  the broadband stimulus program that was announced early in failed to gain traction throughout the year and the administrative burden of the program has further delayed the deployment of funds 
through all of this  plp maintained its focus on the customer and put resources towards new product development efforts 
these efforts were directed at customer premise and demarcation applications which are the final connections between the network and the end consumer 
as economic conditions improve and stimulus funds eventually start flowing into projects  plp s efforts in these areas will lead to growth in the communications business 
opportunities for growth also look promising in central and south america where deployment of fixed line telecommunications services and broadband penetration rates remain low as a percentage of the total population 
preface our consolidated financial results for the year ended december    and include the financial results of our solar energy operation  direct power and water dpw  acquired on march   belos  in poland  acquired on september  and bluesky energy pty ltd

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations  have proactively managed working capital and have controlled capital spending 
we currently have a debt to equity ratio of and can borrow needed funds at an affordable interest rate from our untapped credit facility 
while current worldwide conditions necessitate that we concentrate our efforts on maintaining our financial strengths  we believe there are many available opportunities for growth 
we are pursuing these opportunities as appropriate in the current environment in order to position ourselves for when the economic recovery ultimately happens 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
our discussions of the financial results include non gaap measures primarily the impact of foreign currency to provide additional information concerning our financial results that are prepared in accordance with gaap

one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk to make up a deficiency from market value attributable to damage  extraordinary wear and tear  excess air hours or exceeding maintenance overhaul schedules required by the federal aviation administration 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be immaterial because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value 
our financial position remains strong and our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  our current ratio decreased primarily due to increases in debt  trade payables and accrued expenses related to business acquisitions 
at december   our unused balance under our main credit facility was million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 
the revolving credit agreement contains  among other provisions  requirements for maintaining levels of working capital  net worth and profitability 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
on february   we entered into a new revolving credit agreement of million  carrying interest at libor plus with a term expiring january we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our untapped borrowing capacity  provides substantial financial resources 
if we were to incur significant additional indebtedness  we expect to be able to meet liquidity needs under the credit facilities 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are summarized in the following tables payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years thousands of dollars notes payable to bank a long term debt b capital leases operating leases purchase commitments pension contribution and other retirement plans c income taxes payable  non current d amount of commitment expiration by period less than after other commercial commitments total year years years years thousands of dollars letters of credit guarantees a interest on short term debt is included in the table at an interest rate of in effect at december  b interest on long term debt is included in the table at interest rates from

at december   the company s unfunded contractual obligation was million 
the company s supplemental profit sharing plan accrued liability at december  was million 
future expected amounts have not been disclosed as the company is unable to estimate the years in which benefit payments may occur 
d as of december   there were 
million of tax liabilities  including interest  related to unrecognized tax benefits 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  if any  the company is unable to estimate the years in which cash settlement may occur with the respective tax authorities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
sales recognition we record sales when products are shipped and the title and risk of loss has passed to unaffiliated customers 
revenue related to shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold 
receivable allowances allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents approximately of our trade receivable at december  and of our trade receivable at december  reserve for credit memos we maintain an allowance for future sales credits related to sales recorded during the year 
our estimated allowance is based on historical sales credits issued in the subsequent year related to the prior year and any significant open return good authorizations as of the balance sheet date 
our allowance is updated on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for out of period credits represents less than of our trade receivables at december  and approximately of our trade receivables at december  excess and obsolescence reserves we provide excess and obsolescence reserves to state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
we identify inventory items which have had no usage or are in excess of the usages over the historical to months 
a management team with representatives from marketing  manufacturing  engineering and finance reviews these inventory items  determines the disposition of the inventory and assesses the estimated market value based on their knowledge of the product and market conditions 
these conditions include  among other things  future demand for product  product utility  unique customer order patterns or unique raw material purchase patterns  
table of contents changes in customer and quality issues 
at december  and  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was and of gross inventory 
if the impact of market conditions worsens from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
our measurement date for our annual impairment test is january of each year 
we perform interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
there were no trigger events during and as such  only an annual impairment test was performed 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we established a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions we identify tax positions taken on the federal  state  local and foreign income tax returns filed or to be filed 
a tax position can include a reduction in taxable income reported in a previously filed tax return or expected to be reported on a future tax return that impacts the measurement of current or deferred income tax assets or liabilities in the period being reported  a decision not to file a tax return  an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions  the characterization of income or a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return  or a decision to classify a transaction  entity or other position in a tax return as tax exempt 
we determine whether a tax position is an uncertain or a routine business transaction tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained at the full amount upon examination 
under asc formerly fin  tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce our current or future income tax liability  are reported in our financial statements only to the extent that each benefit was recognized and measured under a two step approach 
the first step requires us to assess whether each tax position based on its technical merits and facts and circumstances as of the reporting date  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the second step measures the amount of tax benefit that we recognize in the financial statements  based on a cumulative probability approach 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold that is not highly certain is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely 
table of contents of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority  assuming that the tax authority has examined the position and has full knowledge of all relevant information 
asc requires subjectivity of judgments to identify outcomes and to assign probability in order to estimate the settlement amount 
we provide estimates in order to determine settlement amounts 
during the year ended december   we recognized a benefit of 
million of uncertain tax positions 
at december   the total reserve for uncertain tax positions and related interest is million 
pensions we record obligations and expenses related to pension benefit plans based on actuarial valuations  which include key assumptions on discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and compensation increases 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
the effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
the discount rate of at december  reflects an analysis of yield curves as of the end of the year and the schedule of expected cash needs of the plan 
the expected long term return on plan assets of reflects the plan s historical returns and represents our best estimate of the likely future returns on the plan s asset mix 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience  market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries 
however  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost  while a decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  an increase in the expected long term return on plan assets would decrease the net periodic pension cost  while a decrease in expected long term return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost
