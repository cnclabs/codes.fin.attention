table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of data driven and transaction based marketing and customer loyalty solutions 
we offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions  including customer loyalty programs  database marketing services  marketing strategy consulting  analytics and creative services  permission based email marketing and private label retail credit card programs 
we focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through a variety of consumer marketing channels  including in store  catalog  mail  telephone and on line 
we capture data created during each customer interaction  analyze the data and leverage the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers  as well as to enhance customer loyalty 
we believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as companies continue to shift their marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing campaigns toward more targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments 
we operate in the following business segments loyalty services  epsilon marketing services  private label credit and private label services 
loyalty services 
the loyalty services segment generates revenue primarily from our coalition loyalty program in canada 
in our air miles reward program  we primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and  in limited circumstances  the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of loyalty services revenue and indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued reflects the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors  who pay us a fee per air miles reward mile issued 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represent future revenue and earnings for us 
the revenue related to the service element of the air miles reward miles which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors is initially deferred and amortized over a period of months  which is the estimated life of an air miles reward mile  beginning with the issuance of the air miles reward mile and ending upon its expected redemption 
air miles reward miles redeemed redemptions show that collectors are redeeming air miles reward miles to collect the rewards that are offered through our programs  which is an indicator of the success of the program 
we recognize revenue from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
the revenue related to the redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the air miles reward miles or over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile in the case of air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unused by the collector base or breakage 
we currently estimate breakage to be of air miles reward miles issued 
there have been no changes to management s estimate of the life of a mile in the periods presented 
our estimated breakage changed from one third to effective june  see note  deferred revenue  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our air miles reward program tends to be resilient during economic swings  because many of our sponsors are in non discretionary retail categories such as grocery stores  gas stations and pharmacies 
additionally  we target the sponsors most loyal customers  who we believe are unlikely to significantly change their spending patterns 
we are impacted by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 

table of contents epsilon marketing services 
the epsilon marketing services segment is a leader in providing integrated direct marketing solutions that combine database marketing technology and analytics with a broad range of direct marketing services 
epsilon marketing services has over clients  primarily in the financial services  specialty retail  hospitality and pharmaceutical end markets 
private label services 
the private label services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of statements generated  customer calls handled  remittance processing  customer care and various marketing services 
statements generated represent the number of statements generated for our credit cards 
the number of statements generated in any given period is a fairly reliable indicator of the number of active account holders during that period 
companies are increasingly outsourcing their non core processes such as billing and customer care 
the private label services segment is primarily affected by those industry trends that affect our private label credit segment as discussed below 
private label credit 
the private label credit segment provides risk management solutions  account origination and funding services for our more than private label retail and co branded credit card programs 
private label credit primarily generates revenue from securitization income  servicing fees from our securitization trusts and merchant discount fees 
private label credit sales and average managed receivables are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
private label credit sales this represents the dollar value of private label credit card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites 
generally  we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our program 
private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card banks 
average managed receivables this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders at the beginning of each month during the period in question 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that drive the outstanding balances  such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
the private label credit segment is affected by increased outsourcing in targeted industries 
the growing trend of outsourcing private label retail credit card programs leads to increased accounts and balances to finance 
we focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub prime borrowers 
additionally  economic trends can impact this segment 
interest expense is a significant component of operating costs for the securitization trusts 
corporate other 
this includes corporate overhead which is not allocated to our segments  as well as all other immaterial businesses

discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
securitization of credit card receivables 
we utilize a securitization program to finance a majority of the credit card receivables that we underwrite 
we use our off balance sheet securitization program to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital 
in a securitization transaction  we sell credit card receivables originated by our private label credit segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables  an equity interest in the trust  an interest in the receivables and retained interests in our subordinated notes 
our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis 
the securitization trusts are deemed to be qspes under gaap and are appropriately not included in our consolidated financial statements 
our interest in our securitization program is represented on our consolidated balance sheets as seller s interest our interest in the receivables and due from securitizations our retained interests and credit enhancement components 

table of contents the trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions 
the proceeds from the bonds and other debt are used to fund the receivables  while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs 
the excess spread is remitted to us as securitization income 
our residual interest  often referred to as an interest only strip  is recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our interest only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we will receive over the estimated life of the receivables  which ranges from months to months 
this anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond and note holders  estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses 
because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets  we estimate the fair value of the interest only strip primarily based upon discount  payment and default rates  which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest only strip 
the fair value of the interest only strip  and the corresponding gain or loss  will be impacted by the estimated excess spread over the following two or three quarters 
the excess spread is impacted primarily by finance and late fees collected  net charge offs and interest rates 
changes in the fair value of the interest only strip are reflected in our financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark to market changes of our residual interest 
in recording and accounting for interest only strips  we make assumptions about rates of payments and defaults that we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value 
due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions  the actual rates of principal payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates  and these differences could sometimes be material 
if actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed  the value of the interest only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value would be recorded in earnings 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip  the impact could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  a change in the net charge off rate assumption for our securitized credit card receivables could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the value of the interest only strip as of december  we also retain certain subordinated beneficial interests in our securitized assets  primarily class m  class b  class c and class d notes issued by the securitization trusts as well as seller s interest 
seller s interest ranks pari passu with investors interests in the securitization trusts and is carried on our consolidated financial statements at an allocated carrying amount based on their estimated fair value 
changes in the fair values of our seller s interest are recorded through securitization income and finance charges  net  in our consolidated statements of income 
we determine the fair value of our seller s interest through discounted cash flow models 
the estimated cash flows used include assumptions related to rates of payments and defaults  which reflect economic and other relevant conditions 
the discount rate used is based on an interest rate curve that is observable in the market place plus a credit spread 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of seller s interest  it could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example a change in the net charge off rate assumption could have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the value of the seller s interest as of december  our retained interests are classified as available for sale investment securities and are carried on our consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair values 
changes in the fair values of these notes are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the fair value of these securities are estimated utilizing discounted cash flow models  where the interest and principal payments are discounted at assumed current market rates for the same or comparable transactions 
in doing these valuations  management makes certain assumptions about the credit spreads the market participants would demand on the same or similar investments given the currently inactive market for credit card asset backed securities 
assumed discount rates 
table of contents are derived from indicative pricing observed in the most recent active market for such instruments  adjusted for changes occurring thereafter in relative credit spreads and liquidity risk premiums 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of our retained interests  it could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  a change in the discount rate could have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the value of the retained interest as of december  see note  securitization of credit card receivables  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we recognize the implicit forward contract to sell new receivables during a revolving period at its fair value at the time of sale 
the implicit forward contract is entered into at the market rate and thus  its initial measure is zero at inception 
in addition  we do not mark the forward contract to fair value in accounting periods following the securitization because management has concluded that the fair value of the implicit forward contract in subsequent periods is not material 
we believe that servicing fees received represent adequate compensation based on the amount currently demanded by the marketplace 
additionally  these fees are the same as would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required and  thus  we neither record a servicing asset nor servicing liability 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components as follows redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or  for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption 
under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile of months and a breakage rate of subsequent to june  and one third for previous periods presented 
in may  we secured a comprehensive long term renewal and expansion agreement with bank of montreal as a sponsor in the air miles reward program  pursuant to which bank of montreal transferred to us the responsibility of reserving for costs associated with the redemption of air miles reward miles issued by bank of montreal as a sponsor 
we received million for the assumption of this liability 
historically  air miles reward miles issued by bank of montreal have been excluded from our estimate of breakage as bank of montreal had the responsibility of redemption  and therefore no breakage estimate was required 
however  changing the nature of our agreement required us to include these miles in our analysis  which impacted both the redemption rate and our estimate of breakage 
after evaluating the impact of this transaction  we adjusted our estimate of breakage from one third to 
the decline in the breakage rate assumption was due to greater redemption activity by collectors who use bank of montreal credit cards 
the change in estimate had no impact on the total redemption liability  but reduced the amount of deferred breakage within the redemption liability that is expected to be recognized over the expected life of the air miles reward mile 

table of contents we believe that the issuance and redemption of air miles reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors  the type of rewards offered  the overall health of the canadian economy  the nature and extent of air miles reward program promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs 
throughout the history of the program  management has and will continue to make changes to the structure of the program that influence the redemption rate  and thus the breakage rate and estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
prior changes to the program have included zone pricing for air travel and new merchandise introductions 
these changes are made to the program not only to manage redemption activity but to respond to market conditions as well 
macroeconomic factors  such as the overall health of the canadian economy  may impact collector behavior and such factors may influence redemption activity intermittently 
breakage and the life of an air miles reward mile are based on management s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis  current run rates and other pertinent factors  such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage are actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
as of december   we had  million in deferred revenue related to the air miles reward program that will be recognized in the future 
further information is provided in note  deferred revenue  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  fasb accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
we used a binomial lattice option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
no options were issued during or see note  stock compensation plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the application of asc income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of  and guidance surrounding  income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding asc 
table of contents accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations in june  the fasb issued guidance codified in asc  transfers and servicing  related to accounting for transfers of financial assets and asc  consolidation  related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
asc removes the concept of a qspe and eliminated the consolidation exception available for qspes 
asc requires an initial evaluation as well as an ongoing assessment of the our involvement with the operations of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of these securitization trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on the balance sheet of wfnnb  wfcb or their affiliates  including us 
the assessment of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust under asc and asc resulted in the consolidation of the securitization trusts on the balance sheet of wfnnb  wfcb or their affiliates  including us  effective january  based on the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by asc  we expect to record a billion increase in assets  including billion to loan loss reserves  an increase in liabilities of billion and a billion reduction in stockholders equity 
after adoption  our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income  but will instead report interest income  and certain other income associated with all securitized credit card receivables 
net charge offs associated with credit card receivables will be reflected in our cost of operations 
interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors will be reported in interest expense 
additionally  after adoption  we will no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card receivables will no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
further  we will not record any gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing 
because our securitization transactions will be accounted for as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions will be presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating or investing activities 
the banking regulatory agencies issued regulatory capital rules in january relating to the adoption of the new accounting consolidation standards 
these regulatory transition rules permit an optional two quarter implementation delay  which may be followed by a two quarter partial implementation 
the effect of these transition rules defers the impact of the newly consolidated trusts to risk weighted assets and the related risk based capital requirements 
we elected these regulatory capital transition rules for our newly consolidated securitization trusts 
after adoption of the new standards  regulatory capital amounts and ratios are estimated to exceed well capitalized minimum standards 
we are prepared to provide capital support  if necessary  to support growth plans 
should support be required  regardless of form  we do not expect that it will require us to raise new capital or limit our stock repurchase program and other growth initiatives 
inter segment sales our private label services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to our private label credit segment 
for this  our private label services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin 
the margin is based on current estimated market rates for similar services 
this fee represents an operating cost to the private label credit segment and corresponding revenue for our private label services segment 
inter segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation 
revenues earned by our private label services segment from servicing our private label credit segment  and consequently paid by our private label credit segment to our private label services segment  are set forth under eliminations in the tables presented in the annual comparisons in our results of operations 

table of contents use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to income from continuing operations  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus stock compensation expense  provision for income taxes  interest expense  net  loss on the sale of assets  merger and other costs  depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles 
we use adjusted ebitda as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management 
adjusted ebitda is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets  the impact of related impairments  as well as asset sales through other financial measures  such as capital expenditures  investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the non cash effect of stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted ebitda provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations 
therefore  we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is not intended to represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
the adjusted ebitda measure presented in this annual report on form k may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies  and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements

adjusted ebitda decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by the change in foreign exchange rates by approximately million 
however  the decrease in adjusted ebitda was partially offset by the growth in redemption and issuance revenue as previously described combined with a lower cost structure achieved through operating leverage

asset quality our delinquency and net charge off rates reflect  among other factors  the credit risk of our private label credit card receivables  the average age of our various private label credit card account portfolios  the success of our collection and recovery efforts  and general economic conditions 
the average age of our private label credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio 
we continue to focus resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts and on collections and post charge off recovery efforts to minimize net losses 
an older private label credit card portfolio generally drives a more stable performance in the portfolio 
at december   of our managed accounts with balances and of managed receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than months old 
at december   of our managed accounts with balances and of managed receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than months old 
delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
when an account becomes delinquent  we print a message on the cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a 
table of contents proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house efforts  we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
we have historically generated cash flows from operations  although that amount may vary based on fluctuations in working capital and the timing of merchant settlement activity 
our operating cash flow is seasonal  with cash utilization peaking at the end of december due to increased activity in our private label credit segment related to holiday retail sales 
we generated cash flow from operating activities of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in cash flows in the year ended december  were impacted by an increase in deferred revenue related to a change in contractual terms with bmo bank of montreal 
in may  we assumed bmo bank of montreal s liability for the cost of redemptions for their outstanding air miles reward miles  for which we received million in cash 
we utilize our cash flow from operations for ongoing business operations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
investing activities 
cash used in investing was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in significant components of investing activities are as follows acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we had payments for acquired businesses totaling million related to the assumption of charming shoppes credit card programs and service center operations and acquisition of the credit card files and certain other assets

securitizations and receivables funding 
we generally fund private label credit card receivables through a securitization program that provides us with both liquidity and lower borrowing costs 
as of december   we had over billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread accounts and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is partially funded through the use of certificates of deposit issued through our subsidiaries  wfnnb and wfcb 
net securitization and credit card receivable activity used million for the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period in we intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the prior year 
we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately of our annual revenue for the foreseeable future 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to cash used by financing activities of million in our financing activities for related primarily to borrowings and repayments of debt and certificates of deposits  proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes due  proceeds from the issuance of warrants  payments for convertible note hedges  the purchase of prepaid forward contracts and repurchases of common stock 
liquidity sources 
in addition to cash generated from operating activities  our primary sources of liquidity include our securitization program  certificates of deposit issued by wfnnb and wfcb  our credit facility and issuances of equity securities 

table of contents in addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current facilities  we continue to seek new sources of liquidity 
certain of the announced government programs  such as the term asset backed securities loan facility  have facilitated the issuance of asset backed securities and improved market conditions  thus enabling us to replace maturing or short term funding as discussed in note  securitization of credit card receivables  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also expanded our brokered certificates of deposit to supplement liquidity for our credit card receivables 
we believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed above will be sufficient to meet working capital needs  capital expenditures  and other business requirements  for at least the next months 
securitization program and off balance sheet transactions 
since january  we have sold a majority of the credit card receivables originated by wfnnb to wfn credit company  llc and wfn funding company ii  llc  which in turn sold them to the wfn trusts as part of our securitization program 
in september  we initiated a securitization program for the credit card receivables originated by wfcb  selling them to world financial capital credit company  llc which in turn sold them to the wfc trust 
these securitization programs are the primary vehicle through which we finance wfnnb s and wfcb s credit card receivables 
historically  we have used both public and private asset backed securities transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our credit card receivables 
private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset backed securitization transactions 
we have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our portfolio of securitized credit card receivables originated by wfnnb and wfcb 
however  certain of these commitments are short term in nature and subject to renewal 
there is not a guarantee that these funding sources  when they mature  will be renewed on similar terms or at all based on recent unsuitable volumes and pricing levels in the asset backed securitization markets 
in march  we renewed our vfc conduit facility  increasing its capacity from million to million and extended the maturity of our vfn conduit facility  increasing its capacity from million to million 
as part of these two transactions  we increased our retained interests in subordinated notes by million 
in april  world financial network credit card master note trust issued million of term asset backed securities to investors  including those participating in the us government s talf program 
these notes will mature in november as part of this transaction  we retained all of the million of subordinated classes of notes 
proceeds of this issuance were used to retire the vfn conduit facility  including the retained subordinated notes held by us 
in june  we sold two portfolios of credit card receivables  which were acquired in  to our securitization trusts 
we sold a net principal balance of million at par  retaining million in a spread deposit account  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in august  world financial network credit card master note trust issued million of term asset backed securities to investors  including those participating in the us government s talf program 
the offering consisted of million of series b asset backed notes which mature in july  million of series c asset backed notes which mature in july  and million of series d asset backed notes which mature in july we retained million of these series 
in september  we renewed world financial network credit card master note trust s vfn conduit facility  increasing its capacity from billion to billion and extending its maturity to september as part of this transaction  we increased our retained interests in subordinated notes by million from million to million 

table of contents in september  we renewed world financial capital master note trust s vfn conduit facility  increasing its capacity from million to million and extending its maturity to september as part of this transaction  we increased our retained interests in subordinated notes by million from million to million

as of december   the wfn trusts and the wfc trust had approximately billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread deposits and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the wfn trusts and the wfc trust and by the performance of the private label credit cards in these securitization trusts 
the wfn trusts and wfc trust are required to maintain a credit enhancement level of between and of securitized credit card receivables 
the following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of december  for the wfn trusts and the wfc trust by year thereafter total in millions public notes private conduits total represents borrowing capacity  not outstanding borrowings 
private conduits are typically day facilities which are renewed annually 
early amortization events are generally driven by asset performance 
the wfn trusts excess spread has not significantly deteriorated in as increased losses have been offset by a significant decrease in short term borrowing rates 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely for an early amortization event to occur due to asset performance 
however  if an early amortization event were declared  the trustee of the particular securitization trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the securitization investors were fully repaid 
the occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional receivables 
debt certificates of deposit 
we utilize certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our credit card bank subsidiaries  wfnnb and wfcb 
wfnnb and wfcb issue certificates of deposit in denominations of  in various maturities ranging between one month and five years and with effective annual interest rates ranging from to 
as of december   we had billion of certificates of deposit outstanding 
certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements

the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur 
purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table 
purchase obligations include purchase commitments under our air miles reward program  minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services 
we believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation 
for the most part  we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology  as well as decreases in technology and communication costs  to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
our revenues  earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the third and fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down 
regulatory matters wfnnb is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the occ 
wfcb is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the fdic and the state of utah 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
under the fdic s order approving wfcb s application for deposit insurance  wfcb must meet specific capital ratios and paid in capital minimums and must maintain adequate allowances for loan losses 
if wfcb fails to meet the terms of the fdic s order  the fdic may withdraw insurance coverage from wfcb  and the state of utah may withdraw its approval of wfcb 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  wfnnb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
wfnnb is limited in the amounts that it can pay as dividends to us 
quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require wfnnb to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets and of tier capital to average assets 
under the regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order 
an adequately capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least  but is allowed in some cases 
under these guidelines  wfnnb is considered well capitalized 
as of december   wfnnb s tier capital ratio was  total capital ratio was and leverage ratio was  and wfnnb was not subject to a capital directive order 
on april   wfcb received non disapproval notification for a modification of the original three year business plan 
the letter of non disapproval was issued jointly by the state of utah and the fdic 
wfcb  under the terms of the letter  must maintain total risk based capital equal to or exceeding of total risk based assets and must maintain tier capital to total assets ratio of not less than 
both capital ratios were maintained at or above the indicated levels until the end of the bank s de novo period on november  as part of a portfolio acquisition in by wfnnb  which required approval by the occ  the occ required wfnnb to enter into an operating agreement with the occ the operating agreement and a capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement with us the calma 
the operating 
table of contents agreement required wfnnb to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its current practices  regulatory guidelines and applicable law  including those related to affiliate transactions  maintenance of capital and corporate governance 
in august  we entered into a revised operating agreement with wfnnb and the occ the operating agreement  which required us to enter into both a new capital adequacy and liquidity maintenance agreement the calma and a capital and liquidity support agreement the calsa with wfnnb 
the operating agreement has not required any changes in wfnnb s operations 
the calma and calsa memorialize our current obligations to ensure that wfnnb remains in compliance with its minimum capital requirements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance codified in asc  transfers and servicing  related to accounting for transfers of financial assets and asc  consolidation  related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
asc removes the concept of a qspe and eliminates the consolidation exception currently available for qspes 
it is effective for financial asset transfers on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after november  and early adoption is prohibited 
asc requires an initial evaluation as well as an ongoing assessment of our involvement with the operations of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of these securitization trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on the balance sheet of wfnnb  wfcb or their affiliates  including us 
the assessment of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust under asc and asc will result in the consolidation of the securitization trusts on the balance sheet of wfnnb  wfcb or their affiliates  including us  beginning january  based on the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by asc  we expect to record a billion increase in assets  including billion to loan loss reserves  an increase in liabilities of billion and a billion reduction in stockholders equity 
after adoption  our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income  but will instead report interest income  and certain other income associated with all securitized credit card receivables 
net charge offs associated with credit card receivables will be reflected in our cost of operations 
interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors will be reported in interest expense 
additionally  after adoption  we will no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card receivables will no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
further  we will not record any gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing 
because our securitization transactions will be accounted for as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions will be presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating or investing activities 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu supersedes certain guidance in asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements and requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices the relative selling price method 
asu eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation in which the undelivered element is measured at its estimated selling price and the delivered element is measured as the residual of the arrangement consideration  and requires the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables subject to asu asu will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
if we elect early adoption and the adoption is during an interim period  we will be required to apply this asu retrospectively from the beginning of our fiscal year 
we can also elect to apply this asu retrospectively for all periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asu amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements related to level measurements 
asu also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
asu will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  except for the requirement to provide the level disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements  which will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu will only impact disclosures and would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  subsequent events  to remove the requirement for an entity that files or furnished financial statements with the sec to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both originally issued and restated financial statements 
restated financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of correction of an error or retrospective application of us gaap 
the asu removes potential conflicts with the sec s literature 
we adopted asu in february item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include off balance sheet risk  interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
off balance sheet risk 
we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  including commitments to extend credit and through our securitization program 
the securitization trusts enter into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions 
the securitization program involves elements of credit  market  interest rate  legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest only strips 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total borrowing costs  including off balance sheet swap payments  were approximately million for  which includes both on and off balance sheet transactions 
of this total  million of the interest expense for was attributable to on balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables  which are financed off balance sheet 
to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on and off balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  through the securitization trusts  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 

table of contents at december   we had billion of debt  including billion of off balance sheet debt from our securitization program 
as of december  fixed rate variable rate total in millions off balance sheet on balance sheet total at december   our fixed rate off balance sheet debt was locked at a current effective interest rate of which included off balance sheet variable rate debt fixed through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   our fixed rate on balance sheet variable rate debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pre tax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pre tax income of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pre tax income 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
we have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters 
to minimize our risk of loan write offs  we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices 
we monitor the buying limits  as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
we generally do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary 
a increase in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in an increase in pre tax income of million as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the exchange rate would result in a comparable decrease to pre tax income 
redemption reward risk 
through our air miles reward program  we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards 
to minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs  we have multi year supply agreements with several canadian  us and international airlines  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards  which are typically lower cost per air miles reward mile than air travel  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using air miles reward miles alone  and periodically adjust the number of air miles reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward 

table of contents a increase in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of million  as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would result in a comparable increase to pre tax income
