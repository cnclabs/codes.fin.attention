item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three years ended december  general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  semiconductor dram memory  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
our results were favorably impacted in and as the worldwide demand for cell phones  smart phones  laptops and other consumer electronics remained strong  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules  and thereby increasing demand for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products 
after peaking in the third quarter of  our revenue declined sequentially each quarter through the first quarter of  as our results were negatively impacted by reduced levels of capital spending for electronics manufacturing capacity brought about by the deepening weakness in the global economy 
new orders dropped off sharply late in the fourth quarter of as the global economy fell into a severe recession  and our results for were adversely affected by the ongoing weakness in the global electronics market 
revenues were million in  down from million in the same period last year 
we lost million from operations in  down from a million loss from operations in our loss from operations in included a million non cash pre tax charge for goodwill impairment 
even before the recession  we worked to improve the efficiencies of our operations 
in february  we commenced plans to move a significant portion of our systems related product development and manufacturing to singapore 
the transition of these functions to singapore was substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of and has resulted in lower costs and a more focused r d effort 
further  in direct response to the recession  we implemented workforce reductions in november and february  including consolidation of manufacturing operations for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters facility 
from the start of the fourth quarter of through the end of the second quarter of  we reduced our workforce by employees or approximately  resulting from the move to singapore  relocation of manufacturing for our semiconductor operations  and the november and february workforce reductions 
implementation of these cost reduction actions has not impacted any of our strategic growth programs 
we also continued to work on our next generation inspection technology and various other growth programs during the recession 
we invested heavily during and in our next generation se solder paste inspection system and introduced this new system  which we believe is the fastest and most accurate solder paste inspection system available  in the second quarter of in november  we introduced our qx aoi system  which uses a cost reduced design that was created using sensor technology that we believe we can replicate and apply to generate a family of products with price points and functionality that meets the needs of a larger group of customers 
we have also signed three new oem development contracts during  two with manufacturers of electronic assembly equipment for embedded inspection functionality  and a third in a new market for us the photovoltaic solar market 
one of these new products provides d solder paste inspection with no cycle time penalty  another represents the first commercial application of our embedded process verification technology  and the third represents our entry into a new market solar cell manufacture 
in addition to these contracts for product initiatives  we revived our long term relationship with one of our major customers 
although we had previously been advised that assembleon intended to start transitioning away from our alignment products  in late summer  assembleon determined that it would continue to use our sensors on its next generation system 
we are starting to see signs of strengthening in the global electronics market 
manufacturers of smt assembly equipment  who did not place sensor orders in the first half of  have resumed ordering 
in addition  demand for stand alone se solder paste inspection and aoi systems is improving 
we believe that these improving market conditions  the efficiencies in operations we have implemented  and the new products we have introduced and anticipate introducing in  will lead to improved operating results over the coming year 
for the quarter ending march   we are forecasting near break even results on revenue of million  up from revenue of million in the quarter ending december  we are presently forecasting a return to full year profitability in 
table of contents segment results our business consists of two operating segments  the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments 
the electronic assembly segment designs  manufactures and sells optical process control sensors and inspection systems for the electronic assembly equipment market 
the semiconductor segment designs  manufactures and sells optical and other process control sensors and related equipment for the semiconductor capital equipment market 
segment information follows year ended december  in thousands revenue electronic assembly semiconductor total gross margin electronic assembly semiconductor total operating expense electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations interest income and other income loss before income taxes revenues our revenues decreased by to million in from million in and decreased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands electronic assembly oem sensors smt systems total electronic assembly semiconductor total electronic assembly the global recession caused severe weakness and disruption in our electronics markets starting late in and throughout all of  causing significant declines in revenue from both our oem alignment sensors and stand alone smt inspection systems products in both and when compared to the same period of the prior year 
revenue from sales of our oem alignment sensors decreased by million or in to million  down from million in and decreased by million or in  down from million in revenue from sales of our stand alone smt inspection systems products decreased by million or to million in  down from million in and decreased million or in  down from million in 
table of contents the decrease in sales of oem alignment sensors  which are primarily dependent on two significant customers  resulted from significantly reduced orders in late through most of  as these customers worked to sell their own inventories of assembly machines in a market where virtually no capital purchases were occurring 
these customers began to increase their orders in late  and have projected further increases in sales of our system products were impacted to a large extent by the same capital purchase issues 
sales of our se ultra and se solder paste inspection systems decreased by million or in to million and by million or in to million  after increasing million or in sales of our flex aoi systems decreased by million or in to million and remained virtually unchanged in at million when compared to we believe the introduction of our se solder paste inspection system in the second quarter of  combined with the planned introduction of our new aoi system  the qx and a new lower tier solder paste inspection system will strengthen our competitive position in the inspection market 
unlike revenue from our oem alignment sensors  which is closely tied to the need for added production capacity for printed circuit boards  a portion of our stand alone smt systems revenue is derived from the retro fit of existing production lines as companies seek to improve their production yields  thereby reducing manufacturing costs 
we believe that increased use of outsourcing for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes  increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards caused increased demand for our inspection equipment  prior to the recent global economic recession and will increase demand in the future as the recession eases and our markets strengthen 
however  our electronic assembly revenue has been  and will continue to be impacted by increasing competition and price pressure  particularly for stand alone smt inspection systems products sold in asia 
export revenue from oem alignment sensors and stand alone smt inspection systems totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising of our electronic assembly revenue in  of electronic assembly revenue in and of electronic assembly revenue in sales to international customers continue to be significant  as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china and other areas of asia 
semiconductor revenues from semiconductor products decreased by million or to million in down from million in and decreased by  or in from million in the decrease in revenue was due to the recession  difficult conditions in the market for semiconductor fabrication equipment and declining revenue from our older wafer mapper and frame grabber products 
total wafersense revenue decreased to million in after increasing to million in from million in our wafer mapper and frame grabber products are relatively mature 
we anticipate that future growth in our semiconductor revenues  exclusive of changes related to capital procurement cycles  will come from our new wafersense products  a family of wireless  wafer like precision measurement tools for in situ setup  calibration and process optimization in semiconductor processing equipment 
we have recently introduced several new additions to the wafersense product line  including additional leveling sensors  along with new gapping  teaching  vibration and particle sensors 
export revenue from semiconductor products totaled million or of total semiconductor revenue in  million or of total semiconductor revenue in and million or of total semiconductor revenue in the percentage of sales coming from international markets decreased in due to a large proportional decrease in sales of frame grabber products  which tend to generate significant international sales 
the percentage of semiconductor sales coming from international markets increased substantially in due to the large increase in wafersense sales  which have a higher concentration of international sales than our other semiconductor products 
in addition  sales of our wafer mapping products  which do not generate significant international sales  declined more in than our frame grabber products  which do generate significant international sales 
cost of revenue and gross margin electronic assembly gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales were in  in and in the reduction in gross margin percentage during and was due to significantly lower sales of higher margin oem alignment sensors  substantially lower production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs  continued competitive pricing pressure for our products  particularly older generation versions that are being replaced  and the overall impact of the global recession 

table of contents other factors having a negative impact on our gross margins in and included juki s transition to our next generation lnc sensor  which carries a lower gross margin than the older sensors we sell to juki and increasing price competition for our smt inspection systems products 
in addition  our gross margin in was negatively impacted by a  write down of excess and obsolete inventory resulting from our anticipated loss of assembleon as a significant customer for our oem alignment sensors  combined with a sharp drop off in demand at the end of resulting from the recession 
in  we sold most of the previously written down inventory to assembleon at a reduced price 
assembleon has since elected to continue to use our oem alignment sensors for its current and future pick and place platforms 
in response to significant weakness in our markets resulting from the global recession  and transition of manufacturing for our smt inspection systems products to singapore  we reduced our manufacturing workforce by over employees or by the end of the second quarter of in addition  by the end of the second quarter of  we completed consolidating our portland based semiconductor manufacturing into our minneapolis facility  a move that has further streamlined our cost structure 
these actions have reduced our overall manufacturing costs and have better leveraged our manufacturing operations  thereby favorably impacting our gross margins not only in the second half of  but also in future periods 
we compensate for pricing pressure by introducing new products with more features and improved performance and through manufacturing cost reduction programs 
for example  we believe our next generation se solder paste inspection system and qx aoi system combines a reduction in cost with enhanced performance 
other recently introduced products including our solar wafer alignment camera  embedded process verification epv technology and the embedded solder paste inspection solution we developed for dek  have more favorable margins than our existing products 

semiconductor gross margin as a percentage of semiconductor sales was in  compared to in and in gross margin as a percentage of semiconductor sales increased in due to the cost benefit from consolidation of manufacturing for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters 
gross margins decreased as a percentage of revenue in compared to due to a change in revenue mix  with our highest margin wafer mapping sensors representing a smaller percentage of total semiconductor revenue 
we expect gross margins as a percentage of revenue from our semiconductor products to continue to improve in gross margins in only reflect a partial year benefit from consolidation of manufacturing for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters facility 
gross margins in will benefit from the consolidation for the entire year 
operating expenses we believe continued investment in research and development of new products  coupled with continued investment in and development of our sales channel is critical to future growth and profitability 
we maintain research and development and sales and marketing expenses at relatively high levels  even during the recession and during periods of downturn in our electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets  as we continue to fund development of important new products  and continue to invest in our sales channels and develop new sales territories 
in february  we announced plans to move to singapore a significant portion of our systems related product development and manufacturing 
the transition of systems related product development to singapore was substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of and the transition of manufacturing for our system products was substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of the realignment of our systems related product development and manufacturing to singapore has resulted in lower costs and a more focused development effort 
in response to the significant weakness in our markets and the global economy  and also due to our transition of a significant portion of our operations to singapore  we reduced our workforce by employees or over in manufacturing and approximately in development  selling  general and administrative from the start of the fourth quarter of through the end of the second quarter of other cost saving measures implemented in include salary reductions and reduced spending for non labor costs such as travel  supplies and the like 
these cost saving measures  combined with savings from our transition to singapore  have provided significant annual expense savings 
implementation of the cost reduction actions discussed above had no impact on any of our strategic growth programs  work on our common hardware platforms for inspection  next generation inspection technologies  or pursuit of new oem contracts 
as a result of signs of an improving economy  we elected to restore salary levels for our employees to pre reduction levels in in addition  we anticipate that our costs will increase as business activity picks up and revenue returns to pre recession levels 
however  many of the cost savings measures that were put in place during and will continue to provide meaningful savings for the foreseeable future 

table of contents electronic assembly research and development expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to resulted from a more focused and efficient research and development effort due to transition of systems related research and development to singapore  as well as transition costs incurred in singapore transition costs classified as research and development expense in were  no transition costs were incurred in in addition  the cost reduction actions implemented in november and february contributed to the lower level of spending in the increase in research and development expense in compared to resulted from costs incurred to transition our systems related research and development to singapore 
throughout most of  we maintained our minneapolis based systems development team while we trained our new singapore based team  resulting in extra costs for wages  training  travel  and other costs  during the initial start up and training period 
singapore transition costs totaled million in of this amount  transition costs included in research and development expense totaled  selling  general and administrative expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in selling  general and administrative expenses for include an  provision for doubtful accounts related to a key distributor of our smt inspection systems products 
the distributor remains in business  and is committed to paying us the amount owed 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts was more than offset by reductions in expense from our cost savings measures  reductions in travel costs  lower commissions for third party sales representatives resulting from the lower level of smt inspection systems sales and lower foreign sales office expenses resulting from favorable foreign exchange rates 
the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to a  reduction in wage expense resulting from reduced incentive and stock compensation costs and a  reduction in commissions for third party sales representatives resulting from the lower level of system sales 
selling general and administrative expense in included approximately  of expense related to a canceled acquisition 
the savings from this non recurring activity were partially offset by additional expense related to our singapore transition 
semiconductor research and development expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the decline in research and development expenses in resulted from the cost reduction actions that were implemented in november and february  offset in part by a small increase in expense for abandoned patents 
research and development for our semiconductor products remain focused on our wafersense family of precision measurement tools  including new automated leveling  gapping  teaching  vibration and particle sensors to assist with process optimization and yield improvement in the semiconductor fabrication process 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to was due to lower salary and consulting costs  and lower sales commissions resulting from the reduced level of revenue 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to was due to a small workforce reduction which occurred early in  and lower costs for incentive compensation 
severance  recruitment and singapore transition we started to incur severance and recruitment costs in february in connection with our decision to move a significant portion of development and manufacturing for our systems products to singapore 
the transition of systems related product development was substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of  and the transition of systems related manufacturing was substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of severance costs incurred in in connection with the february decision to move our systems related development and manufacturing to singapore totaled we also incurred expenses totaling  in for outside service providers to assist us with recruitment of our new singapore based development and manufacturing team 
we maintained our minneapolis based systems development team while we trained our new singapore based team  resulting in extra costs totaling  for wages  training  travel  and other costs  during the initial start up and training period 
these costs have been classified in our statement of operations as research and development expense 
other start up costs totaling  have been classified in our statement of operations as selling  general and administrative expense 
costs in related to the move and transition to singapore were not significant 

table of contents additional severance costs of  were incurred in november when we reduced our workforce by approximately or employees in response to weak global economic conditions 
in february  we further reduced our workforce by positions in response to further weakening in the global economy  our transition to singapore and our decision to consolidate manufacturing for our semiconductor products in our minneapolis facility 
severance costs in related to the november and february workforce reductions totaled  all of the severance costs related to the february transition to singapore  and the november and february workforce reductions have been classified as severance and recruitment in our statement of operations 
a summary of our severance accruals follows electronic assembly semiconductor in thousands february singapore recruit ment november workforce reduction february workforce reduction total november workforce reduction february workforce reduction total total balance  january  cost incurred payments made balance  december  cost incurred payments made balance  december  goodwill impairment and amortization of intangibles we assess our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we measure for potential impairment of goodwill associated with each of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of and concluded that the goodwill related to our semiconductor segment in the amount of  was not impaired 
for  our annual impairment review coincided with a series of facts and circumstances indicating that our goodwill might be impaired  including weakness in the united states capital markets  caused by the deepening global recession  as well as our reduced level of profitability  causing a significant drop in our market capitalization 
upon completion of our analysis  we concluded that the goodwill related to our electronic assembly segment was fully impaired  resulting in a pre tax goodwill impairment charge in of million 

table of contents interest income and other interest income and other includes interest earned on investments  realized gains and losses from sales of investments  gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and in  an unrealized loss on an available for sale equity security 
interest income and other decreased in and compared to due to lower rates of interest earned on invested funds and lower invested balances of cash and marketable securities resulting from significant repurchases of our common stock in totaling million 
in  we recognized a  unrealized loss on an available for sale equity security 
the decline in market value for this security was determined to be other than temporary resulting in recognition of the unrealized loss in our statement of operations 
we also incurred foreign currency transaction losses  net of underlying currency hedges  of  in and  in income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in  reflecting an effective income tax rate of 
in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  reflecting an effective income tax rate of 
in  we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an effective income tax rate of 
our effective tax rate for was favorably impacted by or  from settlement of internal revenue service audits of our and federal income tax returns  including both the impact of settlement payments and reversal of a portion of our reserve for income taxes 
other items impacting our effective rate in include a small benefit from the research and experimentation r d tax credit  offset by higher tax expense in foreign tax jurisdictions with tax rates differing from the u 
s federal statutory rate 
our effective income tax rate for was negatively impacted by due to the non deductibility of a large portion of our goodwill impairment charge 
a reduction in our reserve for income tax exposures reduced our effective rate by approximately in we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
during  the internal revenue service completed audits of our and federal income tax returns 
our settlement with the internal revenue service did not have a material impact on our financial condition 
we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before due to the anticipated carry back of our federal taxable loss to and  the internal revenue service could potentially examine our federal income tax returns for those years 
the statute of limitations for examination of these returns had previously expired 
we expect to receive a federal income tax refund in of approximately million from carry back of our federal taxable loss 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals  research and development tax credit carry forwards and foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes  or when net operating loss carry forwards are applied against future taxable income  or when tax credit carry forwards are applied against future tax liabilities 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards 
significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods  our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in analyzing the need for valuation allowances  we first considered our history of cumulative losses for us income tax purposes over the past three years and also gave significant consideration to our results for us income tax purposes over the past five years  as the economic cycles in our industry have tended to average five years in length from peak to trough 
we also considered our forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives 
finally  we considered the length and severity of the recent global economic crisis  the impact that it had our operating results and our expectation for rebound given recent signs of recovery in the global economy and more specifically in our markets 
after considering all of these factors  and after considering other significant positive evidence  we concluded that a valuation allowance with respect to substantially all of our us based deferred tax assets was not required at december  
table of contents our results in both and were negatively impacted by the recent global economic slowdown  and we incurred a loss in the united states in both and  where most of our net deferred tax assets are recorded 
therefore  achievement of profitability in the united states will be a significant factor in determining our continuing ability to carry these deferred tax assets without recording a valuation allowance 
we are seeing signs of strengthening in the global electronics market 
manufacturers of smt assembly equipment  who did not place sensor orders in the first half of  have resumed ordering 
in addition  demand for se solder paste inspection and aoi systems is improving 
for the quarter ending march   we are forecasting near break even results on revenue of million  up from revenue of million in the quarter ending december   and we are forecasting a return to full year profitability in if future results from our operations are less than projected  a valuation allowance may be required against virtually all of our deferred tax assets  which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
deferred tax assets at december   include net operating loss carry forwards incurred in the uk by cyberoptics ltd  which was acquired in the utilization of these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on cyberoptics ltd 
s ability to generate sufficient uk taxable income during the carry forward period 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  during due to our use of million of cash to fund our net loss and other operating activities  purchases of capital assets of million  mostly offset by million of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities  net of purchases 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
combined balances of cash and marketable securities declined by million to million as of december  from million as of december  we used million of cash for operating activities in cash used for operations included our net loss of million  which included non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  gain and loss activity from marketable securities and stock compensation expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included increases in accounts receivable of million and income tax refunds receivable of  and decreases in accrued expenses of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included decreases in inventories of million and increases in accounts payable of  the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of income tax refunds receivable were higher due to anticipated income tax refunds resulting from our carry back of our taxable loss to earlier periods 
the decrease in accrued expenses resulted from lower levels of income tax reserves resulting from settlement of internal revenue service audits of our and federal income tax returns  lower warranty accruals resulting from the lower level of sales in and payment of accrued severance 
inventories were lower due to reduced material purchases in response to sharply lower sales levels early in and the increase in sales in the later half of the year 
accounts payable were higher due to the timing of inventory purchases and a conscious effort on our part to extend the timing of vendor payments 
we generated  of cash from operations in cash generated from operations included our net loss of million  which included a million non cash goodwill impairment charge and other non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  gain and loss activity from marketable securities and stock compensation expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities include a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventories of  and a decrease in current assets of  cash generated from the reduction in accounts receivable was mostly offset by an increase in income tax refunds receivable of million  a decrease in accounts payable of  and decreases in accrued expenses and advance customer payments of  the reduction in accounts receivable and inventory resulted from the significant and rapid decline in our sales during the later half of we recorded revenue of million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the fourth quarter of income tax refunds receivable reflects the anticipated tax refund we expect to receive from the carry back of our taxable loss to earlier years 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted from a reduction in new inventory purchases late in the year  in anticipation of the global economic recession and its impact on near term sales in the decrease in accrued expenses and advance customer payments primarily resulted from the elimination of incentive bonuses in given our financial performance 
we generated million of cash from investing activities in compared to generating million of cash from investing activities in changes in the level of investment in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases  sales and maturities of those securities generated million of cash in and million of cash in we used million of cash in and million of cash in for the purchase of fixed asset and capitalized patent costs 

table of contents financing activities provided  of cash in from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we used million of cash for financing activities in  mainly for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
stock option exercises and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan generated  of cash in at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
except for our obligations under facilities leases and purchase contracts  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  purchase commitments for inventory can vary based on the volume of revenue and resulting inventory requirements 
while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december  in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations reserve for income taxes total contractual cash obligations we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility built to our specifications in golden valley  minnesota  which functions as our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility 
the lease for this space is set to expire in june we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility in singapore 
the lease for this facility is set to expire in may purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed above 

table of contents fair value measurements we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities based on a three level fair value hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 
the next highest priority is based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets or other observable inputs level 
the lowest priority is given to unobservable inputs level 
the following table provides information regarding fair value measurements for our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  according to the three level fair value hierarchy fair value measurements at december  using in thousands balance december  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level cash equivalents us government and agency obligations corporate debt securities asset backed securities equity securities our foreign currency swap agreements are structured to mature on the last day of each quarter 
the fair value associated with these agreements is inconsequential and represents a level measurement 
related party transactions we did not engage in any related party transactions during the three year period ended december  inflation and foreign currency transactions changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
virtually all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had two open swap agreement that were purchased on that day 
as a result  any unrealized gains or losses as of december  were inconsequential 
during the year ended december   losses from the settlement of foreign currency swap agreements totaling  were partially offset by non cash transaction gains on the underlying inter company balances of  we have sales offices located in the uk  singapore  and china 
we do not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no the effective date for use of the fasb codification is for interim and annual periods ending after september  our adoption of the fasb codification had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued guidance codified in asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial condition  financial performance  and cash flows 
we adopted guidance included in asc on january  and included the appropriate disclosures in our financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asc no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures subsequent measurement  which discusses the provisions related to the determination of fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
based on the guidance in asc no 
 if an entity determines that the level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and that a transaction is not orderly  further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed  and a significant adjustment to the transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value 
the guidance in asc no 
is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  our adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asc no 
 transition related to recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which applies to investments in debt securities for which other than temporary impairments may be recorded 
if an entity s management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell a debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  then an entity may separate other than temporary impairments into two components the amount related to credit losses recorded in earnings  and all other amounts recorded in other comprehensive income

we adopted this guidance on june  with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 
this guidance was subsequent amended by asu  which eliminates the company s need to reference the date through which subsequent events were evaluated 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
on topic  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
the objective of accounting standard update no 
is to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
vendors often provide multiple products or services to their customers 
those deliverables often are provided at different points in time or over different time periods 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in subtopic for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments in this update establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments in this update also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
on topic  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
the objective of accounting standard update no 
is to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality from the scope of topic instead  arrangements containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality will fall within the scope of available revenue accounting guidance for non software products 

table of contents accounting standard updates no 
and can be applied on a prospective basis or in certain circumstances on a retrospective basis 
if prospective adoption is elected  it is to be applied to arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  earlier adoption is permitted 
if an entity elects early adoption on a prospective basis  and the period of adoption is not the beginning of the reporting entity s fiscal year  the requirements are applied retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year 
we anticipate adopting the provisions of accounting standard updates no 
and no 
in the first quarter of our adoption of these updates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from all customers  including distributors  is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  revenues are recognized upon shipment under fob shipping point terms  and include shipping and handling costs 
estimated returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale 
sales of some surface mount technology smt systems products may require customer acceptance due to performance or other acceptance criteria included in the terms of sale 
for these smt product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
when a sale involves multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each respective element in accordance with guidance codified in accounting standards codification asc topic accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
allocation of revenue to undelivered elements of the arrangement is based on fair value of the element being sold on a stand alone basis 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties is  at december  
table of contents reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of  valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill for each of our reporting units by estimating their fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology to determine a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our remaining goodwill was not impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill for impairment because facts and circumstances similar to those noted above indicated that the assets might be impaired  including weakness in the united states capital markets caused by the deepening global recession  and our reduced level of profitability  causing a significant drop in our market capitalization 
an impairment loss for our identifiable intangible and long lived assets would be recognized when future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset and eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount 
as of december   we projected our future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets and concluded that there was no impairment 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of our two reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying value step of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the summation of our reporting units fair values is compared and reconciled to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
in the situation where a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the measurement of the impairment step of the impairment test is calculated by determining the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 

table of contents in determining the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach  our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis uses forecasts over a year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we use our business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
the significant assumptions incorporated in these forecasts for the goodwill impairment tests include our expectations regarding revenue during the year period  a percent terminal growth rate and a discount rate for both our electronic assembly and semiconductor reporting units 
the selection of discount rates may have a significant impact on the determination of fair value 
however  an increase or decrease of one percent in the discount rate would have had no impact on the amount of impairment recorded in for purposes of our goodwill impairment test  we reconciled the fair value for each of our reporting units to our overall fair value 
the publicly traded market price of our common stock and a control premium of percent were used in our determination of fair value  which represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the company 
the control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 
while the control premium is a significant assumption in determining our overall fair value  it had a minimal impact on the determination of goodwill impairment in an increase in the assumed control premium by five percent to percent would have had no impact on the amount of impairment recorded in for our electronic assembly reporting unit 
our remaining goodwill at december  and in the amount of  relates to our semiconductor reporting unit 
our recent analyses indicate that this goodwill is not impaired 
however  our conclusion could change in the future  if our assumptions about future economic conditions  revenue growth or profitability change 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in the future 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not criteria codified in asc topic accounting for income taxes  under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals  research and development tax credit carry forwards and foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes  or when net operating loss carry forwards are applied against future taxable income  or when tax credit carry forwards are applied against future tax liabilities 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards 
significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods  our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in analyzing the need for valuation allowances  we first considered our history of cumulative losses for us income tax purposes over the past three years and also gave significant consideration to our cumulative results for us income tax purposes over the past five years  as the economic cycles in our industry have tended to average five years in length from peak to trough 
we also considered our forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives 
finally  we considered the length and severity of the recent global economic crisis  the impact that it had our operating results and our expectation for rebound given recent signs of recovery in the global economy and more specifically in our markets 
after considering all of these factors  and after considering other significant positive evidence  we concluded that a valuation allowance with respect to substantially all of our us based deferred tax assets was not required at december  
table of contents our results in both and were negatively impacted by the recent global economic slowdown  and we incurred a loss in the united states in both and  where most of our net deferred tax assets are recorded 
therefore  achievement of profitability in the united states will be a significant factor in determining our continuing ability to carry these deferred tax assets without recording a valuation allowance 
we are seeing signs of strengthening in the global electronics market 
manufacturers of smt assembly equipment  who did not place sensor orders in the first half of  have resumed ordering 
in addition  demand for se solder paste inspection and aoi systems is improving 
for the quarter ending march   we are forecasting near break even results on revenue of million  up from revenue of million in the quarter ending december   and we are forecasting a return to full year profitability in if future results from our operations are less than projected  a valuation allowance may be required against virtually all of our deferred tax assets  which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded
