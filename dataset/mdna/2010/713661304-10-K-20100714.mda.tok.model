item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended april  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing first in class monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and viral infections 
we are advancing our two phase ii oncology programs as well as our phase i hcv program 
our phase ii single arm trials in lung  breast  and brain cancers have demonstrated promising results compared to data from separate historical control trials  leading us to initiate two new randomized phase iib trials in non small cell lung cancer nsclc 
our pipeline of novel investigational product candidates includes bavituximab and cotara 
bavituximab is a first in class phosphatidylserine ps targeting monoclonal antibody that represents a new approach to treating cancer and has demonstrated broad spectrum potential in multiple solid tumors 
ps is a highly immunosuppressive molecule usually located inside the membrane of healthy cells  but flips and becomes exposed on the outside of cells that line tumor blood vessels  creating a specific target for anti cancer treatments 
ps targeting antibodies target and bind to ps and block this immunosuppressive signal  thereby enabling the immune system to recognize and fight the tumor 
recently  we initiated a new randomized phase iib trial evaluating bavituximab in combination with standard chemotherapy in patients with refractory nsclc  which represents a significant unmet medical need and fastest potential path to market 
we also recently initiated a randomized phase iib trial evaluating bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy in front line nsclc 
by the end of  we plan to initiate an additional company sponsored clinical trial 
in addition to these company sponsored trials  we have recently launched an investigator sponsored trials ist program as a cost effective way to generate insight into bavituximab s mechanism of action  augment our safety database  and evaluate new combination therapy ap proaches to treating cancer patients 
our novel brain cancer therapy cotara is a targeted monoclonal antibody linked to a radioisotope that is administered directly into the tumor  destroying the tumor from the inside out  with minimal exposure to healthy tissue 
cotara is currently in a phase ii safety and efficacy study designed to treat up to patients at first relapse and enrollment is over complete 
cotara has been granted orphan drug status and fast track designation for the treatment of gbm and anaplastic astrocytoma by the us food and drug administration 
in addition to our clinical programs  we are performing pre clinical research on bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections under a contract awarded through the tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
this government contract is expected to provide us with up to million in funding over an initial two year based period ending june  on june   we announced that the base period was extended by days or through august  to complete ongoing pre clinical studies and to determine potential next steps under the contract 
subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerati ons in future years  this contract can be extended by the tmti beyond the base period to cover up to million in funding over the five year contract period through three option terms up to one year per option period 
in addition to our research and development efforts  we operate a wholly owned cgmp current good manufacturing practices contract manufacturing subsidiary  avid bioservices avid 
avid provides integrated manufacturing services for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies on a fee for service basis  from pre clinical drug supplies up through commercial scale drug manufacturing 
in addition to generating revenue from providing a broad range of biomanufacturing services to third party clients  avid is strategically integrated with peregrine to manufacture clinical products for our clinical trials 
going concern our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern 
at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our prod ucts under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of equity  during fiscal year  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of april   gross proceeds of up to  remained available under an effective shelf registration statement 
subsequent to april  and through june  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of june   gross proceeds of up to  remained available under an effective shelf registration statement 
in addition  we may also raise additional capital through additional equity offerings  licensing our products in development  procuring additional government contracts and grants  or increasing revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  avid 
while we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that we will be successful in procuring additional government contracts and grants  or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  combined with the projected revenues from our government contract  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers and from our government contract to meet our obligations as they become due through at least the third quarter of our fiscal year ending january  based on current assumptions 
there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party or government contracts  technical challenges  or possible reductions in funding under our government contract  which could reduce or delay our future projected cash inflows 
in addition  under our loan agreement as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in the event our government contract with the tmti is terminated or canceled for any reason  including reasons pertai ning to budget cuts by the government or reduction in government funding for the program  we would be required to set aside cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal to of the outstanding loan balance or  as of april  in a restricted collateral account non accessible by us 
in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed or if we default on a loan covenant that limits our access to our available cash on hand  we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the third quarter of our fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
results of operations the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and this table provides an overview of the changes in the statement of operations for the comparative periods  which changes are further discussed below 
years ended april  years ended april  change change revenues contract manufacturing government contract revenue license revenue total revenues cost and expenses cost of contract manufacturing research and development selling  general and administrative total cost and expenses loss from operations other income expense interest and other income interest and other expense net loss contract manufacturing revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  contract manufacturing revenue for the year ended april  remained in line with the prior year increasing slightly by  or 
this increase in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to an increase in manufacturing services provided by avid to third party customers on a fee for service basis compared to the prior year 
we expect to continue to generate contract manufacturing revenue during fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of in process customer related projects and the anticipated demand for avid s services under signed contracts and outstanding proposals 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in contract manufacturing revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increases in both manufacturing and process development services provided by avid to third party customers on a fee for service basis including an increase in the number of completed manufacturing runs and the mix of completed manufacturing runs utilizing our larger capacity bioreactors compared to the year ended april  government contract revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  government contract revenue stems from our contract with the tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the purpose of the contract is to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
the increase in government contract revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to an increase in research and development services performed under the contract as pre clinical and manufacturing activities have increased compared to the prior year 
in addition  since the contract was signed on june   there was no corresponding revenue generated duri ng the initial two months of the prior fiscal year 
as of april   we have recognized  in total government contract revenue under this contract  of which we recognized  during fiscal year and  during fiscal year the contract is expected to provide us with up to million in funding over an initial month base period ending june  on june   we announced that the base period was extended by the tmti by days or through august  to complete ongoing pre clinical studies and to determine potential next steps under the contract 
subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations in future years  the contract can be extended by the tmti beyond the base period to cover up to million in fundi ng over the five year contract period through three option terms up to one year per option term 
in addition  subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations  the contract can be canceled by the tmti at any time 
due to the uncertainty regarding the extension of the contract beyond the base period  it is difficult for us to estimate if we are going to continue to recognize revenue under this contract beyond the extended base period 
in addition to our current government contract with the tmti  we are also actively applying for additional government contracts and grants to support our oncology and anti viral programs 
however  due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to successfully secure additional government contracts or grants  we cannot estimate with any certainty future government contract revenue in addition to our current government contract during fiscal year year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in government contract revenue of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was related to research and development services performed under our government contract with the dtra  a division of the department of defense 
the contract was signed on june  and therefore  there was no corresponding revenue in fiscal year cost of contract manufacturing year ended april  compared to the year ended april  cost of contract manufacturing for the year ended april  remained in line with the prior year decreasing slightly by  or 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was directly related to the increase contract manufacturing revenue related to the increase in manufacturing services 
we expect to continue to incur contract manufacturing costs during fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of customer projects under our current contract manufacturing agreements 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in cost of contract manufacturing of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was directly related to the fiscal year increase in contract manufacturing revenue 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was primarily due to an increase in contract manufacturing revenue combined with improved efficiencies in costs associated with contract manufacturing services and the mix of completed manufacturing runs from the utilization of our larger capacity bioreactors 
research and development expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to the following changes associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform ps targeting bavituximab tnt cotara other total r d expenses o ps targeting technology platform bavituximab the increase in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in r d expenses directly associated with our efforts to advance the development of bavituximab and a fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections under our government contract with the tmti as pre clinical and manufacturing activities performed under the contract have increased compared to the prior year 
the increase in ps targeting program expenses was further supplemented with an increase in clinical trial and related expenses to support the advancement of our bavituximab clinical program 
during the current year  we completed patient enrollme nt in one phase i and three phase ii clinical trials using bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors 
in addition  based on positive signs of activity from these phase ii studies  we began to incur expenses during fiscal year associated with initiating larger multi center phase iib trials during fiscal year this initial ground work included the submission of two separate phase iib clinical protocols using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of refractory and front line nsclc patients 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt technology platform cotara the decrease in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in clinical trial expenses associated with the timing of patient enrollment in our two cotara clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer  one of which completed patient enrollment during december the decrease in tnt program expenses was further supplemented by a decrease in our in house tnt development efforts as our in house development efforts were focused primarily on our ps targeting program 
o other r d programs the increase in our other r d program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in r d expenses associated with increased development efforts associated with the advancement of our r antibody that was subsequently licensed to a unaffiliated entity in july based on our current projections  which includes estimated clinical trial enrollment rates that are always uncertain  we expect research and development expenses in fiscal year to increase in comparison to fiscal year as we expect to continue the advancement of our bavituximab and cotara clinical programs  which includes the initiation of two separate phase iib trials evaluating bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of refractory and front line nsclc patients 
in addition  we expect to continue the advancement of bavituximab through our new investigator sponsored trial ist program as cost effective method to gain valuable information on bavituximab  augmenting its safety database  providing insights into mec hanisms of action  and facilitating the evaluation of new indications and therapeutic combinations 
during fiscal year  we expect to continue to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our ps targeting technology platform 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in r d expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to the following changes associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform ps targeting bavituximab tnt cotara other total r d expenses o ps targeting technology platform bavituximab the increase in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses to support the advancement of four clinical trials using bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors and one clinical trial for the treatment of hcv patients co infected with hiv 
patient enrollment for all three of our phase ii studies using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy advanced to the second stage of our two stage phase ii study designs during fiscal year the increase in ps targeting program expenses was further supplemented with an increase in r d expenses directly associated with increased efforts to advance the development of bavituximab and a fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections under our government contract with the tmti  which was awarded to us on june  o tumor necrosis therapy tnt cotara the increase in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increases in clinical trial and payroll expenses to support the continued advancement of our two ongoing cotara clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer 
o other r d programs the decrease in other r d program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to our efforts to significantly curtail our development expenses associated with our vascular targeting agents  anti angiogenesis agents  and vasopermeation enhancements agents programs while focusing our efforts on seeking partners to further advance these technologies 
during fiscal year  our rights to the vasopermeation enhancements agents technology expired under the terms of the license agreement 
looking beyond the next twelve months  it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of our technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with pre clinical and clinical trial development 
these unknown variables and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results  the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical trial  the uncertainty of the us food and drug administration allowing our studies to move forward from phase i clinical studies to phase ii and phase iii clinical studies  the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study 
any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates  the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements  the uncertainty of receiving future economic benefit from prepaid research and development services to third parties  the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies  which may increase or decrease our future costs  and the uncertainty of our ability to raise additional capital to support our future research and development efforts beyond the third quarter of our fiscal year ending january  we  or our potential partners  will need to do additional development and clinical testing prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates as all of our products are in discovery  pre clinical or clinical development 
testing  manufacturing  commercialization  advertising  promotion  exporting  and marketing  among other things  of our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort  and financial resources  and we cannot guarantee that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffe red significant setbacks in conducting advanced human clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
furthermore  the us food and drug administration may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
accordingly  we or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  director fees  legal and accounting fees  share based compensation expense  investor and public relation fees  insurance  and other expenses relating to the general management  administration  and business development activities of the company 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in payroll and related expense and share based compensation expense offset by a decrease in corporate legal fees 
our current year increase in payroll and related expenses of  was primarily the result of an increase in headcount and related compensation  consulting  and recruiting expenses associated with the increase sg a activities  including non cash share based compensation expense of  associated with the amortization of the fair value of options and performance based restricted stock awards granted to employees during february 
we also incurred incremental increases in other general corporate related expenses primarily associated with travel and related expenses  audit and accounting fees  and facility related expenses 
these increases in sg a expenses were offset with a current year decrease in corporate legal fees of  which was primarily due to legal fees incurred in the prior year associated with the settlement of a lawsuit regarding an out licensing agreement related to our tnt technology 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the slight decline in sg a expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to our efforts to curtail discretionary expenses 
the decrease in discretionary expenses were offset by an increase in corporate legal fees associated with the settlement of a lawsuit regarding an out licensing agreement related to our tnt technology offset by an overall decrease in other general corporate matters 
interest and other income year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april   compared to the prior year was primarily due to a  decrease in interest income as a result of lower prevailing interest rates during the current year compared to the prior year 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an  decrease in interest income as a result of a lower average cash balance on hand combined with lower prevailing interest rates during fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest and other expense year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other expense of  during the year ended april  compared to prior year was primarily due to a  increase in interest expense associated with the  term loan we entered into during the prior year combined with a  increase in non cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the fair value of detachable warrants and related debt issuance costs 
since the term loan was entered into during december  there were no corresponding interest or non cash interest amounts reported during the first two fiscal quarters in the prior year 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other expense of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to a  increase in interest expense associated with the  term loan we entered into during december combined with a  increase in non cash interest expense associated with the amortization of the fair value of detachable warrants and related debt issuance costs 
critical accounting policies the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires us to establish policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
in our judgment  our critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of a ssets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we currently derive revenue from the following three sources i contract manufacturing services provided by avid  ii licensing revenues related to agreements associated with peregrine s technologies under development  and iii government contract revenues for services provided under a government contract awarded to peregrine through the tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or passage of title has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we also follow the authoritative guidance when reporting revenue as gross when we act as a principal versus reporting revenue as net when we act as an agent 
for transactions in which we act as a principal  have discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform a substantive part of the services  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed to a customer and costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of cost of sales for contract manufacturing services and research and development expense for services provided under our contract with the tmti 
contract manufacturing revenue revenue associated with contract manufacturing services provided by avid are recognized once the service has been rendered and or upon shipment or passage of title of the product to the customer 
on occasion  we recognize revenue on a bill and hold basis in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under bill and hold arrangements  revenue is recognized once the product is complete and ready for shipment  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  management receives a written request from the customer for bill and hold treatment  the product is segregated from other inventory  and no further performance o bligations exist 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also record a provision for estimated contract losses  if any  in the period in which they are determined 
license revenue revenue associated with licensing agreements primarily consist of non refundable upfront license fees  non refundable annual license fees and milestone payments 
non refundable upfront license fees received under license agreements  whereby continued performance or future obligations are considered inconsequential to the relevant license technology  are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the technology 
if a license agreement has multiple element arrangements  we analyze and determine whether the deliverables  which often include performance obligations  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under multiple element arrangements  we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations ca n be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have stand alone value or have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
if we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue recognized under licensing agreements is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line method  as of the period ending date 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
non refundable annual license fees are recognized as revenue on the anniversary date of the agreement in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone  provided that i the milestone event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the fees are non refundable  and iii there is no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
government contract revenue on june   we were awarded up to a five year government contract the government contract potentially worth up to million to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
the contract was awarded through the tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
this government contract is expected to provide us with up to million in funding over an initial two year base period ending june  on june   we announced that the base period was extended by days or through august  to complete ongoing pre clinical studies and to determine potential next steps under the government contract 
subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations in future years  the contract can be extended by the tmti beyond the base period to cover up to million in funding over the five year contract period through three option terms of up to one year per option term 
the government contract is classified as a cost plus fixed fee contract 
we recognize government contract revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including the authoritative guidance specific to federal government contracts 
reimbursable costs under the contract primarily include direct labor  subcontract costs  materials  equipment  travel  and indirect costs 
in addition  we receive a fixed fee for our efforts equal to of the reimbursable costs incurred under the government contract  which is unconditionally earned as allowable costs are billed and is not contingent on success factors 
reimbursable costs under this government contract  including the fixed fee  are gen erally recognized as revenue in the period the reimbursable costs are incurred and become billable 
however  when amounts billable  including the fixed fee  are not reasonably related to the proportionate performance of the total work or services to be performed  we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis 
in addition  reimbursable costs  including the fixed fee  associated with manufacturing services are recognized as revenue once delivery or passage of title has occurred 
amounts billable including the fixed fee prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria are classified as deferred government contract revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense we account for stock options and awards granted under our equity compensation plans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the estimated fair value of share based payments to employees in exchange for services is measured at the grant date  using a fair value based method  and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the share based payment that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
share based compensation expense for a share based payment with a performance condition is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period whe n the achievement of the performance condition is determined to be probable 
if a performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met  no share based compensation is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
these model inputs include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise activity  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected volatility is based on the daily historical volatility of our stock covering the estimated expected term 
the expected term of options granted reflects actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasu ry notes with terms within the contractual life of the option at the time of grant 
the expected dividend yield assumption is based on our expectation of future dividend payouts 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
in addition  guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there are a number of factors that affect the amount of share based compensation expense  including the number of employee options granted during subsequent fiscal years  the price of our common stock on the date of grant  the volatility of our stock price  the estimate of the expected life of options granted and the risk free interest rates 
in addition  we periodically grant stock options and awards to non employee consultants  which we account for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the cost of non employee services received in exchange for share based awards are measured based on either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the share based award issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
in addition  guidance requires share based compensation related to unvested options and awards issued to non employees to be recalculated at the end of each reporting period based upon the fair market value on that date until the share based award has vested  and any adjustment to share based compensation resulting from the rem easurement is recognized in the current period 
research and development research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred in accordance with the authoritative guidance for research and development costs 
research and development expenses primarily include i payroll and related costs associated with research and development personnel  ii costs related to clinical and pre clinical testing of our technologies under development  iii costs to develop and manufacture the product candidates  including raw materials and supplies  product testing  depreciation  and facility related expenses  iv expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories  including sponsored research funding  and v other research and development expenses 
advance payments  including non refundable amounts  to secure the receipt of future research and development services are deferred and capitalized 
these pre payments are recognized as an expense in the period that the services are performed 
we assess our prepaid research and development expenses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the prepaid expense may not be recoverable or provide future economic benefit 
in addition  we record research and development expenses based on accruals associated with work performed in connection with advancing our clinical trials  which relies on estimates and or representations from clinical research organizations cros  hospitals  consultants  and other clinical trial related vendors 
we maintain regular communication with our vendors  including our cro vendors  and gauge the reasonableness of estimates provided 
however  actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
there were no material adjustments for a change in estimate to research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated financia l statements in any of the three years ended april  fair value measurements we determine fair value measurements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures for all assets and liabilities within the scope of this guidance 
this guidance clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
the guidance also clarifies its application in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the guidance prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as assets or liabilities whose value are based on quoted market prices in markets where trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
as of april   we do not have any level or level financial assets or liabilities and our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical securities level input 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our prod ucts under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of equity  during fiscal year  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of april   gross proceeds of up to  remained available under an effective shelf registration statement 
subsequent to april  and through june  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of june   gross proceeds of up to  remained available under an effective shelf registration statement 
in addition  we may also raise additional capital through additional equity offerings  licensing our products in development  procuring additional government contracts and grants  or increasing revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  avid 
while we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that we will be successful in procuring additional government contracts and grants  or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  combined with the projected revenues from our government contract  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers and from our government contract to meet our obligations as they become due through at least the third quarter of our fiscal year ending january  based on current assumptions 
there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party or government contracts  technical challenges  or possible reductions in funding under our government contract  which could reduce or delay our future projected cash inflows 
in addition  under our loan agreement as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in the event our government contract with the tmti is terminated or canceled for any reason  including reasons pertai ning to budget cuts by the government or reduction in government funding for the program  we would be required to set aside cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal to of the outstanding loan balance or  as of april  in a restricted collateral account non accessible by us 
in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed or if we default on a loan covenant that limits our access to our available cash on hand  we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the third quarter of our fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
significant components of the changes in cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the year ended april  compared to the prior year are as follows cash used in operating activities 
cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by changes in our net loss 
however  cash used in operating activities generally differs from our reported net loss as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during the year ended april   cash used in operating activities increased  to  compared to  for the year ended april  this increase in net cash used in operating activities was due to a net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities in the aggregate amount of  offset by a decrease of  in net loss reported during fiscal year after taking into consideration non cash operating expenses 
the increase in the net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities was primarily due to net changes associated with receivables  inventories  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  deferred revenue and deferred contract manufacturing revenue 
the decrease in our fiscal year net loss was primarily due to a current year increase in government contract revenue of offset by increases in research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the changes in operating activities as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities are as follows year ended april  net loss  as reported less non cash operating expenses depreciation and amortization share based compensation amortization of expenses paid in shares of common stock amortization of discount on notes payable and debt issuance costs loss on disposal of property net cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities net change in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  during the year ended april  this increase was due to an increase in property acquisitions of  combined with an  increase in other assets associated with an increase in deposits and or progress payments for certain laboratory equipment 
these increases in cash used in investing activities were offset with proceeds of  from the sale of property 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash provided of  for the year ended april  during fiscal year  we received net proceeds under two separate at market issuance sales agreements  whereby we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of  this amount was supplemented with net proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  these current year net proceeds were offset with aggregate principal payments on notes pa yable and capital leases of  during fiscal year  we received net proceeds of  from notes payable under a loan and security agreement we entered into in december in addition  during fiscal year  we received proceeds under an at market issuance sales agreement whereby we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of  these prior year net proceeds were offset with principal payments on capital leases of  contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of april   aggregated by type payments due by period total year years years after years operating leases  net note payable obligation capital lease obligation other long term liabilities minimum license obligations total contractual obligations represents our i facility operating lease in tustin  california under a non cancelable lease agreement  ii facility operating lease in houston  texas  which has a three year lease term and expires in february  and iii various office equipment leases  which generally have three year lease terms 
amounts represent anticipated principal and interest payments on our security and loan agreement 
under the security and loan agreement  the outstanding principal balance each month will bear interest at a monthly variable rate equal to the then current thirty day libor rate set at a floor of plus 
anticipated interest payments were calculated using an interest rate of representing a libor floor rate of plus 
as of april   the thirty day libor rate was less than the minimum floor 
represents capital lease agreements to finance certain equipment 
amounts include principal and interest 
represents licensing agreements we periodically enter into with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay future milestone payments based on product development success 
we do not anticipate making any milestone payments under any of our licensing agreements for at least the next fiscal year 
in addition  milestone payments beyond fiscal year cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results and development milestones and therefore  cannot be reasonably predicted or estimated at the present time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in us interest rates would affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our outstanding notes payable  however  they would not have an effect on our capital leases  which have fixed interest rates and terms 
based on our overall cash and cash equivalents interest rate exposure at april   a near term change in interest rates  based on historical movements  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
at april   we had an outstanding notes payable balance of  under a loan and security agreement  which bear interest at a monthly variable rate equal to the then current thirty day libor rate set at a floor of plus  which may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
however  based on current libor interest rates  which are currently under the minimum floor set at under our loan and security agreement and based on historical movements in libor rates  we believe a near term change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
