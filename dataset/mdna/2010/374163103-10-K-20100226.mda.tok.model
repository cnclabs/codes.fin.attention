item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this annual report 
geron is developing first in class biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer and chronic degenerative diseases  including spinal cord injury  heart failure and diabetes 
the company is advancing an anti cancer drug and a cancer vaccine that target the enzyme telomerase through multiple clinical trials in different cancers 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license have been delivered and over the term of the agreement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize milestone payments  which are subject to substantive contingencies  upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process  according to contract terms 
royalties are generally recognized as revenue upon the receipt of the related royalty payment 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs for services are rendered 
we recognize related party revenue under collaborative agreements as the related party research and development costs for services are rendered and when the source of funds have not been derived from our contributions to the related party 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which have not been earned 
when payments are received in equity securities  we do not recognize any revenue unless such securities are determined to be realizable in cash 
we estimate the projected future term of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on contractual terms  historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated terms of these license agreements have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future terms of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions to the currently active agreements in the future 
valuation of stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
option pricing model assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term impact the fair value estimate 
further  the estimated forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation recognized during the period 
the fair value of stock based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the awards using a straight line method 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on geron stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in deriving this assumption  we reviewed actual historical exercise and cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled 
the expected term of employees purchase rights  under our espp  is equal to the purchase period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
forfeiture rate was estimated based on historical experience and will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimate 
we annually evaluate the assumptions used in estimating fair values of our stock based awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data 
we have not revised the method in which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of our stock based awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the stock based compensation expense that we record for awards to employees and directors may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
non cash compensation expense recognized for stock based awards to employees and directors was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   total non cash compensation cost related to unvested stock based awards not yet recognized was million  net of estimated forfeitures  which is expected to be recognized over the next months on a weighted average basis 
for our non employee stock based awards  the measurement date on which the fair value of the stock based award is calculated is equal to the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete 
we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense of  zero and million for the fair value of the vested portion of non employee options  restricted stock awards and warrants in our consolidated statements of operations for  and  respectively 
fair value of financial instruments we categorize assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value 
the categories are as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
an active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level inputs other than quoted market prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
a financial instrument s categorization is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet  including the category for such instruments 
we classify inputs to derive fair values for marketable debt securities available for sale and marketable investments in licensees as level and instruments classified as level include us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities  money market funds and publicly traded equity securities in active markets  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  instruments classified as level include corporate notes  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  the price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources 
periodically  we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes 
historically  we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio manager s prices 
warrants to purchase common stock and non employee options are normally traded less actively  have trade activity that is one way  and or traded in less developed markets and are therefore valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters  resulting in level categorization 
the fair value for these instruments is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model s inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction 
inputs to the model include stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the derivatives and risk free interest rates 
see the following discussion  fair value of derivatives  for information on derivation of inputs to the model 
changes to the model s inputs are not changes to valuation methodologies  but instead reflect direct or indirect impacts from changes in market conditions 
accordingly  results from the valuation model in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
instruments classified as level include derivative liabilities  representing all of total financial liabilities measured at fair value as of december  for a further discussion regarding fair value measurements  see note on fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value of derivatives for warrants and non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  the fair value of these instruments is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at inception of such classification and marked to fair value at each financial reporting date 
the change in fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as an unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives 
the warrants and non employee options continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require this treatment  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
for warrants and non employee options classified as permanent equity  the fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in stockholders equity and no further adjustments are made 
fair value of warrants and non employee options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions regarding stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the warrants and non employee options and risk free interest rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock 
the expected term of warrants and non employee options represent the remaining contractual term of the instruments 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the remaining term of the instrument 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the fair value of these warrants and non employee options reflected as of each balance sheet date and the resulting change in fair value that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous periods 
as of december   we have not revised the method in which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of warrants and non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  and we do not expect revisions in the future 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future  based upon the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of preclinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product candidate to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized  of revenues from collaborative agreements in compared to  in and  in revenues in primarily reflected revenue recognized under our collaboration with ge healthcare  ltd 
ge healthcare 
revenues in and primarily reflected related party reimbursements we received from our joint venture in hong kong  ta therapeutics  ltd 
tat  for scientific research services and revenue recognized under our collaboration with corning life sciences 
since june   we have been including tat s results in our consolidated financial statements and have eliminated any related party revenue when the source of funds has been derived from our contributions to the related party 
prior to that date  related party revenue earned under the contract to perform scientific research services for tat was recognized as revenue as the services were performed 
we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future sales  or any combination thereof 
we recognized license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to our various agreements 
license fee revenue in primarily reflected revenue recognized from upfront license fee payments under our collaboration with ge healthcare 
license fee revenue in primarily reflected the receipt of a million milestone payment from exeter life sciences  inc as a result of the final risk assessment released by the us food and drug administration fda addressing food products made from cloned animals or their progeny 
license fee revenue in primarily reflected the receipt of million in milestone payments in connection with the collaboration and license agreement with merck co  inc merck 
we expect to recognize revenue of  in and  in related to our existing deferred revenue 
current revenues may not be predictive of future revenues 
we recognized royalty revenues of   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research use only market  telomerase based research products and agricultural products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of higher personnel related costs of million in connection with additional clinical operations personnel and increased clinical trial costs of  as a result of increased patient enrollment for imetelstat and grnvac trials 
the decrease in compared to was primarily the net result of decreased manufacturing costs of million as a result of timing of drug purchases for imetelstat and lower scientific supplies of million  partially offset by increased clinical trial costs of million associated with imetelstat and grnvac overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase as we incur expenses related to clinical trials for imetelstat along with continued development of our human embryonic stem cell hesc programs 
our research and development activities have arisen from our two major technology platforms  telomerase and hescs 
the oncology programs focus on treating or diagnosing cancer by targeting or detecting the presence of telomerase  either inhibiting activity of the telomerase enzyme  diagnosing cancer by detecting the presence of telomerase  or using telomerase as a target for therapeutic vaccines 
our core knowledge base in telomerase and telomere biology supports all these approaches  and our scientists may contribute to any or all of these programs in a given period 
the following table briefly describes our cancer therapeutic product candidates and their stage of development patient product development enrollment product description application stage status imetelstat telomerase chronic lymphoproliferative phase i trial completed grnl inhibitor diseases single agent imetelstat telomerase solid tumors phase i trial open grnl inhibitor single agent imetelstat telomerase multiple myeloma phase i trial completed grnl inhibitor single agent imetelstat telomerase non small cell lung phase i trial completed grnl inhibitor cancer combination imetelstat telomerase breast cancer phase i ii trial open grnl inhibitor combination imetelstat telomerase multiple myeloma phase i trial completed grnl inhibitor combination grnvac telomerase acute myelogenous phase ii trial completed cancer vaccine leukemia aml initiation of phase ii clinical trials in multiple myeloma  non small cell lung cancer  breast cancer and essential thrombocythemia is planned for interim data from the phase i single agent trial in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma has shown that imetelstat inhibits telomerase both in the bulk myeloma fraction as well as the stem cell containing fraction in patients bone marrow 
interim data from the trial in patients with refractory  advanced solid cancers has shown that with a modified dosing schedule  the exposures to imetelstat exceeded the levels associated with inhibiting tumor growth from several models of human cancers 
from the above trials  we have obtained data to assess the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of imetelstat 
with this information  we have established the single agent phase ii dose and dosing schedule and are planning to advance imetelstat to phase ii clinical trials in four different malignancies in taking the results from the duke university clinical studies in prostate cancer  hematologic malignancies and renal cell carcinoma  we optimized the vaccine manufacturing process and transferred it to a contract manufacturer 
we are conducting a phase ii clinical trial of our telomerase vaccine using the prime boost vaccination protocol in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in complete clinical remission 
twenty patients in the study have received vaccination with grnvac recent data from the trial showed that grnvac was safe and generally well tolerated over multiple vaccinations 
of the patients in the study  remain in complete clinical remission 
positive overall immune responses were detected in out of patients 
no correlation has been made between positive immune response and patient remission status 
continued follow up of patients for an additional nine months is required to estimate the impact of vaccination on disease free survival 
our hesc therapy programs focus on treating injuries and degenerative diseases with cell therapies based on cells derived from hescs 
a core of knowledge of hesc biology  as well as a significant continuing effort in deriving  growing  maintaining  and differentiating hescs  underlies all aspects of this group of programs 
many of our researchers are allocated to more than one hesc program  and the percentage allocations of time change as the resource needs of individual programs vary 
in our hesc therapy programs  we have concentrated our resources on several specific cell types  including grnopc  hesc derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells  for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury  grncm  hesc derived cardiomyocytes  for toxicology drug testing and the treatment of myocardial disease  grnic  hesc derived pancreatic islet cells for the treatment of diabetes  hesc derived chondrocytes for the treatment of osteoarthritis  hesc derived hepatocytes for adme drug testing  hesc derived dendritic cells for cancer immunotherapy and to prevent immune rejection of the other cell types used in therapeutic applications  and hesc derived osteoblasts for the treatment of osteoporosis 
we have developed proprietary methods to grow  maintain  and scale the culture of undifferentiated hescs that use feeder cell free and serum free media with chemically defined components 
we have also developed scalable processes to differentiate these cells into therapeutically relevant cells 
currently  the human clinical trial of grnopc  our hesc derived therapy targeted for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury  has been placed on clinical hold by the fda 
we are in discussions with the agency to answer its questions and proceed with the clinical trial 
research and development expenses incurred under each of these programs are as follows in thousands year ended december  oncology    hesc therapies    total    at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to commercialize products from the programs currently in progress 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug ind application 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are incurred in phase iii trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda or biologics license application bla must be filed with the fda  which includes  among other things  very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda bla must be reviewed and approved by the fda 
according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our potential products is highly uncertain 
actual timelines and costs to develop and commercialize a product are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda bla submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we cannot provide assurance that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the sub section titled delays in the commencement of clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenues and obtaining regulatory approvals to market our product candidates in the united states and other countries is a costly and lengthy process and we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our product candidates in part i  item a entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily due to reduced legal costs associated with our patents and lower audit fees and consulting costs 
the increase in from was primarily due to increased compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees  partially offset by reduced consulting expense and lower audit fees 
unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives reflects a non cash adjustment for changes in fair value of warrants to purchase common stock and options held by non employees that are classified as current liabilities 
derivatives classified as assets or liabilities are marked to fair value at each financial reporting date with any resulting unrealized gain loss recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the derivatives continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require them to be recorded as assets or liabilities  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
we incurred unrealized gains of   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
unrealized gains in and were due to the reduced fair values of derivatives resulting from shortening of their contractual terms  decreases in the market value of our stock and changes in other inputs factored into the estimate of their fair value such as the volatility of our stock 
unrealized gains for were primarily the result of amendments executed in march to certain warrant agreements to address the presumption of net cash settlement in the event that registered shares were not available to settle the warrants enabling reclassification of the decreasing fair value of those warrants from current liabilities to stockholders equity 
see note on fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the fair value of derivatives 
interest and other income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased interest rates 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased interest rates and lower cash and investment balances 
interest earned in future periods will depend on the size of our securities portfolio and prevailing interest rates 
in  net realized losses of  and in  net realized gains of  from sales of investments in licensees have been included in interest and other income 
no sales of investments in licensees occurred in also included in interest and other income for the years ended december   and  were recognized losses of zero   and  respectively  related to other than temporary declines in fair value of our investments in licensees 
losses recognized under equity method investment in august  we exchanged our equity interest in the start licensing  inc start joint venture for equity interest in viagen  inc viagen 
in september  we provided a loan of million to viagen in connection with viagen s acquisition of an interest in an unrelated company 
the proceeds of the loan did not fund prior viagen losses and represented additional financial support to viagen 
in september  we provided million as a new equity investment in viagen and also received million from viagen in repayment of our loan  resulting in a net investment of million 
the new investment in did not fund prior viagen losses and represented additional financial support to viagen 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we recognized losses of million and  for and  respectively  for our proportionate share of viagen s losses since providing the loan in september previously  we had suspended the equity method of accounting for start and viagen since our proportionate share of net losses exceeded the value of our investment and we had no commitments to provide financial support to either company 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  and  interest and other expense was primarily comprised of bank charges 
the increase in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to higher bank charges 
the decrease in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to reduced bank charges as a result of lower cash and investment balances 
deemed dividend on derivatives in april  we modified the terms of certain outstanding warrants held by an investor by extending the exercise term and  for certain of these warrants  reducing the exercise price 
in connection with the modifications  we recognized a deemed dividend of approximately  in the consolidated statements of operations for the incremental fair value of the modified warrants  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model as of the modification date 
in exchange for the exercise of warrants in february  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  at a premium  exercisable from june the new warrants were substantially the same as the a warrants issued in connection with a financing in december the aggregate fair value of million for these new instruments  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  was recognized as a deemed dividend in the consolidated statements of operations 
in december  we modified the terms of certain outstanding warrants by extending the exercise term and reducing the exercise price 
the exercise term of the a warrants to purchase  shares of common stock was extended to november and the exercise price was modified to per share 
the exercise terms of the a warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and d warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were extended to december and the exercise prices were modified to per share 
in connection with the modifications  we received million in cash consideration from the institutional investors holding the outstanding warrants 
we recognized a deemed dividend of million in the consolidated statements of operations for the incremental fair value of the modified warrants  as estimated using the black scholes option pricing model as of the modification date  net of the cash consideration received from the institutional investors for the modifications 
net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss applicable to common stockholders was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall net loss for increased compared to primarily due to decreased interest income  reduced revenues from milestones  increased research and development expenses and increased losses recognized for an equity method investment 
overall net loss for increased compared to primarily due to reduced revenues from milestones  lower interest income and decreased unrealized gains on derivatives 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  us government and agency securities  corporate notes  commercial paper  asset backed securities and municipal securities 
our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub prime mortgages  collateralized debt obligations or auction rate securities and we have not to date recognized an other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity 
to date  we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents  however  we cannot provide assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the net result of the receipt of million in net proceeds in february from an underwritten public offering of our common stock partially offset by use of cash for operations 
the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was due to use of cash for operations 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facility will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least december however  our future capital requirements will be substantial 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time 
factors that may require us to use our available capital resources sooner than we anticipate include continued clinical development of our product candidates  imetelstat  grnvac and grnopc  our ability to meaningfully reduce manufacturing costs of current product candidates  future clinical trial results  progress of product and preclinical development of our other product candidates  such as grncm  grnic and grnchnd  cost and timing of regulatory approvals  and filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used for operations in compared to was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses associated with our clinical operations and reduced interest income 
the increase in net cash used for operations in compared to was primarily the result of reduced interest income  payments to biotechnology research corporation  our joint venture partner in ta therapeutics  ltd 
for scientific research services and increased clinical trial expenses 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for net cash provided by investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in compared to primarily reflected increased marketable securities purchases 
the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in compared to primarily reflected reduced maturities of marketable securities 
for the three years ended december   we have purchased approximately million in property and equipment  net of disposals  none of which was financed through equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   no payments were due under our equipment financing facility 
as of december   we had approximately  available for borrowing under our equipment financing facility 
we intend to renew the commitment for a new equipment financing facility in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  we will use our cash resources for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in and was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in was  net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses and receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of geron common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share to certain institutional investors 
net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflected the repurchase of vested stock from certain employees to provide funds for minimum payroll tax withholding requirements 
net cash provided by financing activities in included million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to institutional investors in connection with a financing in december and million in cash consideration from the modification of certain outstanding warrants in december contractual obligations as of december  our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter were as follows principal payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands equipment lease operating leases research funding  total contractual cash obligations  this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
in addition  this table does not include payments under our severance plan if there were a change in control of the company or severance payments to key employees under involuntary termination 
in march  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at and constitution drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from august  through july  in may  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at commonwealth drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from may  through april  the fair value of the common stock issuances has been recorded as a prepaid asset and is being amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease periods 
future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases are zero through july   as a result of the prepayments of rent with our common stock 
research funding is comprised of sponsored research commitments at various laboratories around the world

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with six financial institutions in the united states 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of marketable securities 
marketable securities currently consist of us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities and corporate notes 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
we limit our credit and liquidity risks through our investment policy and through regular reviews of our portfolio against our policy 
to date  we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts or to our cash equivalents and marketable securities in our investment portfolios 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in widely diversified investments consisting of both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million of long term investments which are due in one to two years 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities  corporate notes and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our wholly owned international subsidiary  geron bio med ltd  satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
as of december   there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
