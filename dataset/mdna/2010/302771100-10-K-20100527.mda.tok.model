item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and item a  risk factors 

table of contents seasonality our operations are seasonal in nature 
tobacco in brazil is usually purchased from january through july  while buying in malawi  mozambique  and other african countries typically begins around april and continues through late fall 
farmers begin to sell us flue cured tobacco in late july  and the marketing season lasts for approximately four months 
us burley tobacco farmers deliver their crop from mid november through mid february 
these overlapping marketing periods tend to mitigate the overall effects of seasonality on our financial performance in most fiscal years 
we normally operate each of our processing plants for seven to nine months of the year 
during this period for each region  inventories of green tobacco  inventories of processed tobacco  and trade accounts receivable normally reach peak levels in succession 
we normally finance this expansion of current assets with cash  short term notes payable to banks  and customer advances  and these funding sources normally reach their peak usage in each region during its respective processing period 
our balance sheet at our fiscal year end reflects seasonal expansions in working capital in south america  central america  and western europe 
customers a material part of our business is dependent upon a few customers 
for the year ended march   each of philip morris international  inc  japan tobacco inc  and imperial tobacco group  plc  including its respective affiliates  accounted for or more of our revenues 
the loss of  or substantial reduction in business from  any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our results 
we have long standing relationships with these customers 
for information on possible changes in the industry  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other information regarding management s actions and trends 
we had orders from customers for approximately million of the tobacco in our inventories at march  based upon historical experience  we expect that at least of such orders will be delivered during the following twelve months 
most of our product requires shipment via oceangoing vessel to reach customer destinations 
delays in the delivery of orders can result from such factors as container availability and port access  or changing customer requirements for shipment 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item to this annual report  we recognize sales revenue at the time that title to the tobacco and risk of loss passes to our customer 
individual shipments may be large  and since the customer typically specifies shipping dates  our financial results may vary significantly between reporting periods due to timing of sales 
in some markets  principally the united states  we process tobacco that is owned by our customers  and we recognize the revenue for that service when the processing is completed 
competition the leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive 
competition among leaf tobacco merchants is based on the ability to meet customer specifications in the buying  processing  and financing of tobacco  and on the price charged for products and services 
competition varies depending on the market or country involved 
the number of competitors varies from country to country  but there is competition in most areas to buy the available tobacco 
our principal competitor is alliance one international  inc alliance one 
alliance one operates in many of the countries where we operate 
we believe that we hold the larger worldwide market share based on volume handled by our subsidiaries and affiliates 
however  based on our estimates  we do not believe that the market shares differ substantially between the two companies 
some of our major customers are partially vertically integrated  and thus  also compete with us for the purchase of leaf tobacco in many of the major markets 
in most major markets  smaller competitors are very active 
these competitors typically have lower overhead requirements and provide less support to customers and farmers 
due to their lower cost structures  they can often offer a price on products that is lower than our price 
however  we believe that we provide quality controls that are necessary for our customers and make our products highly competitive 

table of contents reportable segments we evaluate the performance of our business by geographic region  although the dark air cured and oriental tobacco businesses are each evaluated on the basis of their worldwide operations 
performance of the oriental tobacco operations is evaluated based on our equity in the pretax earnings of our affiliate 
under this structure  we have the following primary operating segments north america  south america  africa  europe  asia  dark air cured  oriental  and special services 
north america  south america  africa  europe  and asia are primarily involved in flue cured and burley leaf tobacco operations for supply to cigarette manufacturers 
dark air cured supplies dark air cured tobacco principally to manufacturers of cigars  pipe tobacco  and smokeless tobacco products  and oriental supplies oriental tobacco to cigarette manufacturers 
from time to time  the segments may trade in tobaccos that differ from their main varieties  but those activities are not significant to their overall results 
special services provides just in time inventory services and laboratory services including physical and chemical product testing for customers 
the five regional operating segments serving our cigarette manufacturer customers share similar characteristics in the nature of their products and services  production processes  class of customer  product distribution methods  and regulatory environment 
based on the applicable accounting guidance  four of the regions south america  africa  europe  and asia are aggregated into a single reporting segment  other regions  because they also have similar economic characteristics 
north america is reported as an individual operating segment  because its economic characteristics differ from the other regions  generally because its operations do not require significant working capital investments for crop financing and inventory and because toll processing is an important source of its operating income 
the dark air cured  oriental  and special services segments  which have differing characteristics in some of the categories mentioned above  are reported together as other tobacco operations  because each is below the measurement threshold for separate reporting 
financial information about segments our north america and other regions reportable segments  which represent our flue cured and burley tobacco operations  accounted for and of our revenues and and of our segment operating income  respectively  in fiscal year our other tobacco operations reportable segment accounted for of our revenues and of our segment operating income in fiscal year sales and other operating revenues and operating income attributable to our reportable segments for each of the last three fiscal years  along with segment assets for each reportable segment at march    and  are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this annual report 
information with respect to the geographic distribution of our revenues and long lived assets is also set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements

employees we employed over  employees throughout the world during the fiscal year ended march  this figure is estimated because the majority of our personnel are seasonal employees 
d 
research and development no material amounts were expended for research and development during the fiscal years ended march    or e 
patents  etc 
we hold no material patents  licenses  franchises  or concessions 
f 
government regulation  environmental matters  and other matters our business is subject to general governmental regulation in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business 
such regulation includes  but is not limited to  matters relating to environmental protection 
to date  governmental provisions regulating the discharge of material into the environment have not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of government regulations and other factors that may affect our business 

table of contents item a 
risk factors operating factors the leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive  and we are heavily reliant on a few large customers 
we are one of two major independent global competitors in the highly competitive leaf tobacco industry  both of whom are reliant upon a few large customers 
the loss of one of those large customers or a significant decrease in their demand for our products or services could significantly decrease our sales of products or services  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the competition among leaf tobacco merchants is based on the ability to meet customer specifications in the buying  processing  and financing of tobacco  and on the price charged for products and services 
we believe that we consistently meet our customers specifications and charge competitive prices 
because we rely upon a few significant customers  the consolidation  significant vertical integration  or failure of any of these large or significant customers could contribute to a significant decrease in our sales of products and services 
we have seen an increase in competition from small competitors in some of the markets where we conduct business 
some of these competitors have expanded to operate in more than one country 
these small competitors typically have lower overhead requirements 
they provide little or no support to farmers 
due to their lower cost structures  they often can offer a price on products that is lower than our price 
we have also seen an increase in our customers directly sourcing leaf tobacco from farmers to meet some of their raw material needs 
if our customers shift significant purchases to these smaller competitors or source significant quantities themselves  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
our financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the balance of supply and demand for leaf tobacco 
because we are a leaf tobacco merchant  our financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the overall balance of worldwide supply and demand for leaf tobacco 
the demand for tobacco  which is based upon customers expectations of their future requirements  can change from time to time depending upon internal and external factors affecting the demand for their products 
our customers expectations and their demand for leaf tobacco are influenced by a number of factors  including trends in the global consumption of cigarettes  trends in sales of cigars and other tobacco products  and levels of competition among our customers 
the world supply of leaf tobacco at any given time is a function of current tobacco production  inventories held by manufacturers  and the volumes of uncommitted stocks of processed tobacco held by leaf tobacco merchants from prior years production 
production of tobacco in a given year may be significantly affected by such factors as weather and natural disasters  including any adverse weather conditions that may result from climate change  crop infestation and disease  availability of crop inputs  volume of annual tobacco plantings and yields realized by farmers  farmer elections to grow crops other than tobacco  elimination of government subsidies to farmers  and demographic shifts that change the number of farmers or the amount of land available to grow tobacco 
any significant change in these factors could cause a material imbalance in the supply and demand for tobacco  which would affect our results of operations 

table of contents our financial results will vary according to growing conditions  customer requirements  and other factors 
these factors also limit the ability to accurately forecast our future performance and increase the risk of an investment in our common stock or other securities 
our financial results  particularly our year over year quarterly comparisons  may be significantly affected by variations in tobacco growing seasons and fluctuations in crop sizes 
the timing of the cultivation and delivery of tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors  including weather and other natural events  and our processing schedules and results of operations can be significantly altered by these factors 
in addition  the potential impact of climate change is uncertain and may vary by geographic region 
the possible effects  as described in various public accounts  could include changes in rainfall patterns  water shortages  changing sea levels  changing storm patterns and intensities  and changing temperature levels that could adversely impact our costs and business operations and the supply and demand for leaf tobacco 
our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services 
a disruption in transportation services  as a result of climate change or otherwise  may also significantly impact our results of operations 
further  the timing and unpredictability of customer orders and shipments may require us to keep tobacco in inventory or otherwise increase our risk and result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results 
we base sales recognition on the passage of ownership  usually with shipment of product 
since individual shipments may represent significant amounts of revenue  our quarterly and annual financial results may vary significantly depending on the needs and shipping instructions of our customers and the availability of transportation services 
these fluctuations result in varying volumes and sales in given periods  which also reduce the comparability of financial results for different periods or for the same periods in different years 
major shifts in customer requirements for tobacco supply may significantly affect our operating results 
if our customers significantly alter their requirements for tobacco volumes from certain regions  we may have to change our production facilities and alter our fixed asset base in certain origins 
permanent or long term reduction in demand for tobacco from origins where we have operations may trigger restructuring and impairment charges 
we may also need to make significant capital investments in other regions to develop the needed infrastructure to meet customer supply requirements 
in areas where we purchase leaf tobacco directly from farmers  we bear the risk that the tobacco we receive will not meet quality and quantity requirements 
when we contract directly with tobacco farmers or tobacco farmer cooperatives  which is the method we use to purchase tobacco in most countries  we bear the risk that the tobacco delivered may not meet customer quality and quantity requirements 
if the tobacco does not meet such market requirements  we may not be able to meet all of our customers orders  and such failure would have an adverse effect on profitability and results of operations 
because in a contract market we buy all of the farmers production  which encompasses many styles  we also have a risk that not all of that production will be readily marketable 
in addition  in many foreign countries where we purchase tobacco directly from farmers  we provide them with financing 
unless we receive marketable tobacco that meets the quality and quantity specifications of our customers  we bear the risk that we will not be able to fully recover our crop advances or recover them in a reasonable period of time 
weather and other conditions can affect the marketability of our products 
tobacco crops are subject to vagaries of weather and the environment that can  in some cases  change the quality or size of the crops 
if a weather event is particularly severe  such as a major drought or hurricane  the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to manufacturers  which would result in a reduction in revenues 
if such an event is also widespread  it could affect our ability to acquire the quantity of products required by our customers 
in addition  other factors can affect the marketability of tobacco  including  among other things  the presence of excess residues of pesticides  fungicides  and herbicides  foreign matter  and genetically modified organisms 
a significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the crops that we buy could make it difficult for us to sell these products or to fill customers orders 

table of contents regulatory and governmental factors government efforts to regulate the production and consumption of tobacco products could have a significant impact on the businesses of our customers  which would  in turn  affect our results of operations 
the us federal government and certain state and local governments have taken or proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing us consumption of tobacco products and indirectly reducing demand for our products and services 
these activities have included restrictions on the use of tobacco products in public places and places of employment  legislation authorizing the us food and drug administration the fda to regulate the manufacturing and marketing of tobacco products  increases in the federal  state  and local excise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products  and the policy of the us government to link certain federal grants to the enforcement of state laws restricting the sale of tobacco products 
numerous other legislative and regulatory anti smoking measures have been proposed at the federal  state  and local levels 
the united states represents only of the world market for cigarette production outside of the people s republic of china 
a number of foreign governments and global non government organizations also have taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit tobacco product advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on tobacco products  to indirectly limit the use of certain types of tobacco  and to discourage tobacco product consumption 
a number of such measures are included in the framework convention on tobacco control fctc  which was negotiated and promoted globally under the auspices of the world health organization who 
we cannot predict the extent to which the efforts of governments or non governmental agencies to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of our primary customers 
however  a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
government actions can have a significant effect on the sourcing of tobacco 
if some of the current efforts are successful  we could have difficulty obtaining sufficient tobacco to meet our customers requirements  which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations 
the who  through the fctc  has created a formal study group to identify and assess crop diversification initiatives and alternatives to leaf tobacco growing in countries whose economies depend upon tobacco production 
the study group began its work in february if certain countries were to partner with the fctc study group and seek to eliminate or significantly reduce leaf tobacco production  we could encounter difficulty in sourcing leaf tobacco to fill customer requirements  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues  including climate change  conservation  and natural resource management  could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight of industry activities  which may lead to increased levels of expenditures for environmental controls  land use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers  and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
for example  certain aspects of our business generate carbon emissions 
regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed 
these may include limitations on such emissions  taxes or emission allowance fees on such emissions  various restrictions on industrial operations  and other measures that could affect land use decisions  the cost of agricultural production  and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products 
these actions could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents because we conduct a significant portion of our operations internationally  political and economic uncertainties in certain countries could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations 
our international operations are subject to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  principally in developing countries and emerging markets  and also to the effects of changes in the trade policies and economic regulations of foreign governments 
these uncertainties and risks  which include undeveloped or antiquated commercial law  the expropriation or nationalization of assets  and the authority to revoke or refuse to renew business licenses and work permits  may adversely impact our ability to effectively manage our operations in those countries 
for example  in the past  we have experienced significant year to year fluctuations in earnings due to changes in the brazilian government s economic policies  and government actions in zimbabwe have reduced the tobacco crop there  causing us to shift sourcing of tobacco to other countries 
we have substantial capital investments in south america and africa  and the performance of our operations in those regions can materially affect our earnings 
if the political situation in any of the countries where we conduct business were to deteriorate significantly  our ability to recover assets located there could be impaired 
to the extent that we do not replace any lost volumes of tobacco with tobacco from other sources  or we incur increased costs related to such replacement  our financial condition  results of operations  or both would suffer 
changes in tax laws in the countries where we do business may adversely affect our results of operations 
through our subsidiaries  we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect our earnings  as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
in most jurisdictions  we regularly have audits and examinations by the designated tax authorities  and additional tax assessments are common 
we believe that we routinely comply with applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate  and we vigorously contest all significant tax assessments where we believe we are in compliance with the tax laws 

table of contents financial factors failure of our customers or farmers to repay extensions of credit could materially impact our results of operations 
we extend credit to both farmers and customers 
a significant bad debt provision related to amounts due could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  crop advances to farmers are generally secured by the farmers agreement to deliver green tobacco 
in the event of crop failure  delivery failure  or permanent reductions in crop sizes  full recovery of advances may never be realized  or otherwise could be delayed until future crops are delivered 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item for more information on these extensions of credit 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our results of operations 
we account for most of our tobacco operations using the us dollar as the functional currency 
the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  and we finance most of our tobacco operations in us dollars 
although this generally limits foreign exchange risk to the economic risk that is related to leaf purchase and production costs  overhead  and income taxes in the source country  significant currency movements could materially impact our results of operations 
changes in exchange rates can make a particular crop more or less expensive in us dollar terms 
if a particular crop is viewed as expensive in us dollar terms  it may be less attractive in the world market 
this could negatively affect the profitability of that crop and our results of operations 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  we use the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these markets are hungary  poland  and the philippines 
in other markets  such as western europe  where export sales have been denominated primarily in local currencies  we also use the local currency as the functional currency 
in these markets  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
see item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk for additional discussion related to foreign currency exchange risk 
our purchases of tobacco are generally made in local currency  and we also provide farmer advances that are denominated in the local currency 
we account for currency remeasurement gains or losses on those advances as period costs  and they are usually accompanied by offsetting increases or decreases in the purchase cost of tobacco  which is priced in the local currency 
the effect of differences in the cost of tobacco is generally not realized in our earnings until the tobacco is sold  which often occurs in a quarter or fiscal year subsequent to the recognition of the related remeasurement gains or losses 
the difference in timing could affect our profitability in a given quarter or fiscal year 
for example  during fiscal year  we recorded remeasurement losses of more than million related to a significant devaluation of the brazilian currency 
we have used currency hedging strategies to reduce our foreign currency exchange rate risks in some markets 
in addition  where there are no active forward foreign exchange markets in countries where we source tobacco  we often manage our foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale and by minimizing our net investment in these countries 
to the extent that we have net monetary assets or liabilities in local currency  we may have currency remeasurement gains or losses that will affect our results of operations 
changes in interest rates may affect our results of operations 
in our business  customers usually either pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased on order 
from time to time  we borrow long term debt at fixed rates 
through hedging agreements  we may swap the interest rates on our existing fixed rate debt to floating market interest rates to better match the interest rates that we charge our customers 
to the extent we are unable to match these interest rates  a decrease in short term interest rates could increase our net financing costs 
in addition  at times we may have significant amounts of cash invested 
decreases in short term interest rates reduce the income we derive from those investments 
changes in interest rates also affect expense related to our defined benefit pension plan  as described elsewhere in these risk factors 

table of contents low investment performance by our defined benefit pension plan assets may increase our pension expense  and may require us to fund a larger portion of our pension obligations  thus  diverting funds from other potential uses 
we sponsor a domestic defined benefit pension plan that covers certain eligible employees 
our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for this plan 
us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations 
these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions  which may change based on changes in key economic indicators 
the most significant year end assumptions we used to estimate pension income or expense for are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in addition  we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities  which may result in a significant change to shareholders equity through a reduction or increase to funded status of pension and other postretirement benefits 
at the end of fiscal year  the projected benefit obligation of our us principal pension plan was million and assets were million 
for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies  see critical accounting estimates pension and other postretirement benefit plans in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related  key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans under requirements of the employee retirement income security act erisa 
failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans

item legal proceedings european commission fines in spain in october  the european commission the commission imposed fines on five companies active in the raw spanish tobacco processing market totaling million for colluding on the prices paid to  and the quantities bought from  the tobacco growers in spain 
two of our subsidiaries  tabacos espanoles sa taes  a purchaser and processor of raw tobacco in spain  and deltafina  spa deltafina  an italian subsidiary  were among the five companies assessed fines 
in its decision  the commission imposed a fine of  on taes  and a fine of million on deltafina 
deltafina did not and does not purchase or process raw tobacco in the spanish market  but was and is a significant buyer of tobacco from some of the spanish processors 
we recorded a charge of about million approximately million at the september exchange rate in the second quarter of fiscal year to accrue the full amount of the fines assessed against our subsidiaries 
in january  deltafina filed an appeal in the general court of the european union 
the main ground of appeal is that the commission erred in imposing liability on deltafina as a cartel participant  particularly as the cartel leader  when deltafina was not an actual party to the agreement and was incapable of acting in the relevant market 
in addition  deltafina argues that i the commission failed to allege that deltafina was a member of the cartel and cartel leader prior to issuing its decision  thereby impairing deltafina s right to defend itself  and ii that the commission failed to try to prove that the practices affected trade between member states of the european community 
the appeal also argues that the commission incorrectly calculated the amount of the deltafina fine 
although a hearing on the matter was held in june  the outcome of the appeal is uncertain  and an ultimate resolution to the matter could take several years 
deltafina has deposited funds in an escrow account with the commission in the amount of the fine in order to stay execution during the appeal process 
this deposit is classified as a non current asset 
european commission fines in italy in  we reported that we were aware that the commission was investigating certain aspects of the tobacco leaf markets in italy 
deltafina buys and processes tobacco in italy 
we reported that we did not believe that the commission investigation in italy would result in penalties being assessed against us or our subsidiaries that would be material to our earnings 
the reason we held this belief was that we had received conditional immunity from the commission because deltafina had voluntarily informed the commission of the activities that were the basis of the investigation 
on december   we received a preliminary indication that the commission intended to revoke deltafina s immunity for disclosing in april that it had applied for immunity 
neither the commission s leniency notice of february   nor deltafina s letter of provisional immunity contains a specific requirement of confidentiality 
the potential for such disclosure was discussed with the commission in march  and the commission never told deltafina that the disclosure would affect deltafina s immunity 
on november   we received notification that the commission had imposed fines totaling million about million at the march  exchange rate on deltafina and universal corporation jointly for infringing european union antitrust law in connection with the purchase and processing of tobacco in the italian raw tobacco market 
we do not believe that the decision can be reconciled with the commission s statement of objections and facts 
both deltafina and universal corporation filed appeals in the general court of the european union 
based on consultation with outside legal counsel  we believe it is probable that we will prevail in the appeals process  and therefore we have not accrued a charge or interest for the fine 
if both deltafina and universal corporation were ultimately found liable for the full amount of the fine  then accumulated interest on the fine would also be due and payable 
accumulated interest totaled approximately million about million at march  deltafina has provided a bank guarantee to the commission in the amount of the fine plus accumulated interest in order to stay execution during the appeals process 

table of contents us foreign corrupt practices act as a result of a posting to our ethics complaint hotline alleging improper activities that involved or related to certain of our tobacco subsidiaries  the audit committee of our board of directors engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation of the alleged activities 
that investigation revealed that there have been payments that may have violated the us foreign corrupt practices act 
the payments approximated million over a seven year period 
in addition  the investigation revealed activities in foreign jurisdictions that may have violated the competition laws of such jurisdictions  but we believe those activities did not violate us antitrust laws 
we voluntarily reported these activities to the department of justice doj and the sec in march on june   the sec notified us that a formal order of investigation had been issued 
since voluntarily reporting  we have cooperated with and assisted the doj and sec in their investigations  and for the past year we have engaged in settlement discussions with both authorities to resolve the matter 
those negotiations have resulted in agreements in principle being reached with representatives of the doj and the staff of the sec 
the final resolution of this matter remains subject to the completion of definitive agreements and the approval and execution of those agreements by the doj and the sec 
in addition  each settlement is subject to the approval of a federal district court with jurisdiction over the matter 
we have been given no assurance that the settlements will be approved by the doj  sec  or federal district courts 
based on the agreements in principle that have been reached to date  the resolution of this matter with the doj and the sec is expected to include injunctive relief  disgorgement and prejudgment interest  fines  penalties  and the retention of an independent compliance monitor 
based in part on the progress of the matter and consultation with outside counsel  we have recorded accruals from time to time since the matter arose that are adequate to satisfy the estimated financial settlement we expect with the resolution of the matter 
the financial settlement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other legal matters in addition to the above mentioned matters  some of our subsidiaries are involved in other litigation or legal matters incidental to their business activities 
while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  we are vigorously defending the matters and do not currently expect that any of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
however  should one or more of these matters be resolved in a manner adverse to our current expectation  the effect on our results of operations for a particular fiscal reporting period could be material
