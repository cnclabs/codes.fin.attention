overview our business alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum  fabricated aluminum  and alumina combined  through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology  mining  refining  smelting  fabricating  and recycling 
aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange 
table of contents lme and priced daily based on market supply and demand 
aluminum and alumina represent more than three fourths of alcoa s revenues  and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 
nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners 
alcoa s products are used worldwide in aircraft  automobiles  commercial transportation  packaging  building and construction  oil and gas  defense  and industrial applications 
alcoa is a global company operating in countries 
based upon the country where the point of sale occurred  the us and europe generated and  respectively  of alcoa s sales in in addition  alcoa has investments and operating activities in australia  brazil  china  iceland  guinea  russia  and the kingdom of saudi arabia  all of which present opportunities for substantial growth 
governmental policies  laws and regulations  and other economic factors  including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  affect the results of operations in these countries 
management review of and outlook for the future in  management was faced with the challenge of preserving alcoa s future while navigating the company through a global economic downturn that coupled an unprecedented decline in lme pricing levels began in the second half of with a collapse in demand from aluminum product end markets 
management adopted a holistic response to this situation by initiating various actions  including curtailing additional refinery and smelter capacity necessitating further layoffs  instituting programs to identify procurement efficiencies  overhead rationalization  and working capital improvements  reducing the quarterly common stock dividend  and issuing new equity and debt instruments 
all of these actions were aimed at reducing costs  improving cash levels  and preserving liquidity 
certain financial and nonfinancial information reflecting these challenges and management s actions were as follows sales of  and a loss from continuing operations of  or per diluted share  cash from operations of  and cash on hand at the end of the year of  almost double the level at december  reduction in total debt of and debt to capital ratio of  a basis point improvement from  capital expenditures of  a more than reduction from  the completion and start up of the expanded refinery and new bauxite mine in brazil  new lithographic sheet operations in bohai china  and a new can sheet and end and tab line in russia  secured long term power contracts on approximately  kmt canada  spain  and the us of the global smelting system of system secured through at least  optimized alcoa s business and investment portfolio through the following actions monetized the investment in shining prospect  exchanged an equity interest in a soft alloy extrusion joint venture sapa ab for full ownership of two smelters and an anode facility in norway  acquired bhp billiton s interests in bauxite mines and a refinery in the republic of suriname  entered into an agreement with the saudi arabian mining company known as ma aden to develop a complete industrial complex that will encompass the aluminum manufacturing process from bauxite mining to aluminum fabrication  and completed the divestiture of the electronic and electrical solutions ees business 
in  management expects market conditions for aluminum products in certain end markets to improve  particularly in automotive and commercial transportation  while others are expected to decline  including aerospace  building and construction  and industrial gas turbines 
management is also projecting an increase in the consumption of primary aluminum  especially in china 
on the cost side  increases in energy prices and continued currency movements are expected to be a challenge 
management is committed to achieving the following goals in securing and improving on the savings realized in from procurement  overhead  and working capital programs  continuing to strengthen the balance sheet using operating cash flows to further reduce debt levels  and 
table of contents optimizing businesses for improved market conditions by continuing to bring the upstream operations down on the cost curve eg  the new complex in saudi arabia and positioning the downstream operations in profitable markets 
results of operations earnings summary loss from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of  or per share  in the change of  in continuing operations was primarily due to the following significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  large volume decreases in the downstream segments  a charge associated with electricity pricing in italy  a loss on the sale of an equity investment  charges related to the restructuring program  and higher depreciation and interest charges  all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses  the absence of the charges associated with the restructuring program  net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  favorable lifo last in  first out inventory adjustments  various discrete income tax benefits and a significant fluctuation in income taxes due to a change in the results of operations from pretax income to a pretax loss  a gain on the exchange of equity interests  a gain on the acquisition of an entity in the republic of suriname  and net income of various other nonoperating items 
income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per diluted share  compared with  or per share  in the decrease in income from continuing operations was mostly due to the following the absence of the gain related to the sale of alcoa s investment in aluminum corporation of china limited chalco  charges for the restructuring program  continued increases in raw materials  energy  and other inputs  net unfavorable foreign currency movements  the absence of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment for months  and costs associated with a gas outage in western australia and a complete smelter curtailment in rockdale  tx 
these negative impacts were slightly offset by the absence of the following items that occurred in charges for the restructuring program  certain costs associated with the rockdale  tennessee  and iceland smelters  and transaction costs and interest charges related to a potential business combination 
net loss attributable to alcoa for was  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of  or per share  in  and net income of  or per share  in in and  the net loss of  and included a loss from discontinued operations of and  respectively  all related to the ees business 
in  net income of  included a loss from discontinued operations of  comprised of a loss related to the ees business and a net loss of other discontinued businesses 
in march  alcoa announced a series of operational and financial actions  which were in addition to those announced at the end of  to significantly improve alcoa s cost structure and liquidity 
operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements 
financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share  which began with the dividend paid on may   and the issuance of million shares of common stock and in convertible notes that collectively yielded  in net proceeds 
in late  management made the decision to reduce alcoa s aluminum and alumina production in response to the significant economic downturn 
as a result of this decision  reductions of kmt  or  of annualized output from alcoa s global smelting system were implemented includes previous curtailment at rockdale  tx in june 
accordingly  reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by  kmt per year across the global refining system 
the aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early as planned 
smelters in rockdale kmt per year and tennessee kmt per year were fully curtailed while another kmt per year was partially curtailed at various other locations 
the refinery in point comfort  tx was partially curtailed by approximately  kmt per year between the end of and the beginning of only approximately half of this amount remains curtailed as of december  
in mid  further action became 
table of contents necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the massena east  ny smelter kmt per year and partially curtail the suralco suriname refinery kmt per year represented awac s previous ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately kmt 
in june  alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production three of six operating potlines or kmt at its rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues 
in september  alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines  or kmt  as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter  well known issues regarding the cost and long term reliability of the power supply  and overall market conditions 
in  the earnings impact of the idled potlines was pretax 
alcoa is seeking damages and other relief from its power supplier through ongoing litigation 
additionally  in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines  alcoa recorded restructuring charges in of pretax mostly for the layoff of approximately employees see restructuring and other charges below for additional information 
also in june  a major gas supplier to alcoa s western australia refining operations part of alcoa of australia suffered a pipeline rupture and fire  which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier s gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers 
the disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in alcoa of australia s production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations 
as a result  shortly thereafter  alcoa of australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts 
during the second half of  the supplier partially restored the gas supply to alcoa of australia full restoration occurred in the first half of 
in addition  insurance recoveries of were received in the second half of net of insurance benefits  alcoa s earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was before tax and noncontrolling interest in the alumina segment was impacted by before tax and the remaining impact of before tax was reflected in corporate due to alcoa s captive insurance program 
in  additional insurance recoveries of were received  which benefited the results of alcoa by before tax and noncontrolling interest and the alumina segment by before tax 
alcoa of australia is part of alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac  which is owned by alcoa and owned by alumina limited 
sales sales for were  compared with sales of  in  a decline of  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a drop in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  driven by significantly lower london metal exchange lme prices  volume declines in the downstream segments due to continued weak end markets  unfavorable foreign currency movements  mostly the result of a weaker euro and australian dollar  and the absence of sales from the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment in  all of which was slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in norway 
sales for were  compared with sales of  in  a decline of  or 
the decrease was driven mainly by the absence of months of sales  from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment  the absence of sales from the soft alloy extrusion business  in  and volume declines for most downstream businesses  especially related to the automotive and commercial transportation markets in north america and europe 
these negative impacts were principally offset by significantly higher primary aluminum volumes  mostly as a result of sales related to the production of the iceland smelter for a full year  and favorable foreign currency movements  primarily due to a stronger euro and australian dollar 
cost of goods sold cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage was negatively impacted by significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  lower demand in the downstream segments  and a charge related to a recent european commission s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 
these items were somewhat offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses  net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  and positive lifo adjustments 
in  alcoa recognized after tax in income due to the reductions in lifo inventory quantities and the considerable drop in lme prices 
of this amount  occurred in the second half of the year 
during  
table of contents management expects to maintain inventory levels comparable to  however  this will not generate lifo income in the first quarter of and is not expected to generate lifo income for the remainder of cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the increase in the percentage was mainly the result of continued cost increases in raw materials  energy  and other inputs  unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker us dollar  the production at the iceland smelter that did not occur in  and the impacts of the gas outage in western australia and the smelter curtailment at rockdale 
these items were primarily offset by the absence of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment for months  the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business in  productivity improvements in most of the businesses within the engineered products and solutions segment  and the absence of certain costs incurred in as a result of production curtailments associated with the tennessee and rockdale smelters and startup costs at the iceland smelter  among others 
selling  general administrative  and other expenses sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the decline of was primarily due to reductions in labor costs  mainly as a result of implemented severance programs  decreases in expenses for travel  contractors and consultants  information technology  selling and marketing  and various other administrative items as part of alcoa s cost reduction initiatives  the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment in  and a decrease in bad debt expense  all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation  mostly the result of the plans improved performance  and an increase due to sg a of the acquired smelters in norway 
sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the decrease of was mostly due to the absence of months of expenses from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment  the absence of transaction costs related to the offer for alcan inc  and the absence of expenses from the soft alloy extrusion business in 
research and development expenses r d expenses were in compared with in and in the decline in as compared to was principally due to the implementation of alcoa s cost reduction initiatives and the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment in 
the increase in as compared to was mainly driven by expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the flat rolled products segment and the primary metals segment  partially offset by the absence of months of expenditures from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment 
provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the increase of  or  was mostly due to the acquired smelters in norway and assets placed into service during  including the juruti bauxite mine and s o luis refinery in brazil  the new bohai china flat rolled product facility  and a high quality coated sheet line at the samara russia facility 
these increases were slightly offset as a result of the cessation of dd a  which began in january  related to the global foil and transportation products europe businesses due to the classification of these businesses as held for sale and a reduction in dd a as a result of the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review  which was completed in mid  of estimated useful lives the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the decline of  or  was principally the result of the absence of nine months of depreciation from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment in  which was classified as held for sale  and the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of refining and smelting locations and various rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review of estimated useful lives completed during 
offsetting these reductions was a significant increase in depreciation expense related to the iceland smelter and norway anode facility being in service for a full year and unfavorable foreign currency movements as a result of a weaker us dollar 

table of contents restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for each of the three years in the period ended december  were comprised of the following asset impairments layoff costs other exit costs reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs restructuring and other charges reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs resulted from changes in facts and circumstances that led to changes in estimated costs 
layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated  benefits to be paid under existing severance plans  union contracts or statutory requirements  and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 
restructuring program in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately  employees  in the engineered products and solutions segment   in the flat rolled products segment   in the primary metals segment  in the alumina segment  and in corporate to address the impact of the global economic downturn on alcoa s businesses and a after tax curtailment charge due to the remeasurement of pension plans as a result of the workforce reductions  after tax in adjustments to the global foil and transportation products europe businesses held for sale due to unfavorable foreign currency movements for both businesses and a change in the estimated fair value for the global foil business and after tax in other asset impairments  after tax for the write off of previously capitalized third party costs related to potential business acquisitions due to the adoption of changes to accounting for business combinations and net costs of after tax and noncontrolling interests for various other items  such as accelerated depreciation and lease termination costs for shutdown facilities  and after tax and noncontrolling interests for reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances 
as of december   approximately  of the  employees were terminated 
cash payments of were made against the restructuring program layoff reserves in restructuring program in late  alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio  partly due to the economic downturn 
such actions included targeted reductions  curtailments  and plant closures and consolidations  which will reduce headcount by approximately  resulting in layoff charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  asset impairments of after tax and noncontrolling interests  and other exit costs of after tax 
the significant components of these actions were as follows as a result of market conditions  the primary metals segment reduced production by kmt and the alumina segment reduced production by a total of  kmt fully implemented in early  further reductions occurred later in 
these production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately  positions totaling in layoff costs 
asset impairments of related to these two segments were also recognized  including the write off of in engineering costs related to a  kmt planned expansion of jamalco s clarendon  jamaica refinery 
the flat rolled products segment was restructured through the following actions restructuring and downsizing of the mill products businesses in europe and north america  resulting in severance charges of for the reduction of approximately positions  alignment of production with demand at operations in russia  through the elimination of approximately  positions resulting in severance charges of  
table of contents the shutdown of the foil business in bohai  resulting in severance charges of for the reduction of approximately positions  asset impairments of  and other exits costs of  primarily related to lease termination costs 
the engineered products and solutions segment was restructured through the following actions exiting of the auto cast wheel business  through the closure of the only remaining facility  which employed approximately  by june for severance costs of  consolidation of operations in the building and construction systems business to maximize operating efficiencies and align capacity with the decline in the commercial building and construction markets  resulting in severance charges of for the elimination of approximately positions  alignment of production with demand across the power and propulsion business  resulting in the reduction of approximately positions for a cost of  optimization of the global hard alloy extrusion operations  resulting in severance charges of for a headcount reduction of approximately and asset impairments of previously reported as part of the flat rolled products segment see segment information  other severance charges of for the elimination of approximately positions  asset impairments of  and other exit costs of in order to reduce overhead serving various businesses  approximately positions will be eliminated at corporate  resulting in severance charges of and other exits costs of in addition to the above actions  alcoa intends to sell its global foil the sabi nigo  spain and shanghai  china plants were sold in late and transportation products europe businesses in order to streamline its portfolio 
as a result of this decision  the assets and related liabilities of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses were classified as held for sale 
asset impairments of after tax and after tax were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses  respectively 
also  alcoa and orkla asa agreed to exchange their stakes in the sapa ab and elkem aluminium ans joint ventures 
this portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of after tax to reflect the estimated fair value of alcoa s investment in sapa ab 
earlier in  alcoa recorded after tax in charges  which consisted of after tax for the layoff of approximately employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and after tax for other exit costs  associated with the complete production curtailment of the rockdale  tx smelter kmt due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues 
also during  alcoa recorded a loss of after tax on the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses 
the remaining net charges in were comprised of after tax and noncontrolling interests for layoff related to a reduction in headcount of approximately  for other exit costs after tax  and after tax and noncontrolling interests for reversals of previously recorded costs  slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility 
as of december   approximately  of the  employees were terminated

restructuring program in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax in asset impairments associated with a strategic review of certain businesses  a after tax reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business  which was contributed to a joint venture effective june   and after tax and noncontrolling interests in net charges comprised of layoff charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests related to the elimination of approximately positions and asset impairments of after tax of various other businesses and facilities  
table of contents other exit costs of after tax and noncontrolling interests  primarily for accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of certain facilities in related to the restructuring program  and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs of after tax and noncontrolling interests due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances 
in april  alcoa announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for the potential disposition of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment and the automotive castings business 
in september  management completed its review of strategic alternatives and determined that the best course of action was to sell the packaging and consumer and automotive castings businesses 
as a result of this decision  the assets and related liabilities of the packaging and consumer and automotive castings businesses were classified as held for sale 
alcoa recorded impairment charges of after tax related to the packaging and consumer businesses and after tax for the automotive castings business to reflect the write down of the carrying value of the assets of these businesses to their respective estimated fair values 
in addition  alcoa recorded a discrete income tax charge related to goodwill associated with the planned sale of the packaging and consumer businesses that would have been non deductible for tax purposes under the transaction structure contemplated at the time 
in november  alcoa completed the sale of the automotive castings business and recognized a loss of after tax 
in december  alcoa agreed to sell the packaging and consumer businesses for  in cash  and reduced the impairment charge by after tax and the discrete income tax charge by as a result of the structure of the agreed upon sale this sale was completed in 
as of december   the terminations associated with the restructuring program were essentially complete 
cash payments of and were made against the restructuring program layoff reserves in and  respectively 
alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments 
the pretax impact of allocating restructuring and other charges to such results would have been as follows prior period amounts presented were revised to reflect a change in segments see segment information alumina primary metals flat rolled products engineered products and solutions packaging and consumer segment total corporate total restructuring and other charges interest expense interest expense was in compared with in  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level  mostly the result of in convertible notes issued in march and increased borrowings on loans in brazil began in april related to the juruti  s o lu s  and estreito growth projects  and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs  mainly due to a beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and in fees paid for the  day senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in october and expired in october  both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of alcoa s debt portfolio 
interest expense was in compared with in  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was principally caused by a higher average debt level  mostly due to the issuance of  in new senior notes in july and significantly higher commercial paper levels  and a decrease in capitalized interest  primarily due to placing growth projects into service  such as the iceland smelter and the norway anode facility in these items were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the offer for alcan inc and a lower weighted average effective interest rate  driven mainly by the decrease in libor rates 

table of contents other income  net other income  net was in compared with in the increase of was mainly the result of a gain on the elkem sapa ab exchange transaction  favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  net gains related to the improvement in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance  an gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname  and a gain on the sale of property in vancouver  wa 
these positive impacts were partially offset by a realized loss on the sale of the shining prospect investment  a decline in the value of mark to market derivative contracts  a decrease in equity income related to alcoa s share of the results of elkem  sapa ab  and shining prospect prior to the exchange and sale of these investments  the absence of a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment  and an estimated loss on excess power at the ferndale  wa smelter 
other income  net was in compared with  in the decrease of  was mostly due to the absence of the  gain related to the sale of alcoa s investment in chalco 
other items impacting this decline were losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets  unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  the absence of dividend income from alcoa s former stake in chalco  and the absence of a non recurring foreign currency gain in russia  all of which was partially offset by mark to market gains on derivative contracts and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior alcoa divestiture 
income taxes alcoa s effective tax rate was benefit on a loss in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the following discrete tax items a benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment  a benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets  a benefit for a tax rate change from to in iceland  a benefit related to a canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in us dollars  a benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the global foil business than originally anticipated  and a benefit related to the elkem sapa ab exchange transaction 
partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in italy  which included a valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows related to a recent decision by the european commission on electricity pricing  for environmental remediation  and for layoffs 
alcoa s effective tax rate was provision on income in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the following income tax charges for the asset impairments included in the restructuring program  due to a decrease in deferred tax assets of the iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change from to  a net associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses  mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated  somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations 
these charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the us income tax return 
alcoa s effective tax rate was provision on income in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to lower taxes on foreign income  mostly offset by a discrete income tax charge of related to goodwill that is non deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses 
management anticipates that the effective tax rate in will be approximately 
however  changes in the current economic environment  tax legislation  currency fluctuations  and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate significantly 
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with in the decline of was principally due to lower earnings at awac  which is owned by alcoa and by alumina limited 
the lower earnings at awac were mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices  
table of contents somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the absence of the impact of the gas outage in western australia 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with in the decrease of was mostly due to lower earnings at awac attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy  unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  and the impact of the gas outage in western australia 
loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of a pretax loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business  a pretax loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business  and the remainder was for the operational results of the ees business prior to the divestitures 
loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of asset impairments of pretax to reflect the estimated fair value of the ees business and a net operating loss of pretax  which included restructuring charges of pretax for headcount reductions of approximately  and a charge of pretax for obsolete inventory 
loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of a loss related to the ees business  including severance charges of pretax for headcount reductions of approximately  as part of a strategic business review to restructure ees  and impairment charges of pretax for goodwill and pretax for various fixed assets  as the forecasted future earnings and cash flows of the ees business no longer supported the carrying values of such assets  an loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the sale of the home exteriors business  and net operating income of for other discontinued businesses 
in late  alcoa reclassified the ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to sell the business 
the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the ees business in discontinued operations 
the sale of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business was completed in june and the sale of the electronics portion of the ees business was completed in december the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the ees business into discontinued operations 
segment information in may  management approved the movement of alcoa s hard alloy extrusions business from the flat rolled products segment to the engineered products and solutions segment 
this move was made to capture market  customer  and manufacturer synergies through the combination of the hard alloy extrusions business with the power and propulsion and forgings businesses 
prior period amounts were reclassified to reflect this change 
alcoa s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina  primary metals  flat rolled products  and engineered products and solutions the packaging and consumer segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 
segment performance under alcoa s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors  however  the primary measure of performance is the after tax operating income atoi of each segment 
certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting  interest income and expense  noncontrolling interests  corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities  along with depreciation and amortization on corporate owned assets  restructuring and other charges  discontinued operations  and other items  including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments  differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate  the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gains losses are excluded from segment atoi 
segment assets exclude  among others  cash and cash equivalents  deferred income taxes  goodwill not allocated to businesses for segment reporting purposes  corporate fixed assets  lifo reserves  and assets classified as held for sale related to discontinued operations 

table of contents atoi for all reportable segments totaled in   in  and  in see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item for additional information 
the following discussion provides shipments  sales  and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december  alumina alumina production kmt third party alumina shipments kmt third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi this segment consists of alcoa s worldwide alumina system  including the mining of bauxite  which is then refined into alumina 
alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers that process it into industrial chemical products 
a portion of this segments s third party sales are completed through the use of agents  alumina traders  and distributors 
slightly more than half of alcoa s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide  while the remainder is used internally 
in  alumina production decreased by kmt compared to the reduction was mostly the result of the effects of curtailments initiated in late through early  which included approximately  kmt per year at the point comfort  tx refinery only approximately half of this amount remains curtailed as of december  and approximately kmt per year at the suralco suriname refinery represented awac s previous ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately kmt 
partially offsetting the curtailments was increased production at the following refineries all set production records in jamalco jamaica  pinjarra and wagerup australia  and s o luis brazil  where ramp up of the  kmt expansion began in late production also increased due to additional capacity of approximately kmt from the acquisition total acquired was approximately kmt was curtailed of bhp billiton s interest in suralco on july  of the suralco refinery s operations were reflected in this segment beginning august  
in  alumina production increased by kmt compared to with the largest increase occurring at the pinjarra refinery due to the continued positive effects of the efficiency upgrade expansion completed in in late  alcoa reduced production at its point comfort refinery by kmt per year due to negative market conditions  however  production for the year slightly exceeded the refinery s production performance 
third party sales for the alumina segment declined in compared with  principally due to a drop in realized prices  driven by significantly lower lme prices  and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker australian dollar  both of which were somewhat offset by an increase in volumes 
third party sales for this segment rose in compared with  primarily related to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger australian dollar and increases of and in third party shipments and realized prices  respectively 
intersegment sales for the alumina segment dropped in compared with  mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a reduction in demand from the primary metals segment 
intersegment sales for this segment climbed in compared with  mainly as a result of a increase in volumes and higher realized prices 
atoi for the alumina segment declined in compared with  principally due to the significant drop in realized prices  a tax settlement related to an equity investment in brazil  and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of growth projects placed into service mid to late in brazil juruti bauxite mine and s o luis refinery  all of which was partially offset by net procurement and overhead cost savings across most regions  favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  a gain recognized on the acquisition of bhp billiton s interest

the potential for further delay in balance sheet improvement and debt reduction as a result of this investment  given moody s expectation for only slow recovery in the aluminum industry and in alcoa s earnings  was a consideration prompting this review

certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components  and  as a result  actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 
operating leases represent multi year obligations for certain computer equipment  plant equipment  vehicles  and buildings 
interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december  and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to the effect of outstanding interest rate swaps  which are accounted for as fair value hedges  are included in interest related to total debt 
as of december   these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on  of debt through as the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable  actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 
estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates  long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trend rates 
the minimum required cash outlays for pension funding are estimated to be for and for see note y to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k

postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate annually  net of the estimated subsidy receipts related to medicare part d  and are reflected in the preceding table through alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and postretirement benefit payments beyond and  respectively 
layoff and other restructuring payments primarily relate to severance costs and are expected to be paid within one year 
amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to ongoing site remediation work  special termination benefit payments  and lease termination costs 
deferred revenue arrangements require alcoa to deliver alumina over the specified contract period through while these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments  they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made 
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december  the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the thereafter column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
obligations for financing activities total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt  including short term borrowings and long term debt 
maturities for long term debt extend to alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock 
including dividends on preferred stock  alcoa paid in dividends to shareholders during because all dividends are subject to approval by alcoa s board of directors  amounts are not included in the preceding table until such authorization has occurred 
as of december   there were  and  shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock  respectively 
the annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of per share 
in march  alcoa decreased its annual common stock dividend from per share to per share  which began with the dividend paid on may   as part of a series of operational and financial actions taken to significantly improve alcoa s liquidity position 

table of contents obligations for investing activities capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of december  funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects 
it is anticipated that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources  including cash provided from operations 
total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately  in in december  alcoa signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new industrial complex in the kingdom of saudi arabia  comprised of a bauxite mine  alumina refinery  aluminum smelter  and rolling mill  which will require the company to spend approximately over a four year period through 
this amount is not reflected in the preceding table  as estimates of amounts per year are still being determined 
payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds 
amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur 
in connection with the acquisition of two fabricating facilities in russia  alcoa could be required to make additional contingent payments of approximately through  but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of these guarantees expire in through and relate to project financing for hydroelectric power projects in brazil 
alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to legal  customs duties  and leasing obligations  among others  which expire at various dates  that total at december  alcoa has outstanding letters of credit in the amount of as of december  these letters of credit relate primarily to workers compensation  derivative contracts  and leasing obligations  and expire at various dates  mostly in alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to customs duties  self insurance  and legal obligations 
the total amount committed under these bonds  which automatically renew or expire at various dates  mostly in  was at december  alcoa has a program to sell a senior undivided interest in certain customer receivables  without recourse  on a continuous basis to a third party for cash 
this program was renewed on october  and expires on october  in august  alcoa increased the capacity of this program from to as of december  and  alcoa derecognized in receivables from customers on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under this program 
alcoa services the customer receivables for the third party at market rates  therefore  no servicing asset or liability was recorded 
alcoa had an existing program with a different third party to sell certain customer receivables 
the sale of receivables under this program was conducted through a qualifying special purpose entity qspe that was bankruptcy remote  and  therefore  was not consolidated by alcoa 
effective august   alcoa terminated this program and all outstanding customer receivables were collected by the qspe through the end of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  asset retirement obligations  the testing of goodwill  equity investments  and properties  plants  and equipment for impairment  estimating fair value of businesses to be divested  pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations  stock based compensation  and income taxes 

table of contents management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
derivatives and hedging 
derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period 
if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur  future gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in other income or expense 
alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges 
as a result  the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense  consistent with the underlying hedged item 
alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to sales  cost of goods sold  or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures  generally not exceeding five years 
if no hedging relationship is designated  the derivative is marked to market through earnings 
cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 
environmental matters 
expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations  which will not contribute to future revenues  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the liability may include costs such as site investigations  consultant fees  feasibility studies  outside contractors  and monitoring expenses 
estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery 
claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties 
the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share 
the liability is periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress  prospective estimates of required activity  and other factors that may be relevant  including changes in technology or regulations 
litigation matters 
for asserted claims and assessments  liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable 
management determines the likelihood of an 
table of contents unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter  available defenses and case strategy  progress of the matter  views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors  applicability and success of appeals processes  and the outcome of similar historical matters  among others 
once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable  management weighs the probability of estimated losses  and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded 
if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible  then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded 
with respect to unasserted claims or assessments  management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely  then  a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made 
legal matters are reviewed periodically or sooner if significant changes in matters have occurred to determine if a change in the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a loss is necessary 
asset retirement obligations 
alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa s bauxite mining  alumina refining  and aluminum smelting facilities 
these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal  closure of bauxite residue areas  mine reclamation  and landfill closure 
alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation  if required by a lease agreement  and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities 
the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis  at the time the obligation is incurred  and accreted over time for the change in present value 
additionally  alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 
certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries  aluminum smelters  and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date 
a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa s control 
such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures  maintenance and upgrade programs  and other factors 
at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made  alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal  treatment  transportation  storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos  underground and aboveground storage tanks  polychlorinated biphenyls  various process residuals  solid wastes  electronic equipment waste  and various other materials 
such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded 
if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately  the estimated caro as of december  ranges from less than to per structure structures in today s dollars 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates  among others 
it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
alcoa has nine reporting units previously there were ten reporting units the ees business was sold in  of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment 
the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment  the primary metals segment  the flat rolled products segment  and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  which is included in corporate 
almost of alcoa s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs  and alcoa power and propulsion app  businesses  both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment  and primary metals 
these amounts include an allocation of corporate goodwill 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its 
table of contents reporting units when testing for impairment  as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units 
cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years 
the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units weighted average cost of capital wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 
in  the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were in excess of their carrying values  resulting in no impairment 
the impairments tests yielded similar results between and  including a smaller excess for primary metals than had been the case historically 
in  the excess of the estimated fair value of primary metals over its carrying value was substantially less than in prior years due to the unprecedented decline in the lme price that occurred in the second half of the year 
historically  lme pricing levels and corresponding input costs eg  raw materials  energy have generally trended in the same manner  resulting in relatively consistent cash margins over time 
however  the decline in the lme price significantly outpaced any decreases in associated input costs  causing expected cash margins in the early years in the dcf model to be lower than normal and lower than long term expectations 
in  the lme price increased gradually throughout the year and exceeded  in whole dollars per metric ton by the end of the year  resulting in higher undiscounted expected future cash flows for primary metals  as the historical trend between lme pricing levels and input costs began to return 
however  primary metals wacc  the measure used by alcoa to discount expected future cash flows  increased from in to in  effectively negating the positive impact the rising lme price had on expected future cash flows 
as a result  primary metals fair value continued to exceed its carrying value even though the excess has not yet returned to levels prior to in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value  additional analysis would be required 
the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill  which may involve the use of valuation experts 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized  which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity 
equity investments 
alcoa invests in a number of privately held companies  primarily through joint ventures and consortiums  which are accounted for on the equity method 
the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee 
management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired 
the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant  sustained declines in an investee s revenue  earnings  and cash flow trends  adverse market conditions of the investee s industry or geographic area  the investee s ability to continue operations measured by several items  including liquidity  and other factors 
once an impairment indicator is identified  management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value 
an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 
properties  plants  and equipment 
properties  plants  and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value  with fair value determined using the best information available  which generally is a dcf model 
the determination of what constitutes an asset group and the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows also require significant judgments 

table of contents discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model  valuations performed by third parties  earnings multiples  or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques  including the forecasting of markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs and expenses  and multiple other factors 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made  however  the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
liabilities and expenses for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets  and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age  and mortality 
the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the interest rates available at year end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan 
the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of of is approximately and either a charge or credit of to after tax earnings in the following year 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated by considering expected returns on current asset allocations  which is supported by historical actual returns  and is generally applied to a five year average market value of assets 
a change in the assumption for the long term rate of return on plan assets of of would impact after tax earnings by approximately for in  the expected long term rate of return was reduced to due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the global economic downturn 
this was supported by the fact that for the first time in years in  the year moving average of actual performance fell below  even though the year moving average continued to exceed 
in  the year moving average of actual performance fell below for the first time in more than years  but has continued to exceed 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be in in  a net charge of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate  which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
in  a net charge of   after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of plan assets  which was somewhat offset by the decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation as a result of a basis point increase in the discount rate and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
additionally  in both and  a charge of was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 
stock based compensation 
alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non substantive vesting period approach  in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility  annual forfeiture rate  and exercise behavior 
these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
as part of alcoa s stock based compensation plan design  individuals who are retirement eligible have a six month requisite service period in the year of grant 
equity grants are issued in january each year 
as a result  a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first and second quarters of each year for these retirement eligible employees 
compensation expense recorded in   and was after tax  after tax  and after tax  respectively 
of this amount    and in   and  respectively  pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement eligible employees 
on december   alcoa accelerated the vesting of million unvested stock options granted to employees in and on january  the and accelerated options had weighted average exercise prices of and  respectively  and in the aggregate represented approximately of alcoa s total outstanding options 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of the and options was made primarily to avoid recognizing the 
table of contents related compensation expense in future earnings upon the adoption of a new accounting standard 
the accelerated vesting of the and stock options reduced alcoa s after tax stock option compensation expense in by plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options  stock awards  or a combination of both 
this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized 
related party transactions alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies  consisting of entities in which alcoa retains a or less equity interest  at negotiated arms length prices between the two parties
