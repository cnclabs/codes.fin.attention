critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which is regularly reviewed  is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable 
the allowance is determined based on historical write off experience and the current retailer environment 
balances over days past due and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability  other balances are considered on an aggregate basis considering the aging of balances 
account balances are written off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
management believes that the risk associated with trade accounts receivable is adequately provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
during the week period ended january   the company recorded reserves of approximately  and utilized  resulting in an aggregate reserve balance of  as of january  the company reserved  for such items as of december  this amount is included as part of the sales allowance reserve  which is provided in supplemental schedules on page f inventories 
our finished goods inventories at our retail stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in 
table of contents our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation  which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
inventories other than finished goods at retail stores  called production inventory  primarily consists of piece goods  trim and work in process 
it is the company s policy to value the production inventory  which makes up approximately of company s total inventory  at lower of cost or market value using first in first out valuation method 
the company reviews the inventory for factors such as age  obsolescence  potential use  or other factors that may indicate a decline in its value 
the company records a reserve against the cost of the production inventory to account for any decline in its value 
finite long lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and exceeds the fair market value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 
the company evaluates finite lived assets in accordance with impairment or disposal of long lived assets under topic property  plant and equipment of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc 
finite lived assets are evaluated for recoverability in accordance with topic of the fasb asc whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss  equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset is recognized 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
the company evaluated its finite lived assets during fiscal and and as a result  recorded an impairment charge of million for underperforming stores and million for underperforming stores  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the company evaluates its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with intangibles goodwill and other  topic of the fasb asc 
this guidance requires ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment 
the company performs impairment testing  which considers the company s fair value to determine whether an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the company s recorded goodwill and other intangible assets  associated with its avd reporting unit  is necessary 
this is reevaluated annually during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if necessary 
the company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the recorded goodwill will be recoverable 
factors used to determine this primarily include declines in stock price and the market capitalization in relation to the book value of the company  discounted projected cash flows of the reporting unit and valuation of companies comparable to the reporting unit 
during fiscal  the company did not incur an impairment charge against the carrying value of goodwill 
in fiscal  the continued instability of the united states economy resulted in the company experiencing decreased sales 
the company s stock price increased from its year end level and its book value approximates its market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium 
the company s impairment testing resulted in a fair value of equity for its avd reporting unit that exceeded its carrying value of equity by approximately million or of the carrying value of equity 
the company s discounted projected cash flows for its avd 
table of contents reporting unit assumes that  the performance of fiscal is significantly improved from fiscal with the second half of fiscal providing the majority of the expected improvement 
in the event that the company does not achieve its fiscal financial projections  an impairment charge to goodwill may occur 
an impairment charge of  was recorded against the carrying value of intangible assets associated with its wholesale division mary l  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  related to the discontinuance of mary l

self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims up to certain thresholds 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for fiscal  and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we maintain stop loss insurance coverage which covers us for benefits paid in excess of limits as defined in the plan 
gift cards  gift certificates and credits 
the company sells gift cards and gift certificates gift cards and issues credits to its customers when merchandise is returned merchandise credit  which do not expire 
the company recognizes sales from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer and income when the likelihood of the gift card and merchandise credit being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage  since the company has determined that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed value to the relevant jurisdiction as abandoned property 
the company determines gift card breakage income based upon historical redemption patterns and the remaining unredeemed percentage at the end of our historical data of years 
historical redemptions of gift cards ranged from in the first quarter to in the fourteenth quarter subsequent to the issue date  resulting in an average of approximately redeemed or unredeemed gift cards over the historical data of years 
we have determined that redemption would be remote based on the fact that  by the fourteenth quarter since issue date  the redemption rate approximated  indicating that the probability of such cards being redeemed is remote 
as such  we have recorded breakage income based upon this  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis for propriety 
breakage income represents the balance of gift cards and merchandise credit  for which the company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer  is remote 
at that time  the company will recognize breakage income for those gift cards and merchandise credit 
the company recorded breakage income of   and  during fiscal year ended  and  respectively

this provision prescribes a comprehensive model of how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
the provision also states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based upon its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
the cumulative effect of this adoption did not result in any adjustment in the company s liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
balance at december  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions for prior years reductions for tax positions for prior years due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations settlements balance at january  included in the above ending balance are tax positions of  which  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective tax rate

we began to return to historical trends in fiscal the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended january  we derived this data from our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for the construction of new stores and inventory for new stores  as well as the remodeling of existing stores 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
as of january   we had working capital of million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
the cash and marketable securities at january  included certificates of deposit of million  that have been placed by the company as collateral against a one year credit facility 
the following table sets forth our cash flows for the period indicated weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended december  december  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal  million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of million  an impairment charge of million against the carrying value of the company s intangible assets and assets related to underperforming stores  write off of the non compete agreement in connection with employee separation charge of  for separation agreements with two of its former executive officers  decrease in income tax receivable of million and million due to decrease in inventories  which are offset by amortization of deferred rent of million  deferred taxes of million and net loss of million 
inventories decreased due to company s efforts to better align inventory to the decreased sales volumes at stores 
income tax receivable decreased due to receipt of million from federal and state governments 
these decreases were offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  principally due to prepayment of january rent for the company s stores 
during fiscal  million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of million  a write down of equipment and leasehold improvements  net of deferred rent of million for underperforming stores  impairment charge of million for goodwill and assets related to stores and amortization of deferred rent for million 
the following also contributed to the million generated in cash from operating activities  a decrease in inventories of million  due to the company s conscious efforts to not maintain excess inventory due to the current economic crisis  offset by increases in receivables of million and decreases in accounts payable of million 
the increase in receivables was primarily due to an income tax receivable of million  due to the company s fiscal net loss  coupled with estimated tax payments made during fiscal and during fiscal  million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income  depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in inventories of million was primarily due to reduced inventory levels on hand in stores  a decrease in prepaid expenses of million was primarily due to a reduction in prepaid rents as compared to fiscal  an increase in accrued liabilities of million was primarily due to higher customer credits and share repurchase liability  as compared to fiscal and  from non cash stock based compensation expense  which were partially offset by an decrease in accounts payable of million  reversal of deferred rent of million was primarily from new store openings and a decrease in deferred income taxes of million was primarily due to timing of depreciation 

table of contents investing activities during fiscal used million  generated million during fiscal and used million during fiscal in fiscal  the company s investment cash flows decreased approximately million due to net purchases of marketable securities 
the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million for new and remodeled stores coupled with an increase in restricted certificates of deposit of million  also attributed to the decrease in cash flows from investing activities during fiscal our capital requirements depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal to fund new store openings and remodelings are approximately to million 
based on our experience with new store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open new stores is approximately  to  which includes new store opening expenses and initial inventory  net of landlord contributions 
we estimate that the average net investment to remodel an existing store is approximately  to  net of landlord contributions 
cash used by financing activities during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the usage of cash by financing activities during fiscal  and was primarily for the repurchase of our common stock in amounts of  million and million  respectively 
repayment of the company s note payable of million also contributed to the decrease during fiscal  and million and  during fiscal and  respectively 
the company s former credit line with bank of america  na the bank expired on march  subsequently  on may   the company entered into a one year credit facility with the bank 
under this facility  the company may direct the bank to issue letters of credit up to a total of  any outstanding letters of credit under this facility are collateralized by granting to the bank a security interest in various certificates of deposit held by the company and its subsidiaries with the bank  amounting to a total of  this one year credit facility will expire on may  the company is currently reviewing its future requirements for a credit facility and plans to initiate discussion with its bankers to renew this credit line or negotiate a new credit facility 
the company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately  and  at january  and december   respectively 
we believe that cash flow from operations and our current available cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital in the future
