vornado is the sole general partner of  and owned approximately of the common limited partnership interest in  the operating partnership at december  all references to we  us  our  the company and vornado refer to vornado realty trust and its consolidated subsidiaries  including the operating partnership 
we own and operate office  retail and showroom properties our core operations with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the new york city metropolitan area and in the washington  dc northern virginia areas 
in addition  we have a interest in toys r us  inc toys which has a significant real estate component  a interest in alexander s  inc  which has seven properties in the greater new york metropolitan area  as well as interests in other real estate and related investments 
on may   our board of trustees executed its long planned management succession strategy and elected michael d 
fascitelli  as our chief executive officer  succeeding steven roth  who continues to serve as chairman of the board 
our business objective is to maximize shareholder value  which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders 
below is a table comparing our performance to that of the morgan stanley reit index rms and the snl reit index snl for the following periods ending december  past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance total return vornado rms snl one year three years five years ten years past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future 
we intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit  investing in properties in select markets  such as new york city and washington  dc  where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation  acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents  investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the new york city metropolitan area  investing in fully integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component  and developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value 
we expect to finance our growth  acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds  proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets 
we may also determine to raise capital for future real estate acquisitions through an institutional investment fund 
we would serve as the general partner of the fund and would also expect to be a limited partner of the fund and have the potential to earn certain incentives based on the fund s performance 
the fund may serve as our exclusive investment vehicle for a limited period of time for all investments that fit within the fund s investment parameters 
if we determine to raise capital through a fund  the partnership interests offered would not be registered under the securities act of and could not be offered or sold in the united state s absent registration under that act or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements 
overview continued we compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers  some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments 
principal factors of competition are rents charged  attractiveness of location  the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national  regional and local economies  the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
see risk factors in item a for additional information regarding these factors 
the economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the financial and capital markets have negatively affected substantially all businesses  including ours 
demand for office and retail space has declined nationwide due to bankruptcies  downsizing  layoffs and cost cutting 
real estate transactions and development opportunities have significantly curtailed and capitalization rates have risen 
these trends have negatively impacted our and financial results  which include losses associated with abandoned development projects  valuation allowances on investments in mezzanine loans and impairments on other real estate investments 
the details of these non cash charges are described below 
impairment losses and valuation allowances are based on our estimates of the amounts we may ultimately realize upon disposition 
the estimation pro cess is inherently uncertain and is based upon  among other factors  our expectations of future events  and accordingly  actual amounts received on these investments could differ materially from our estimates 
it is not possible for us to quantify the impact of the above trends  which may continue in and beyond  on our future financial results

overview continued financings in april  we sold  common shares  including underwriters over allotment  in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of  after underwriters discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for  class a units of the operating partnership 
on september   we completed a public offering of  principal amount of callable senior unsecured year notes nyse vnod due october  the notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option  in whole or in part  beginning in october at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
these notes contain financial covenants  including limitations on outstanding debt and minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
we received net proceeds of approximately  from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes 
during  we purchased  aggregate face amount of our convertible senior debentures and  aggregate face amount of our senior unsecured notes for  and  in cash  respectively 
this debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired 
we also repaid  of existing property level debt and completed  of property level financings 
in connection with the above  we recognized an aggregate net loss of  from the early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of income 
dispositions on september   we sold k street  a newly developed  square foot office building  in washington s central business district  for  in cash  which resulted in a net gain of  which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations  on our consolidated statement of income 
during  we sold retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of  in cash  which resulted in net gains aggregating  which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations  on our consolidated statement of income 
mezzanine loans receivable on june   we were repaid the entire  balance of the charles square hotel loan including accrued interest 
this loan was scheduled to mature in september on january   we were repaid the entire  balance of the equinox loan including accrued interest 
this loan  which we acquired in for  was scheduled to mature in february overview continued leasing activity the following table sets forth certain information for the properties we own directly or indirectly  including leasing activity 
the leasing activity presented below is based on leases signed during the period and is not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue recognition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
tenant improvements and leasing commissions are presented below based on square feet leased during the period  on a per square foot and per square foot per annum basis based on weighted average lease terms and as a percentage of initial rent per square foot

in addition  the new york office segment leased square feet of retail space during the year ended december  at an average initial rent of  a increase over the prior escalated rent per square foot 
under gaap  acquired below market leases are marked to market at the time of their acquisition 
accordingly  when the space is subsequently re leased  the cash basis rent increase is greater than the gaap basis rent increase 
overview continued impact of retrospective application of new accounting pronouncements during  we paid quarterly dividends to our common shareholders in a combination of cash and stock and retrospectively adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding in the computations of income and ffo per share to include the additional common shares resulting from these dividends in the earliest periods presented in each of our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march   june  and september  and our current report on form k  issued on october   in which we elected to recast our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k a amendment no 
for the year ended december  on december   the fasb ratified the consensus reached in eitf e  accounting for distribution to shareholders with componen ts of stock and cash eitf e as codified through accounting standards update asu to asc  equity 
eitf e requires an entity to include the additional common shares resulting from the stock portion of these distributions prospectively in the periods following their issuance in all computations of income per share rather than retrospectively as we had previously done 
as a result  we have adjusted all of our computations of income and ffo per share presented herein to exclude the additional shares resulting from these dividends in periods prior to their issuance 
below is a reconciliation of previously reported income and ffo per share to the amounts presented herein 
for the year ended december  as reported eitf e as adjusted income per common share basic income from continuing operations net income income per common share diluted income from continuing operations net income ffo attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions per diluted share for the year ended december  as reported eitf e as adjusted income per common share basic income from continuing operations net income income per common share diluted income from continuing operations net income overview continued on january   we adopted the provisions of asc  debt with conversion and other options  which was required to be applied retrospectively 
the adoption affected the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures by requiring the initial proceeds from their sale to be allocated between a debt component and an equity component in a manner that results in interest expense on the debt component at our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the date of issue 
the initial debt components of our billion convertible senior debentures  billion convertible senior debentures and million exchangeable senior debentures were   and  respectively  based on the fair value of similar nonconvertible instruments issued at that time 
the aggregate initial debt discount of  after original issuance costs allocated to the equity component was recorded in additional capital in our consolidated statement of changes in equity 
the discount is amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding ie  the earliest date the holders may require us to repurchase the debentures  which resulted in  and  of additional interest expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc  consolidation  which requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements 
it also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation 
the amended guidance became effective on january  and resulted in i the reclassification of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiarie s  a component of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets  ii the reclassification of minority interest expense to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  on our consolidated statements of income  and iii additional disclosures  including a consolidated statement of changes in equity in quarterly reporting periods 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc  business combinations  which applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
it also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and interests transferred as a result of business combinations  and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition 
the amended guidance also expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
the amended guidance b ecame effective for all transactions entered into on or after january  the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements because there have been no acquisitions during in march  the fasb issued an update to asc  derivatives and hedging  which requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities  including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
it also provided a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock 
the amended guidance became effective on january  the adoption of this guidance on januar y  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an update to asc  earnings per share  which requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as participating securities and include such securities in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method as described in asc the amended guidance became effective on january  and required all prior period earnings per share data presented  to be adjusted retroactively 
the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have a material effect on our computation of income per share 
in april  the fasb issued an amendment to the guidance for other than temporary impairments otti of investments in debt securities  which changes the presentation of otti in financial statements 
under this guidance  if an otti debt security is intended to be sold or required to be sold prior to the recovery of its carrying amount  the full amount of the impairment loss is charged to earnings 
otherwise  losses on debt securities must be separated into two categories  the portion which is considered credit loss  which is charged to earnings  and the portion due to other factors  which is charged to other comprehensive income loss  a component of balance sheet equity 
when an unrealized loss on a fixed maturity security is not considered otti  the unrealized loss continues to be charged to other comprehensive income loss and not to earn ings 
the adoption of this guidance on april  did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an update to asc  consolidation  which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary  based on whether the entity has i power over the significant activities of the vie  and ii an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie 
the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  were billion and billion  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors  including historical operating results  known trends and market economic conditions 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on our current plans  intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  anticipated holding periods or market conditions change  our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses 
identified intangibles as of december  and  the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets including acquired above market leases  tenant relationships and acquired in place leases  a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities  a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
identified intangibles are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date  separate and apart from goodwill 
identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset  including related real estate  if appropriate  is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
if intangible assets are impaired or estimated useful lives change  the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 
critical accounting policies continued mezzanine loans receivable we invest in mezzanine loans to entities that have significant real estate assets 
these investments  which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property  are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate 
we record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable  net were  and  respectively 
we accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method  or straight line method if the result is not materially different 
we evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans each quarter  if circumstances warrant  in determining whether they are impaired 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or  as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if our estimates of the collectibility of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
partially owned entities as of december  and  the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities  including alexander s and toys r us  were billion and billion  respectively 
in determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  we consider factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  or receive a majority of the expected residual returns  if they occur  or both 
we account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions 
investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method 
our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment each quarter  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
 the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  and  as of december  and  respectively 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straigh t line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon sales of the tenants exceeding defined thresholds 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenue income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue 
income is recognized when rooms are occupied 
food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered 
trade shows revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows  including rentals of booths 
this revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
management  leasing and other fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities 
this revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
before we recognize revenue  we assess  among other things  its collectibility 
if our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
we distribute to our shareholders of our taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders  or fail to meet other reit requirements  we may fail to qualify as a reit which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences

net income and ebitda by segment for the years ended december   and continued notes to the preceding tabular information ebitda represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we consider ebitda a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity 
as properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of ebitda  we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows and may not be c omparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

our debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non recourse to us  senior unsecured notes  exchangeable senior debentures  convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance 
although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements  we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
further  if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio 
other commitments and contingencies our mortgage loans are non recourse to us 
however  in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space 
these guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans 
as of december   the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately  at december    of letters of credit were outstanding under our billion revolving credit facility 
our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios  and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below baa bbb 
our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing  including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment  including such items as failure to pay interest or principal 
each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times 
the environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination 
however  there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination  changes in the extent or known scope of contamination  the discovery of additional sites  or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us 
we are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately  of this amount   is committed to the india property fund and is pledged as collateral to its lender 
liquidity and capital resources continued litigation we are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
in our opinion  after consultation with legal counsel  the outcome of such matters  including the matters referred to below  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on january   stop shop filed a complaint with the united states district court for the district of new jersey usdc nj claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the  of annual rent from stop shop pursuant to the master agreement and guaranty  because of the expiration of the east brunswick  jersey city  middletown  union and woodbridge leases to which the  of additional rent was previously allocated 
stop shop asserted that a prior order of the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york dated february   as modified on appeal to the district court for the southern district of new york on february   froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from stop shop 
on march   after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction  stop shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint 
on march   stop shop filed a new complaint in new york state supreme court  asserting substantially the same claims as in its usdc nj complaint 
we removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
in january that court remanded the action to the new york state supreme court 
on february   we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that stop shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the master agreement and guaranty remain in effect 
on may   we filed a motion for summary judgment 
on july   stop shop opposed our motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment 
on december   the court issued its decision denying the mo tions for summary judgment 
both parties appealed the court s decision and on december   the appellate court division issued a decision affirming the court s decision 
on january   we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the appellate court s decision which was denied on march  discovery is now complete 
on october   stop shop filed a motion for leave to amend its pleadings to assert new claims for relief  including a claim for damages in an unspecified amount  and an additional affirmative defense 
the motion was argued and submitted for decision on december  the course of future proceedings will depend upon the outcome of stop shop s motion  but we anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in we intend to vigorously pursue our claims against stop shop 
in our opinion  after consultation with legal counsel  the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on may   we acquired a controlling interest in avenue of the americas and the california street complex 
our interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own  through us entities  the sole general partnership interest and a limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties 
the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by donald j 
trump 
in august  mr 
trump brought a lawsuit in the new york state supreme court against  among others  the general partners of the partnerships referred to above relating to a dispute over the sale of properties located on the former penn central rail yards between west th and nd streets in manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships 
in decisions iss ued in  and  the new york state supreme court dismissed all of mr 
trump s claims  and those decisions were affirmed by the appellate division 
mr 
trump cannot further appeal those decisions 
in july  we acquired h street building corporation h street which has a subsidiary that owns  among other things  a tenancy in common interest in land located in arlington county  virginia  known as pentagon row  leased to two tenants 
in april  h street acquired the remaining interest in that fee 
in april  we received letters from those tenants  street retail  inc and post apartment homes  lp  claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions 
on september   both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners 
the claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest  damages in excess of  and punitive damages 
we believe this claim is without merit and regardless of merit  in our opinion  after consultation with legal counsel  this c laim will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

nareit defines ffo as gaap net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets and gaap extraordinary items  and to include depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non cash items  including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales  which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate dimin ishes predictably over time  rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure
