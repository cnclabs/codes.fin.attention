overview we sell a family of proxy and other appliances  and related software and services 
our appliances  together with our software  secure and optimize the delivery of business applications  web content and other information over a wide area network wan or across an enterprise s internet gateway 
our products are based on three core functionalities security of the delivery of applications and content  acceleration and optimization of the delivery of applications and content  and visibility of the applications  content and users on the network 
while our products are frequently sold and used individually  many of our product and service offerings share a common architecture and work together as part of an application delivery network infrastructure 
the combined offering enables distributed enterprises with multiple offices and geographically decentralized employees to more efficiently and effectively use and secure their critical business applications and networks 
in fiscal  we evolved our business strategy to include offering the core functionality of our products to new markets and through new delivery models and strategic relationships 
we reorganized our product oriented and development resources into product groups to support this strategy 
we continue to refine those organizations to better serve our strategy and to better address specific markets  such as the telecommunications carrier market and the mid market for secure web gateway products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we released two new products our cacheflow appliance  which is a wan optimization appliance targeted specifically for the telecommunications carrier market  and our proxysg virtual appliance  which is a software based wan optimization appliance designed to run as a virtual image on industry standard servers  targeted for large and mid sized customers 
during fiscal  we also focused on improving our operational efficiency and cost structure  implemented a global restructuring plan and revised our global logistics practices 
we initiated our global 
table of contents restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal this plan included a net reduction of approximately of our then current headcount and the closure of three of our smaller remote product development facilities 
the total estimated restructuring costs associated with the plan are million  and we recognized substantially all of these costs by the end of fiscal the revision of our global logistics practices commenced in the first quarter of fiscal and was completed during the fiscal year 
we now ship all of our products directly to end user customers or value added resellers from one of two regional logistics centers  rather than using stocking distributors 
this change has reduced shipping costs for us and for our channel partners and has shortened delivery times 
we measure the success of our collective efficiency and cost reduction efforts in substantial part by our operating margin and cash flow from operations 
as discussed below  we saw improvement in both of these financial metrics during the course of the fiscal year 
while we were successful in increasing operating profitability in the second half of fiscal  many factors can impact our future performance  including the global economic environment  seasonality and our ability to balance those activities that are necessary to drive future growth while controlling current operating costs 
at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced difficulty in closing sales transactions in our emea geographic region  which typically accounts for over of our net revenue 
we believe that this may have resulted from the current macroeconomic challenges in europe 
we expect that such challenges may continue in the first quarter of fiscal  and possibly longer  resulting in longer sales cycles in europe during that period 
in addition  because our quota carrying sales force is on an annual sales compensation plan  with year end accelerators to encourage the closing of sales in the fourth fiscal quarter  we expect that our revenue during the first quarter of fiscal may also be negatively affected by seasonality 
although we intend to continue to focus on our operational efficiency  cost structure and profitability in fiscal  we also are selectively investing in activities that we believe will drive future growth of our business 
we presently are focused on growing our business through four key initiatives increasing sales of our secure web gateway products to large enterprises through cross selling to channel partners and assisting end user customers to implement more comprehensive and robust secure web gateway solutions to protect their network investments  increasing sales of our wan optimization products to those end user customers seeking acceleration of e mail and storage  increasing sales in the telecommunications carrier market  particularly in areas of the world where bandwidth is relatively limited and expensive  and developing and delivering a cloud based services offering  initially directed at providing secure web gateway services  particularly to mid market customers 
during fiscal  we intend to invest in these and other initiatives that we believe will enhance our growth and increase our market penetration while continuing to focus on increased operating profitability and cash flow from operations 
we track many financial metrics as key measures of our business performance  including net revenue  operating margin  deferred revenue  cash flow from operations and cash position 
net revenue net revenue  which includes product and service revenue  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net product revenue in fiscal was million  a million increase compared with fiscal  due to an increased demand for our products  which we believe primarily resulted 
table of contents from improved economic conditions and increased enterprise it spending 
net product revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our proxysg and packetshaper appliances and licenses to our webfilter product 
we recognized million in service revenue in fiscal  a million increase compared with fiscal the increase in service revenue was driven primarily by an increase in revenue from new and renewal service contracts 
operating margin our operating income increased million to million in fiscal compared with fiscal this increase was attributable to both an increase in net revenue discussed above and an increase in our gross profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by restructuring charges of million and higher research and development expenses in fiscal the year over year gross margin increase resulted from both  a favorable product mix and decreased product discounting  and decreased impact from the application of fair value purchase accounting on packeteer inventory and deferred revenue  which negatively impacted the cost of net revenue and service revenue by million in total in fiscal compared with a negative impact of million in total in fiscal at april   million of the fair value write down on packeteer s deferred service revenue remained to be recognized and the fair value write up of packeteer inventory was fully recognized 
excluding the fair value purchase accounting impact on gross profit in these two fiscal periods  gross profit margin in fiscal would have been approximately basis points higher than that in fiscal  primarily as a result of favorable changes in product mix and decreased product discounting 
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and restructuring charges 
personnel related costs  including stock based compensation  are the primary driver of the operating expenses in each functional area 
as of april  and we had  and  full time equivalent employees  respectively 
the april  headcount included employees acquired in the s acquisition 
deferred revenue net deferred revenue was million at april  compared with million at april  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in the sales of renewal service contracts to our customers  including an increase in long term service contracts sold with our appliances  partially offset by million decrease in deferred revenue related to the elimination of stocking shipments to our distributors who previously carried inventory  as a result of our change to a direct fulfillment model 
at april   our transition to a direct fulfillment model was complete 
cash flow from operations and cash position during fiscal  we generated cash flow from operations of million compared with million generated during fiscal the increase in operating cash flow in fiscal was primarily driven by higher net income after excluding the impact of non cash charges such as stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by lower working capital sources of cash in the current fiscal year and increased deferred revenue 
our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were million at april  compared with million at april  the overall increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance was primarily due to higher cash generated by operations and net proceeds from issuance of common stock 
the increased proceeds from issuance of common stock were driven primarily by an increase in stock option exercises in the current fiscal year due to the increase in our stock price in the current fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  supply chain liabilities and valuation of inventory  acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  income taxes  and legal and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 
we have discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments that materially affect our financial statements and that are critical to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts stock based compensation supply chain liabilities and valuation of inventory acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets income taxes legal and other contingencies revenue recognition we sell a family of proxy and other appliances  and related software and services 
we operate a multiple tier channel distribution model that includes both distributors and value added resellers 
in most cases  we sell our products to distributors  who in turn sell to value added resellers and ultimately end users 
in these cases  we ship our products from our fulfillment centers to value added resellers who provide configuration services for the end users 
in some cases  we sell directly to value added resellers  who in turn sell to end users 
in these cases  we ship our products from our fulfillment centers directly to end users 
we do not accept orders from distributors or value added resellers when we are aware that they do not have an order from an end user 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades  on a when and if available basis  through maintenance contracts for most of our products 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we define each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor or value added reseller agreement and  in limited cases  an end user agreement 
delivery or performance has occurred 
we use shipping and related documents  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance 
we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which generally is upon shipment to distributors  value added resellers and end users 
we generally do not have significant obligations for future performance  such as rights of return or pricing credits  associated with our sales 

table of contents the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection on a customer by customer basis 
we subject our customers to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for our products and services 
if we conclude that collection is not probable based upon our initial review  we do not recognize revenue until cash is received 
for arrangements that include multiple elements  such as appliances  maintenance or software  we use the residual method to recognize revenue for the delivered elements 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements  provided that vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we analyze our stand alone maintenance renewals by stratification of sales channel and service offering 
we determine the vsoe of fair value for maintenance by analyzing our stand alone maintenance renewals and noting that a substantial majority of transactions fall within a narrow range for each stratum 
in limited cases  vsoe of fair value has been based on management determined prices 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized at the earlier of delivery of those elements or establishment of fair value for the remaining undelivered elements 
when vsoe of fair value cannot be determined for any undelivered maintenance  subscription or service element  revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance  subscription or service period 
maintenance and subscription revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract  with the related expenses recognized as incurred 
maintenance and subscription contracts usually have a term of one to three years 
unearned maintenance and subscription revenue is included in deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue from the sale of third party anti virus software net of royalties paid and classify this revenue as net service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer geographic concentrations  customer solvency  current economic and geographic trends  and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of such allowance  and record any required changes in the allowance account to general and administrative expense 
we write off accounts receivable when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
stock based compensation effective may   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of accounting standards codification asc no 
 compensation stock compensation  asc  formerly fasb statement no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense recognized beginning on that date include a compensation expense for all unvested share based payments granted prior to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fasb statement  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate compensation expense 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of options  the expected price volatility of the stock underlying such options  the risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend yield 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to 
table of contents vest and to reduce compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest 
supply chain liabilities and valuation of inventory we outsource our manufacturing  product fulfillment and repair operations to contract manufacturers and third party logistics providers  and a significant portion of our cost of net revenue results from these activities 
our contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on demand forecasts that we prepare 
these forecasts are based on estimates of future product demand and are adjusted for overall market conditions 
if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted  we may be required to write down our inventory or accrue for excess supply chain liability  which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market  after obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand is considered 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand  last time buy decisions  the timing of new product introductions  economic trends and market conditions 
acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
goodwill is measured as a residual as of the acquisition date  which in most cases  results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including any contingent consideration 
it further requires acquisition related costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  restructuring costs to be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period to impact the provision for income taxes 
in addition  acquired in process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on significant judgments made by management 
we typically engage third party valuation appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of the assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and also include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows to be earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
acquisition related identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives  which are three to seven years for developed technology and patents  five years for core technology  four to seven years for customer relationships and two years for trade name 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually during our fourth fiscal quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred  and the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
an impairment of goodwill is recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires the application of significant judgment 
for purposes of the annual impairment test  we consider our market capitalization compared with the carrying amount of our net assets on the date of the test  since we have only one reporting unit 
we performed our annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that no impairment existed at april  
table of contents we evaluate long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value as calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our income tax expense and calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of the amortization of certain intangible assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to an amount that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will be realized by either refundable income taxes or future taxable income  the valuation allowance will be reduced and the related tax impact will be recorded as a reduction to the tax provision in that period 
likewise  should we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be recorded as an increase to the tax provision in the period in which such determination was made 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and conflicting tax laws and regulations  as well as multinational tax conventions 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  the availability of tax credits and carryforwards  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  and the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
consequently  tax authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
we review our uncertain tax benefits quarterly  and we may adjust such uncertain tax benefits as a consequence of proposed assessments by tax authorities  changes in facts and circumstances  issuance of new regulations or new case law  previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination  negotiations with tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer pricing  resolution with respect to individual audit issues audit years  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
in addition  our tax contingency reserve includes certain amounts for potential tax assessments for pre acquisition tax years of acquired companies  which  if recognized  will be recorded to our provision for income taxes 
legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis 
we record a charge equal to at least the 
table of contents minimum estimated liability for damages arising from litigation or other loss contingencies only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending loss contingencies and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenue  consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated year ended april  net revenue product service total net revenue cost of net revenue product service total cost of net revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense other expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss net revenue net revenue consists of product and service revenue 
net product revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our proxysg and packetshaper appliances and licenses to our webfilter product 
net service revenue primarily consists of sales of new and renewal service contracts and sales of third party software 
although it is generally our practice to promptly ship products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders based on our published shipping lead times  we occasionally have orders that have not shipped or have otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition at the end of the quarter 
in some of these cases  we may exercise discretion over the timing of shipments  which affects the timing of revenue recognition for those orders 
in such cases  we consider a number of factors  including our operational capacity to fulfill orders at the end of 
table of contents the quarter  our published shipment lead times  the delivery dates requested by customers and resellers  the effect of the related revenue on our business plan  the amount of orders shipped in the quarter  and the concentration of orders received at the end of the quarter 
the following is a summary of net revenue and the changes in net revenue by fiscal year year ended april  dollars in thousands total net revenue change from prior fiscal year change from prior fiscal year fiscal compared with fiscal net revenue  which includes product and service revenue  increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal net product revenue in fiscal was million  a million increase compared with fiscal  due to increased demand for our products  which we believe primarily resulted from an improvement in the economic environment and enterprise it spending

fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was consistent with the increase in net revenue 
gross profit margin in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal  primarily attributable to costs associated with acquired packeteer products  including million associated with the sale of inventory that had been written up to fair value  million of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  and a million write down of deferred service revenue to fair value  all as required by purchase accounting rules

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize all remaining federal and state deferred tax assets  other than capital loss carryforwards and certain tax assets including net operating losses and tax credits in the state of california due to current earnings and projections of future profits 
accordingly  the company released the valuation allowance against million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recognized an additional million of deferred tax assets during the current fiscal year which primarily related to the utilization of previously unbenefitted tax attributes to offset current taxable income in the us in addition  there were reductions in the valuation allowance of million that did not impact tax expense primarily related to adjustments of deferred tax assets associated with the reversals of temporary differences and the reduction of california deferred tax assets that will not be available in the future as a result of changes in california tax law that will impact the company s ability to utilize the assets

we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date based on our intent and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
to date  all of our short term investments have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  excluding the portion relating to credit loss  if any  included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
the fair value of these securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets

fiscal compared with fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  we had significantly higher net income after excluding the impact of non cash charges such as stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by lower working capital sources of cash compared to the prior fiscal year 
net working capital sources of cash resulted from higher cash collections  higher accrued liabilities and higher deferred revenue 
higher cash collections were reflected by our decrease in days sales outstanding from at april  to at april  the increase in deferred revenue was a result of an increase in both new and renewal service contracts 
accrued liabilities increased primarily due to an increase in long term income taxes payable as a result of our significantly higher net income in the current fiscal year

fiscal compared with fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared with million in the comparable prior fiscal year period 
the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher cash collections  reflected by our days sales outstanding decreasing from days at april  to days at april  these increases were partially offset by lower net income and certain payments made related to our packeteer acquisition  including transaction costs  severance payments and other liabilities assumed as a result of the packeteer acquisition

contractual obligations below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations as of april  year ended april  thereafter total in thousands convertible senior notes future minimum operating lease payments purchase obligations and other commitments total we lease certain office equipment and office facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through the facility leases generally require us to pay operating costs  including property taxes  insurance and maintenance  and contain scheduled rent increases and certain other rent escalation clauses 
rent expense is recognized in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases after consideration of rent holidays and improvement allowances  if applicable 
any assets purchased using a lessee improvement allowance are capitalized as fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the lease term 
at april   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million 
due to uncertainties with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm  noncancelable  and unconditional commitments 
in 
table of contents certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
these agreements are enforceable and legally binding against us in the short term and all amounts under these arrangements are due to be paid by the end of fiscal as of april  our total purchase commitments for inventory were million 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities  nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including changes in exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposures to exchange and interest rate risks  and we are not a party to any risk management transactions 
we also do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for hedging  speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million 
these amounts were primarily held in money market funds 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which is intended to enhance the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates  given the short term nature of the majority of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we primarily develop products in the united states and sell them throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign markets 
since all of our sales are currently invoiced and collected in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could potentially make our products less price competitive in foreign markets 
as a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings are derived from international operations  this could adversely affect our net revenue and earnings 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately   and  respectively  of our total net revenue was derived from customers outside of the americas 
in contrast  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies  which to date have constituted an insignificant portion of our total operating expenses 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the foreign currency translation risk associated with our international operations has been material in the past and could be material in the future
