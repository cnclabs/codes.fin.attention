in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate streamline health s proprietary software 
the company licenses these software products  and pays the required license fees when such software is delivered to customers 
employees as of january   streamline health had full time employees  a net increase of during the fiscal year 
the company utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff  as needed 
none of company s employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good 
key personnel streamline health s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management  sales and technical personnel 
streamline health must recruit  motivate and retain highly skilled managers  sales force  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants and system architects skilled in the technical environments in which streamline health s systems operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse impact on the company 
regulatory matters the us department of health and human services hhs asked the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences to design a standardized model of an electronic health record  in a move that may help spur nationwide acceptance of ehr s 
the impact of such a change  if implemented by hhs  on current streamline health systems and services is unknown at this time 
however  streamline health believes that its systems are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing regulatory requirements 
patient privacy is of utmost concern  as evidenced by current hipaa regulations 
streamline health s systems enable a healthcare organization to lock down protected health information  as defined by hipaa  by preventing unauthorized access and providing audit trails for every occurrence of access to phi 
regulations relating to confidentiality federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of protected health information phi 
regulations governing electronic health data privacy are continuing to evolve 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of phi 
the legislation requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of phi 
regulations adopted pursuant to hipaa include rules addressing several areas 
the privacy rule also extended the scope of enforcement to phi residing on non electronic media  such as paper  as well as to email  oral and written communications 
streamline health cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently issued regulations 
additionally  legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the state level 
these laws or regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate phi 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of streamline health s systems are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of software and adversely affect the licensing of streamline health s software 
overall  streamline health believes the hipaa regulations will continue to stimulate healthcare organizations to purchase computer based ehr systems that automate the collection  use  and disclosure of phi  while maintaining appropriate security and audit controls over the information 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of streamline health software and services will occur 
limited protection of proprietary technology the success of streamline health depends on the protection of its intellectual property rights relating to its proprietary technology 
streamline health relies on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure  license  employment agreements  trade secret laws  copyrights  and restrictions on the disclosure of its intellectual property 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to streamline health s products 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend streamline health s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
streamline health could also be required to defend itself against claims made by third parties for intellectual property right infringement 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
item a risk factors see also  part i  item  business 
the following is a list of risk factors that affect the company 
they are not listed in any particular order or relative importance and no inferences should be given to the listing order 
in addition  risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company  its financial condition and or operating results 
the variability of the company s quarterly operating results can be significant 
the company s operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past  and the company may experience continued fluctuations in the future 
future revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include the relatively large size of customer agreements  unpredictability in the number and timing of system sales and sales of applications hosting services  length of the sales cycle  delays in installations  changes in customers financial condition or budgets  increased competition  the development and introduction of new products and services  the loss of significant customers or remarketing partners  changes in government regulations  particularly as to the healthcare industry  the size and growth of the overall healthcare information technology markets  any liability and other claims that may be asserted against the company  the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  national and local general economic and market conditions  and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this form k and any other filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
the company s revenues have been concentrated in a relatively small number of large customers  and the company has historically derived a substantial percentage of its total revenues from a few customers 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition to direct sales  the company relies on third party remarketing alliances for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the company seeks to expand its distribution channels by creating remarketing alliances with third parties who are engaged in the sale of healthcare information systems  medical records management and outsourcing  and other healthcare information technology and patient care solutions 
ge healthcare and telus health  the company s major remarketing partners  could choose to discontinue reselling streamline health products  and significant customers could elect to discontinue using the company s products 
the company needs to ensure that it expands its distribution channels to reduce the reliance on a single major reseller 
the company could be less profitable than expected 
because of the relatively fixed operating expenses and overhead  the future profitability of the company is dependent on increasing revenues which may not materialize as anticipated 
because of the company s anticipated shift in strategic focus towards remote application hosting services  upon obtaining new application hosting customers  the company will have to expend a significant amount of costs and time before those new customers are able to begin using such services and the company cannot begin to recognize revenues from those clients until the commencement of such services 
accordingly  the company anticipates that its near term cash flow  revenue and profitability may be adversely affected by this shift in strategic focus until new hosting customers go into production 
while the company anticipates long term growth through increases in recurring subscription fees and significantly improved profit visibility  the company s failure to successfully implement its focus on building its application hosting services business  or the failure of such initiative to result in improved profitability  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
the company needs to manage its costs while planning for growth 
the company is currently experiencing a period of growth primarily through its remote application hosting line of business and this could continue to place a significant strain on the company s cash flow 
this could also strain the services and support operations  sales and administrative personnel and other resources as they are requested to handle the added work load with existing support resources 
streamline health believes that it must continue to focus on these remote hosting services  develop new products  enhance existing solutions and serve the needs of its existing and anticipated customer base 
the company s ability to successfully maintain and expand its operations will depend  in large part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
the company s ability to manage its planned growth effectively also will require the company to continue to improve its operational  management  and financial systems and controls  to train  motivate  and manage its employees and to judiciously manage its operating expenses in anticipation of increased future revenues 
the potential impact on the company of new or changes in existing federal  state  and local regulations governing healthcare information could be substantial 
healthcare regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse affect on the company s business 
however  the company cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently existing regulations and which could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of its existing solutions are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations  but there can be no assurances 
while provisions in the american recovery and reinvestment act of may increase the demand for healthcare information technology  including the solutions offered by the company  such laws and regulations may have adverse consequences on the company 
legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the federal and state level including  but not limited to  the healthcare initiatives set forth in the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill signed into law by president obama on february  notwithstanding that the stimulus bill places substantial emphasis on the modernization of the us healthcare system by using healthcare information technology  with a primary focus on electronic medical records  the company s ability to benefit from such initiatives is uncertain at this time 
the implementation of the provisions in the stimulus bill may create new requirements for healthcare information technology that would require the company to incur additional research and development expenditures to modify or expand its solutions in order to be fully compliant 
in addition  until it becomes more clear how the government will apply its anticipated substantial funding of these healthcare initiatives  hospitals and other healthcare providers may delay purchases of new solutions until additional details become known 
in such event  the company may experience delays in entering into new agreements with existing customers and potential new customers 
the substantial sums of money contemplated by the stimulus bill to be spent on healthcare information technology further may increase competition by attracting new and financially stronger entities to this industry 
while provisions in the patient protection and affordable care act may increase the demand for healthcare information technology  including the solutions offered by the company  such laws and regulations may have adverse consequences on the company 
legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the federal and state level including  but not limited to  the healthcare initiatives set forth in the patient protection and affordable care act the health care bill signed into law by president obama on march  notwithstanding that the health care bill places substantial emphasis on the expansion of health care coverage to million currently uninsured americans  and introduces a significant amount of new rules and regulations affecting the complete continuum of care  the company s ability to benefit from such initiatives is uncertain at this time 
the implementation of the provisions in the health care bill may create new requirements for healthcare information technology that would require the company to incur additional research and development expenditures to modify or expand its solutions in order to be fully compliant with any new regulations  or compete with other vendors 
in addition  until it becomes clearer how the new rules and regulations will affect the administration  insurance and technology aspects of the delivery system  care providers may delay purchases of new solutions until additional details become known 
in such event  the company may experience delays in entering into new agreements with existing customers and potential new customers 
streamline health faces significant competition  including from companies with significantly greater resources 
the company currently competes with many other companies for the licensing of similar software solutions and related services 
several companies historically have dominated the clinical information systems software market and several of these companies have either acquired  developed or are developing their own document management and workflow technologies 
the industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively 
many of these companies are larger than streamline health and have significantly more resources to invest in their business 
in addition  information and document management companies serving other industries may enter the market 
suppliers and companies with whom streamline health may establish strategic alliances may also compete with streamline health 
such companies and vendors may either individually  or by forming alliances excluding streamline health  place bids for large agreements in competition with streamline health 
a decision on the part of any of these competitors to focus additional resources in the image enabling  workflow  and other markets addressed by streamline health could have a material adverse effect on streamline health 
the healthcare industry is evolving rapidly  which may make it more difficult for the company to be competitive in the future 
the us healthcare system is under intense pressure to improve in many areas  including modernization  universal access and controlling skyrocketing costs of care 
streamline health believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are customer recommendations and references  company reputation  system reliability  system features and functionality including ease of use  technological advancements  customer service and support  breadth and quality of the systems  the potential for enhancements and future compatible products  the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts  price and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor 
in addition  the company believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that streamline health will be able to keep pace with changing conditions and new developments such that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors 
rapid technology changes and short product life cycles could harm streamline health s business 
the market for streamline health s solutions and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  regulatory requirements  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing solutions obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  streamline health s position in the healthcare information technology market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon the company s ability to enhance its existing solutions and services and to develop and introduce new solutions and services to meet changing requirements 
the company needs to maintain an ongoing research and development program to continue to develop new solutions and apply new technologies to its existing products  but may not have sufficient funds with which to undertake such required research and development 
if the company is not able to foresee changes and or to react in a timely manner to such developments  the company may experience a material  adverse impact on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
streamline health s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of streamline health s solutions and services 
the company trademarks and copyrights its intellectual property  which represents an important asset to the company 
streamline health does not have any patent protection on any of its software 
the company relies upon license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc 
to maintain the confidentiality of streamline health s proprietary information and trade secrets 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to streamline health s products 
if the company fails to adequately protect the intellectual property through trademarks and copyrights  license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc  the intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated  or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate the company s technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technology advantage the company may have 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend streamline health s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
due to the rapid pace of technology change  the company believes its future success is likely to depend upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of our property rights 
however  the company has in the past  and intends in the future  to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary 
the company could be subjected to claims of intellectual property infringement  which claims could be expensive to defend 
while the company does not believe that its products and services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  the potential for intellectual property infringement claims continually increases as the number of software patents and copyrighted and trademarked materials continues to rapidly expand 
any claim for intellectual property right infringement  even if not meritorious  would be expensive to defend 
if the company were to become liable for infringing third party intellectual property rights  the company could be liable for substantial damage awards  and potentially be required to cease using the technology  to produce non infringing technology  or to obtain a license to use such technology 
such potential liabilities or increased costs could be materially adverse to the company 
the company s customers must comply with extensive regulations relating to confidentiality and  accordingly  the company s solutions must be able to assist its customers in complying with such regulations 
federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
regulations governing electronic health data privacy are continuing to evolve 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of protected health information 
hipaa requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of protected health information 
streamline health cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of streamline health s solutions are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of solutions and adversely affect the licensing of streamline health s solutions 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of streamline health software and services will occur 
third party products are essential to streamline health s software 
streamline health software incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate some of the company s proprietary software modules 
the loss of the ability to use these third party products  or ability to obtain substitute third party software at comparable prices  could have a material adverse affect on the ability to license streamline health software 
streamline health s solutions may not be error free and could result in claims of breach of contract and liabilities 
streamline health s solutions are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
although the company performs extensive testing  failure of any product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require streamline health to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not corrected within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possibly subjecting the company to liability 
also  streamline health sometimes indemnifies its customers against third party infringement claims 
if such claims are made  even if they are without merit  they could be expensive to defend 
streamline health s license agreement generally limits the company s liability arising from claims such as described in the foregoing sentences  but such limits may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or under some circumstances 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company could be liable to third parties from the use of the company s solutions 
the company s solutions provide access to patient information used by physicians and other medical personnel in providing medical care 
the medical care provided by physicians and other medical personnel are subject to numerous medical malpractice and other claims 
the company attempts to limit any potential liability of the company to customers by limiting the warranties on its solutions in the company s agreements with the company s customer  the healthcare provider 
however  such agreements do not protect the company from third party claims by patients who may seek damages from any or all persons or entities connected to the process of delivering patient care 
the company maintains insurance  which provides limited protection from such claims  if such claims against the company would result in liability to the company 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of our solutions  such claims may be made in the future 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company s remote application hosting services and support services could experience interruptions 
the company provides remote hosting services for many clients  including the storage of critical patient  financial and administrative data 
in addition  it provides support services to clients through the client support facility 
the company has redundancies  such as backup generators  redundant telecommunications lines  and backup facilities built into its operations to prevent disruptions 
however  complete failure of all generators or impairment of all telecommunications lines or severe casualty damage to the primary building or equipment inside the primary building housing our hosting center or client support facilities could cause a temporary disruption in operations and adversely affect clients who depend on the application hosting services 
any interruption in operations at its data center or client support facility could cause the company to lose existing clients  impede our ability to obtain new clients  result in revenue loss  cause potential liability to our clients  and increase our operating costs 
the company s remote application hosting services are provided over an internet connection 
any breach of security or confidentiality of protected health information could expose the company to significant expense  and harm to the company s reputation 
the company provides remote hosting services for clients  including the storage of critical patient  financial and administrative data 
the company has security measures in place to prevent or detect misappropriation of protected heath information 
the company must maintain facility and systems security measures to preserve the confidentiality of data belonging to clients as well as their patients that resides on computer equipment in the data center  which we handle via application hosting services  or that is otherwise in the company s possession 
notwithstanding efforts undertaken to protect data  it can be vulnerable to infiltration as well as unintentional lapse 
if confidential information is compromised  the company could face claims for contract breach  penalties and other liabilities for violation of applicable laws or regulations  significant costs for remediation and re engineering to prevent future occurrences  and serious harm to the company s reputation 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect streamline health s business 
streamline health s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management  sales force and technical personnel 
the company must recruit  motivate  and retain highly skilled managers  sales  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants  and system architects who have the requisite expertise in the technical environments in which our solutions operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
the company s failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may not have access to sufficient capital to be competitive in its markets 
streamline health may need additional capital in the form of loans or equity in order to operate and to be competitive 
the company may be limited to the availability of such capital or may not have any availability  in which case the company s future prospects may be materially impaired 
the company must maintain compliance with the terms of its existing credit facilities 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to finance its ongoing operations and the company may not be able to find an alternative lending source if a default would occur 
on october   the company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with its existing lender 
upon doing so  the company was able to negotiate modified terms in which the minimum tangible net worth requirement was eliminated 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain compliance with all of the continuing covenants and other terms and conditions of this credit facility on an ongoing basis 
if not  the company could be required to pay back the amounts borrowed on an accelerated basis  which could subject the company to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  if the company would need to find an alternative lending source  the company may have difficulty in doing so  particularly in the current credit environment which is not favorable to borrowers 
without a sufficient credit facility  the company would be adversely affected by a lack of access to liquidity needed to operate the company s business 
any disruption in access to credit could force the company to take measures to conserve cash  such as deferring important research and development expenses  which measures could have a material adverse effect on the company 
potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business  including the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if internal funds are not available from operations  the company may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet its financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
the company s access to funds under its revolving credit facility or pursuant to arrangements with other financial institutions is dependent on the ability of the financial institution s ability to meet funding commitments 
financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience high volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time 
current economic conditions in the united states and globally may have significant effects on the company s customers and suppliers that would result in material adverse effects on the company s business  operating results and stock price 
current economic conditions in the united states and globally and the concern that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period may materially adversely affect the company s customers access to capital or willingness to spend capital on the company s products and services and or their levels of cash liquidity in with which or willingness to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from the company 
continuing adverse economic conditions would also likely negatively impact the company s business  which could result in reduced demand for the company s products and services  increased price competition for the company s products and services  increased risk of collectability of cash from the company s customers  increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable  reduced revenues  and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 
all of the foregoing potential consequences of the current economic conditions are difficult to forecast and mitigate 
as a consequence  the company s operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict  and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of future results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect the company s stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile 
the public trading of the company s common stock is based on many factors  which could cause fluctuation in the price of the company s common stock 
these factors may include  but are not limited to general economic and market conditions  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  lack of research coverage by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the healthcare information technology industry  changes in the market valuations of other companies in the company s industry  announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives  capital commitments  additional or departures of key personnel  and sales and repurchases of the company s common stock 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
these factors may cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline  regardless of the company s operating performance 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements 
one of the company s most critical estimates is the capitalization of software development costs 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates  the company cannot provide absolute assurance that it will not significantly increase or decrease such estimates upon determination of the actual results 
any required adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations  and could result in the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements 
changes in accounting standards could impact the company s reported earnings and financial condition 
the accounting standard setters  including the financial accounting standards board  the us securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies  periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  which could result in the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements 
failure to improve and maintain the quality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide timely and accurate financial information about the company 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the company s fiscal year end  management conducted a review of the internal control structure over financial reporting 
no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses were identified 
however  management cannot be certain that deficiencies will not arise in the future or be identified or that the company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner 
foreign currency risk in connection with the company s expansion into foreign markets  the company is a receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in the exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
these risks are not exhaustive 
other sections of this form k may include additional factors which could adversely impact the company s business and financial performance 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the company s management to predict all risk factors  nor can the company assess the impact of all factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see also part  item  business for general and specific descriptions of streamline health s business 
executive overview company initiatives and strategy in  the company established a new division to take advantage of what we believe is a significant growth opportunity to provide customized document workflow solutions and business process management or bpm consulting services 
many industry consultants  including gartner research  believe healthcare organizations face an ever increasing demand to improve business processes and reduce costs  especially in the current economic climate 
business process management is a proven discipline which allows organizations to improve their business operations by identifying  automating and optimizing existing labor intensive business processes that cause bottlenecks and inefficiencies 
bpm solutions are quickly rising to the top of technology spending priorities across many healthcare organizations 
a cio study by himss analytics placed bpm solutions as the number two spending priority on corporate it budgets 
additionally  according to forrester research  by the global market for bpm solutions is expected to reach billion 
this is a significant increase from the under billion produced in the company has already created and installed numerous custom workflow based bpm solutions  referred to as streamline optimization solutions  or sos  at several existing customer locations  enabling them to streamline their patient financial services  human resources and administrative document centric processes 
streamline health s objective is to continue to be a leading provider of health information management  patient financial services  and administrative workflow solutions to the healthcare industry by providing process integration services and solutions 
highlight customer satisfaction the company has made significant investment in customer satisfaction initiatives during fiscal  which will continue into the company has identified the need to better service our legacy architecture as we transition our existing customer base to the fifth generation architecture  accessanyware focus on sales and marketing as a result of the first delivery and implementation of the company s th generation architecture  accessanyware  in it is anticipated that the company will shift its investments in resources from research and development into additional sales  marketing and implementation resources 
the company has developed a library of departmental process optimization solutions that it believes will provide the impetus for its future growth 
accordingly  the company will be investing in additional resources to promote  sell and implement its portfolio of departmental solutions 
building the recurring revenue stream streamline health experienced a significant growth in hosting services contracts and related backlog of recurring revenue over the past two fiscal years 
the company is experiencing a dramatic shift away from its traditional model of licensed  locally installed software  towards our hosted delivery model 
a desirable byproduct of this dramatic shift to the hosted model is much better visibility for future revenue streams based on backlog fulfillment from hosted contracts over typical five year contract periods  as well as a high percentage of contract renewals after the initial term 
factors that we believe have contributed to this significant shift to the hosted delivery model are hosted services are now becoming more main stream  and market adoption has increased dramatically over the past few years 
small to mid sized healthcare organizations do not have the capital  or the information technology staffs to support complex  locally installed software 
economic conditions  and reduced access to credit have forced hospital organizations to reconsider their capital purchases and look to operating lease alternatives  such as our hosted services  to meet their software needs 
hosted services are an excellent hedge against future obsolescence  and provide a lower risk alternative to traditional licensed models 
streamline health now provides hosted services to the health alliance of greater cincinnati  catholic healthcare west  t

clay medical center  marion general medical center  the university of california san francisco ucsf  massena medical center  columbus ohio vital statistics  and children s medical center of columbus  oh  new york presbyterian hospital  and children s national medical center  washington  dc  among others 
in addition  streamline health has licensed its workflow and document management solutions  which are installed at leading healthcare providers including parkview health  pro health care  peace health  texas health resources  sarasota memorial hospital  the albert einstein healthcare network  beth israel medical center  and memorial sloan kettering cancer center  among others 
we believe that the realignment will better focus and position the company to take advantage of increased market opportunities for hosted services  particularly at the lower end of the healthcare market where opportunities for these services is growing much faster than the marketplace in general 
we also believe that our hosted services provide us with a significant advantage in the marketplace  as many of our competitors do not have a comparable offering 
expand distribution channels streamline health estimates the total market for streamline health s document management solutions and services could be in excess of billion  and the market is less than penetrated 
streamline health strongly believes its highly evolved  secure and technologically advanced web browser based hosted applications will position streamline health to take advantage of  what it continues to believe will be  significantly increasing market opportunities for streamline health and its distribution partners in the future 
execute on product development goals streamline health intends to continue its product development efforts and increase the functionality of existing applications along with the development of new applications using workflow technologies 
in particular  streamline health intends to increase the functionality of its web based applications 
streamline health has continued to add new features  functionality and workflow applications to its suite of products  including revenue cycle management solutions such as remote coding  remote physician order processing  pre admission registration scanning  insurance verification  explanation of benefits processing  and enterprise compliance solutions 
streamline health believes only the most robust  flexible  dependable solutions will survive in the healthcare market  and streamline health has attempted to establish itself as a leader in document management and workflow based solutions through strong product development 
continued research and development streamline health continues to focus its research and development efforts to develop new application software and increase the functionality of existing applications 
customer requirements and desires significantly influence streamline health s research and development efforts 
results of operations fiscal revenue performance was in line with expectations 
the company recognized revenues of approximately million  a record for the company 
the revenues recognized relating to the general availability of accessanyware  and continued revenue recognition of hosted contracts  were coupled with targeted expense reductions and phased in strategic investments  which were primary contributors to the company exceeding its expectations of operating profits in fiscal the company achieved an operating profit of approximately million in fiscal  compared to operating losses of million in fiscal the following table sets forth  for each fiscal year indicated  certain operating data as percentages statement of operations fiscal year systems sales services  maintenance and support application hosting services total revenues cost of sales selling  general and administrative product research and development total operating expenses operating profit loss other income expense  net income tax net benefit net earnings loss cost of systems sales cost of services  maintenance and support cost of application hosting services because a significant percentage of the operating costs are incurred at levels that are not necessarily correlated with revenue levels  a variation in the timing of systems sales and installations and the resulting revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results 
as a result  period to period comparisons may not be meaningful with respect to the past operations nor are they necessarily indicative of the future operations of streamline health in the near or long term 
the data in the table is presented solely for the purpose of reflecting the relationship of various operating elements to revenues for the periods indicated 
all references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year commencing on february of that calendar year and ending on january of the following year 
comparison of fiscal year with the approximate net increase in working capital deficit of  at january  from january  resulted primarily from the following the decrease in cash resulted primarily from significant increases in accounts receivable net of cash collected  property and equipment additions  and capitalized software expenditures 
in addition  the timing of vendor payments and deferred revenues negatively impacted the balance of cash at the end of the fiscal year 
the net increase of  in accounts and contract receivables  both current and non current  is primarily due to the general release of accessanyware and the associated billed receivables of approximately  this was coupled with a net  increase in billed receivables in the fourth quarter 
the approximate  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses at january  from january  is due to compensation accruals  including quarterly commissions and discretionary bonuses  coupled with the timing of vendor payments at the end of the fiscal year 
the approximate million decrease in deferred revenues results primarily from revenues recognized in the amount of  on one large hosted contract due to acceptance criteria being met   relating to the delivery of accessanyware to a canadian customer  and approximately  relating to earned maintenance revenues 
revenues revenues consisted of the following in thousands for the years ended january  dollars percent change change proprietary software hardware third party software professional services maintenance support application hosting services total revenues proprietary software and hardware are the components of the system sales line item professional services and maintenance support are the components of the service  maintenance and support line item 
this includes bpm consulting services 
total revenues for fiscal year were  compared with revenues of  in fiscal year  an increase of approximately  or 
the increase is attributable to the software and other services revenue recognized which are associated with the delivery of accessanyware to a canadian customer  and coupled with increases in application hosting revenues and professional services 
in addition  the company s increased application hosting is primarily due to several newer hosted customer projects reaching acceptance criteria by the third quarter of fiscal revenues from new hosted customer agreements entered into since july of fiscal continue to incrementally roll out in fiscal proprietary software revenues from software sales in fiscal year were  an increase of  or from fiscal this increase was the result of approximately million in software revenues recognized  net of foreign currency adjustments  relative to the general availability and delivery of accessanyware to a canadian customer 
this was offset by decreased spending on new proprietary software by our existing customers 
hardware and third party software revenues from hardware and third party software sales in fiscal were  a decrease of  or from fiscal the decrease in hardware and third party software revenue in fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in upgrades from the existing customer base in fiscal  as compared to fiscal maintenance and support revenues from maintenance  and support in fiscal year were  an increase of  or from fiscal the increase in maintenance and support results from the addition of new customers  expansion of existing systems by customers  and scheduled annual increases for renewals 
professional services revenues from professional services in fiscal year were  an increase of  or from fiscal in fiscal  the company entered into several application hosting services contracts for which the customer acceptance provisions within that contract caused professional services revenue to be deferred until all customer acceptance provisions were met 
the professional services revenues recognized due to customer milestones being met contributed to the large increase  along with a continued high demand for professional services from our customer base 
application hosting revenues from application hosting services were  or an increase of  or from fiscal this increase is attributable to an increase in the number of hosting customers 
revenues from new hosted customer agreements entered into since july of fiscal continue to roll out in fiscal  fueling increases in the recurring hosted revenue stream 
revenues from remarketing partners total revenues from ge were  or in fiscal year as compared to  or in fiscal revenues in fiscal were primarily derived of  for hardware and third party software sales   for streamline health software   for professional services   for maintenance and support revenues  and  of hosting revenues 
streamline health relies on ge healthcare for a significant amount of its revenues  the loss of which would have a material adverse affect on future results of operations 
total revenues from telus health were  in fiscal year  or of total revenues 
revenues were primarily derived of  for streamline health software  and  for professional services 
remaining recognized revenues were from hardware third party software  and system maintenance 
in fiscal year  three customers accounted for of the total revenues  compared to in fiscal year  exclusive of our remarketing partners 
a substantial portion of fiscal year total revenues came from fulfillment of backlog and add on business  primarily expansion and upgrades and a large new customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of sales cost of sales consisted of the following in thousands for the years ended january  dollars percent change change cost of system sales cost of services  maintenance and support cost of application hosting total cost of sales cost of sales consists of cost of systems sales  cost of services  maintenance and support  and cost of application hosting services 
cost of systems sales includes amortization of capitalized software expenditures  royalties  and the cost of third party hardware and software 
cost of systems sales  as a percentage of systems sales  varies from period to period depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems sold 
the cost of systems sales as a percentage of associated revenues in fiscal year and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of sales is primarily the result of the reduced hardware and third party software sales and the associated direct costs 
cost of systems sales as a percentage of systems sales may vary from period to period depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems sold or add on sales delivered 
the relatively fixed cost of the capitalized software amortization compared to the variable nature of system sales each quarter causes these percentages to vary dramatically  especially in those periods where systems sales are low 
cost of services  maintenance and support as a percentage of services  maintenance and support revenues in and were and  respectively 
the cost of services  maintenance and support includes compensation and benefits for support and professional services personnel and the cost of third party maintenance contracts 
these increases are due to primarily the increased professional services staffing costs and third party maintenance contract costs associated with supporting an increased customer base  and specifically the startup costs of the bpm services 
the cost of application hosting services in and as a percentage of revenues was and  respectively 
the cost of application hosting services operations is relatively fixed  but subject to inflation for the goods and services it requires 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased depreciation and third party license and maintenance expenses as a result of the growing hosting center operations 
selling  general and administrative expense for the years ended january  dollars percent change change in thousands selling  general  and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits and reimbursable travel and living expenses related to the company s sales  marketing and administrative personnel  advertising and marketing expenses  including trade shows and similar type sales and marketing expenses  and general corporate expenses  including occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal and as a percentage of revenues were and  respectively 
this decrease over the respective comparable prior periods is due to effective cost management measures begun in the third quarter of fiscal including  planned reductions in sales and administrative expenses  and strategic hiring and employee compensation structures since the reduction in sales force during fiscal the company has been able to capitalize on the efficiencies gained by improving the allocation of resources  and reducing expenses 
product research and development expense for the years ended january  dollars percent change change in thousands research and development product research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits  the use of independent contractors for specific near term development projects  and an allocated portion of general overhead costs  including occupancy 
research and development expenses in fiscal and  as a percentage of revenues  were and  respectively 
while software capitalization remained relatively constant  the decrease in the percentage of research and development expense to revenue was attributable to cost cutting measures  which decreased research and development expenses not eligible for capitalization in the fourth quarter of fiscal operating profit loss the company achieved an operating profit of  in fiscal  compared to a operating loss of  in fiscal significant revenues recognized relating to the general availability of accessanyware and the continued revenue recognition of hosted contracts  which were coupled with targeted expense reductions and efficiency initiatives  contributed to improved operating profits 
other income expense interest income in fiscal was compared  in fiscal interest income consists primarily of interest on cash balances 
the interest income declined during because of lower cash balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense in was related to the working capital facility interest and fees  along with accrued interest for the capital lease 
interest expense from the working capital facility was  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase in the interest expense in results primarily from a larger average balance outstanding than in fiscal provision for income taxes the tax provision in fiscal is comprised of federal alternative minimum tax  and state taxes 
the tax provision in is primarily state provisions 
net earnings loss the company achieved net earnings of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal significant revenues recognized relating to accessanyware and hosted contracts  and strategic spending allowed for significantly improved earnings in fiscal backlog at january  streamline health has master agreements and purchase orders from customers and remarketing partners for systems and related services excluding support and maintenance  and transaction based application hosting revenues  which have not been delivered or installed which  if fully performed  would generate future revenues of approximately  compared with  at january  the related systems and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to three years 
the decrease in the backlog is the result of fewer contracts entered into during fiscal and further recognition of the professional services related to fiscal contracts 
the  streamline health software component of this backlog declined from the prior year of  due to the recognition of the revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  for the delivery of accessanyware to a canadian customer 
at january   streamline health had maintenance agreements purchase orders  from customers and remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  compared with  at january   through their respective renewal dates in fiscal year and the decrease results primarily from the recognition in fiscal of maintenance revenue from one long term maintenance contract for one large customer 
at january   streamline health has entered into hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years through the application hosting backlog decreased from the  at january   due to the decreased volume of new hosting business and renewals  and recognized revenues from contracts signed in fiscal below is a summary of the backlog at january  and january  january  streamline health software licenses custom software hardware and third party software professional services application hosting services recurring maintenance total streamline health believes a greater percentage of its future revenues will come from remarketing agreements with  ge healthcare  and other his related vendors such as the telus health agreement that was entered into in december streamline health continues to actively pursue remarketing agreements with other companies 
the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of the application hosting services 
therefore  it is difficult for the company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
streamline health s master agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by streamline health  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
outlook for as current customers and new prospects review their needs for enhancement of their current enterprise wide systems  the company expects to see an increased demand for departmental workflow solutions  and custom workflow consulting offerings 
the company expects to also see growth in our remarketing relationships 
declines in purchased software can have an adverse affect on our short term earnings 
however  increases in hosted agreements create a baseline of recurring revenues that lessen large changes in earnings from year to year 
the company also intends to continue with targeted spending and cost efficiency measures implemented in fiscal and  into fiscal the company expects the capitalization of software development costs to decrease in  due to the completion of the first major release of accessanyware in january likewise  the company is expected to incur amortization expenses in excess of million in fiscal relating to the capitalized software development costs for accessanyware beginning to amortize due to its general availability in january application of critical accounting policies streamline health s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires streamline health to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  streamline health evaluates its estimates  including those related to product revenues  bad debts  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  warranty obligations  support contracts  contingencies and litigation 
streamline health bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that streamline health believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and revenue recognition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
streamline health believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the licensing and sale of systems  either directly to end users or through third party resellers  comprising of internally developed software  third party software and hardware components  product support  maintenance and professional services 
the company also sells the software application through hosting services which also provide high quality  transaction or subscription based document imaging management services from a central data center 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition and asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the company commences revenue recognition when the following criteria all have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable if the company determines that any of the above criteria has not been met  the company will defer recognition of the revenue until all the criteria have been met 
multiple element arrangements in arrangements that include multiple elements eg  proprietary software  other third party hardware and software components  post contract customer support pcs installation services  and or training  the company allocates the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement to the elements based on their relative fair value of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  which is based on the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the amounts representing the fair value of vsoe of the undelivered items such as pcs are deferred until delivered  or recognized pro rata over the service contract  which is typically one year 
software license arrangements the company utilizes the residual method to recognize software license fees provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
under the residual method  the difference between the fair value of vsoe of the undelivered elements and the total arrangement fee is recognized as the license fee upon delivery 
the revenue related to the undelivered elements are deferred until delivered and or recognized pro rata over the term that the related service contract 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenues are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
each contract is reviewed quarterly by management to determine the appropriateness of the revenue recognition criteria applied to the individual contracts based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed streamline health for licensed software  professional services  including maintenance services and application hosting services 
contracts with individual customers and resellers determine when receivables are due and payable 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  each unpaid receivable greater than ninety days old is reviewed monthly to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment thereof 
in addition  the financial status of current customers is reviewed monthly to determine the customer s ability to pay their outstanding balance 
corrective action  if necessary  is taken by the company to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables 
during these monthly reviews  streamline health determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its customers or resellers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or resellers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company s customers typically have been well established hospitals  medical facilities  or major healthcare information systems companies that resell streamline health products  which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare facilities have experienced significant operating losses and limited cash resources as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
extended payment of receivables is not uncommon from such healthcare facilities 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with asc software costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development  including coding and testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility are classified as product research and development and are expensed as incurred 
once technological feasibility has been determined  a portion of the costs incurred in development  including coding  testing  and product quality assurance  are capitalized until available for general release to customers  and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
amortization is calculated on a product by product basis and is over the estimated economic life of the software  typically three years  using the straight line method 
amortization commences immediately following when a product is available for general release to customers 
unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at the date of such determination 
streamline health reviews  on an on going basis  the carrying value of its capitalized software development expenditures  net of accumulated amortization 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expensed approximately  for partial impairment on a specific workflow product that had been under development for the past few years 
the capitalized costs relating to this product were written down to its expected net realizable value based upon the current future sales estimates at january  there was no impairment recognized in fiscal streamline health believes that to replicate its existing software would cost significantly more than the stated net book value of  at january  over the last three years  streamline health has spent approximately  in research and development  of which  or  has been capitalized 
amortization of capitalized software expenditures during the last three years has amounted to approximately  or a net increase in capitalized software of approximately  during the last three years 
many of the programs related to capitalized software development continue to have significant value to streamline health s current solutions and those under development  as the concepts  ideas  and software code are readily transferable and are incorporated into new products 
equity awards stock based compensation the company records equity award expenses in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires the expensing of the fair value of the equity award on a straight line basis  over the vesting period 
future grants of equity awards could have a material impact on reported expenses depending upon the number  value and vesting period of future awards 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grants using a black scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions of the risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility factor of the expected market price of streamline health s common stock  the expected life of stock options and a forfeiture rate 
we currently estimate volatility by using the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using a historical forfeiture rate 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of asc  income taxes 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the appropriate amount of expense to record for income taxes 
these assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates as well as current tax regulations 
accruals are established for estimates of tax effects for certain transactions  credits  and future projected profitability of our businesses based on our interpretation of existing facts and circumstances 
if these assumptions and estimates were to change as a result of new evidence or changes in circumstances  the change in estimate could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the changes to the company s reserve for uncertain tax positions yielded a  adjustment to increase the beginning balance of retained earnings on the company s fiscal balance sheet 
the company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position during the next twelve months 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain tax positions have been recorded as of january  a key assumption in the determination of the recognized tax benefit or provision is the amount of the valuation allowance required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to a level which will  more likely than not  be realized 
whether the deferred tax assets will be realized depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax asset become deductible 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
fair value measurements the company determines fair value measurements using the fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
liquidity and capital resources traditionally  streamline health has funded its operations  working capital needs  and capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash generated by operations  bank loans  and revolving lines of credit 
streamline health s liquidity is dependent upon numerous factors including i the timing and amount of revenues and collection of contractual amounts from customers  ii amounts invested in research and development  capital expenditures  and iii the level of operating expenses  all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
streamline health s customers typically have been well established hospitals or medical facilities or major his companies that resell streamline health products  which have good credit histories and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare organizations have experienced significant operating losses as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
agreements with customers often involve significant amounts and contract terms typically require customers to make progress payments 
current economic events  as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets  have adversely affected the availability of financing for some of our customers 
these recent events  to date  have not materially impacted the quality of our accounts receivable balances or our ability to access our working capital facility 
streamline health has no significant obligations for capital resources  other than the  borrowed under its bank line of credit at january   and the non cancelable operating leases of approximately  payable over the next four years  and  for capital leases 
capital expenditures for property and equipment in are not expected to exceed  streamline health capitalized approximately  and  in and  respectively 
research and development expense  net of capitalized software development expenditures  was  and  in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  from approximately  in the prior fiscal year 
the relative decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in cash provided from accounts  contracts and installment receivables of  decreased cash from deferred revenues of  decrease in cash used from accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and offset by decrease in cash used in other prepaid assets of  see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the individual components comprising the net cash provided by operating activities 
during the last two years  streamline health has provided significant net cash outlays for capital expenditures  sales and marketing investments  product research and development investments  support and consulting investments  and made net debt repayments of approximately  accordingly  to position the company to achieve consistent and increasing revenues and profitability  the company has begun to shift away from traditional software license sales towards a focus on application hosting sales 
this shift creates a cash flow deficiency in the early years of the hosted contract life as cash payments for the service are received over the life of the hosted contract 
to combat this  the company has selectively and prudently reallocated expenses away from development efforts and invested in sales and marketing resources and talent that is expected to produce improved results in fiscal the company has also made a significant reinvestment in customer support efforts for the transition to accessanyware  and enhancements in the support of the existing accessanyware customers 
the company views these reallocations of resources as essential to the future short term and long term success of the company  however there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve their stated goals 
at january   streamline health had cash on hand of  streamline health believes that its present cash position  combined with cash generation currently anticipated from operations  the availability of the revolving credit facility  and possible access to new funding sources will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months
