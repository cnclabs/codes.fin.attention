item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell photovoltaic pv products  known as pv or solar laminates that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
our solar laminates have unique characteristics that differentiate them from conventional crystalline solar modules  including physical flexibility  light weight  high durability and ease of installation 
these characteristics make our products particularly suitable for rooftop and building integrated photovoltaic bipv applications  which are our primary target markets 
we manufacture our solar laminates using a proprietary process and technology that we developed through nearly years of research 
we are also expanding our portfolio of solutions in the low load bearing building applied bapv market 
in addition  we develop and install solar pv systems on rooftops and in other applications to which our pv products are well suited 
solar sales represent over of our revenues 
we also receive fees and royalties from licensees of our nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology and sell high performance nickel hydroxide used in nimh batteries 
our business segments we operate our business in two segments united solar ovonic and ovonic materials 
financial information regarding each segment is available in note  business segments  to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
united solar ovonic our united solar ovonic segment designs  manufactures and sells pv laminates that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
this business  which we conduct through our wholly owned subsidiary  united solar ovonic llc uso  is based principally on our pioneering technologies for thin film amorphous silicon pv laminates and roll to roll manufacturing 
on august   we acquired of the outstanding common shares of solar integrated technologies  inc sit  which expanded our sales activities to include design  development and installation of rooftop bipv systems and applications  as well as enhanced our field engineering and technical support activities 
through a combination of sit and uso resources  we also develop specialized ground mount and rooftop pv projects  including projects that deploy our pv laminates 
our pv laminates possess several unique attributes that make them ideal for both rooftop and building integrated applications  including the ability to be integrated with roofing materials  qualify for special bipv incentives  light weight  superior resistance to wind uplift  no roof penetration  high durability and impact resistance  and ease of installation 
in addition  our products generate more 
table of contents electricity in real world conditions than many competing products  resulting in higher financial returns for our customers 
we sell our pv laminates principally for commercial and industrial rooftop applications 
we believe we have a strategic competitive advantage because our pv laminates are readily adaptable for integration into various roofing materials 
we sell our laminates to commercial roofing materials manufacturers  builders and building contractors  and solar power installers integrators who incorporate our pv laminates into their products for commercial sale and then handle all aspects of the consumer relationship  including marketing  sales and service 
we have developed similar relationships with residential roofing material manufacturers  who are developing applications to sell our laminates through their distribution and installation channels for the residential market 
we are also expanding our portfolio of solutions in the low load bearing bapv market through the introduction of new products such as powertilt  which offers a lightweight building applied solution combined with slight tilt that provides greater energy output 
in addition  we are developing multiple building integrated products to address the residential rooftop market opportunities in north america and europe 
for example  we have worked with market leader certainteed to develop and launch its energen brand residential solar system that integrates our flexible pv laminates with traditional asphalt residential roofing shingles 
the adaptability of our lightweight  flexible pv laminates also presents opportunities for sales to developers of certain ground mount and other pv applications 
in addition  through sit we now have the capability to sell complete rooftop pv systems directly to end user customers 
we manufacture our pv laminates using our proprietary vacuum deposition and large scale  roll to roll manufacturing processes that deposit amorphous silicon as a thin film on a stainless steel substrate 
we have designed  developed and manufactured the automated production equipment based on these proprietary process technologies 
we believe our manufacturing process and product design create significant barriers to entry for competitors who may seek to produce products similar to our own 
we also believe that consolidating our pv equipment design and manufacturing activities with our pv laminate manufacturing activities allows us to more effectively improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce capital costs 
our pv sales compete with companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on well established technologies for electricity generation  as well as companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on alternative energy generation technologies  such as solar and wind 
our principal competitors in the solar market include sharp corporation  q cells ag  evergreen solar  inc  kyocera corporation  sanyo electric co  ltd 
sanyo  sunpower corp  mitsubishi electric corporation  yingli solar  trina solar limited  and suntech power holdings co  ltd  all of which manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon pv modules  and first solar  inc  which manufactures thin film  cadmium telluride pv modules on glass substrates 
the competitiveness of alternative energy generation products in general  including solar power products  is typically enhanced by governmental incentives designed to encourage the use of these products as compared to conventional energy generation sources  which today are less expensive at the customer level in most locations 
however  our long term goal is to compete directly  without subsidies  in energy markets 
sit competes with numerous developers  contractors and installers of pv systems principally for rooftop applications 
we have entered into long term supply agreements with our customers  some of which are take or pay agreements under which we could demand that the customer purchase a specified minimum amount of our products 
as of june   our backlog of anticipated product sales for fiscal years through was million 
as of june   our backlog of anticipated product sales was approximately billion including sales to sit  which we subsequently acquired in august of  of million 
anticipated product sales include future firm commitments under take or pay 
table of contents agreements ie contractually required minimum quantities  confirmed orders from customers as of june  and government contracts 
the company s estimate of anticipated product sales may be impacted by various assumptions  including anticipated price reductions  currency exchange rates  and overall customer demand 
current macroeconomic conditions  including the global economic crisis  are adversely impacting our customers  including some customers who are unable to fully comply with take or pay agreements  and  as a result  our revenues and net income are likewise adversely impacted 
we are working with our customers to preserve relationships and maximize long term value by  among other things  reallocating product shipments to other customers and pursuing other remedies including contract renegotiations  as appropriate on a case by case basis 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our backlog and customer demand more generally  see item a risk factors 
our strategic customers include solardis soprasolar  alwitra flachdach systeme gmbh  advanced green technologies  inc a unit of advanced roofing  inc  marcegaglia taranto spa  derbigum suisse sarl  and centrosolar ag 
the only customer with sales in excess of of our solar sales was enel green power  which represented of our solar sales in this segment for the fiscal year 
for more information about our major customers and our revenues by geographic region  see note business segments  to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we presently have megawatts mw of nameplate manufacturing capacity 
our long term research and development strategy involves reducing production costs  improving light to electricity conversion efficiency and identifying new commercial applications for our products 
we seek to offset our research and development costs with third party funding  including product development agreements and government funding 
we entered into a cooperative agreement in which we will receive approximately million from the department of energy under an innovative program  the solar america initiative  to increase the efficiency of our photovoltaic products  lower material costs and develop innovative installation methods in order to reduce overall system costs 
this program will end in february recently  we announced our technology roadmap to improve conversion efficiency and reduce cost per watt by introducing new processes in our production machines 
in the first phase  we modified  and are now optimizing  a deposition line at our auburn hills campus to incorporate our new high frequency hf deposition technology 
we expect that laminates with aperture area conversion efficiency  as compared to our current conversion efficiency of  will be produced from this facility in calendar year  at a reduced cost per watt 
the next phase will involve modifications of another deposition line at our auburn hills campus to hf  and also modifications to the deposition lines at our greenville campus to incorporate our hf technology depositing enhanced efficiency silicon hybrid nano  which is expected to further increase aperture area efficiency to in calendar year  with further reductions cost per watt 
these modifications will increase the capacity of the modified lines 
the key raw materials used in our united solar ovonic segment business are stainless steel  high purity industrial gases primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane and polymer materials 
we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of key raw materials and components for our pv laminate manufacturing needs 
we have recently expanded our supplier base for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost reduction and quality  while limiting the number of suppliers who act as the single source supplier for a particular raw material 
we are actively managing our direct material costs through purchasing strategies  product design and operating improvements 
we have entered into long term supply agreements  some of which are take or pay agreements that require us to purchase a specified minimum amount of materials with our suppliers 
our united solar ovonic segment is headquartered in auburn hills  michigan  and has manufacturing facilities in auburn hills and greenville  michigan and tijuana  mexico 
we maintain sales offices in france  germany  italy  spain  and the united states 
additionally  we have established a joint venture  united solar ovonic jinneng limited  which is organized under the laws of the people s republic of china  to manufacture solar products in china for sale in the chinese market using solar cells 
table of contents purchased from  and technology licensed by  uso 
we presently own of the joint venture  with the option to increase our ownership to in certain circumstances 
tianjin jinneng investment co 
owns the remainder of the joint venture 
the joint venture commenced operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ovonic materials our ovonic materials segment invents  designs and develops materials and products based on our pioneering materials science technology 
we seek to commercialize this technology internally and through third party relationships  such as licenses and joint ventures 
we are presently commercializing our materials  and consumer and stationary nimh battery technology through this segment 
we are also engaged in pre commercialization activities for our emerging technologies  the funding of which we seek to offset with royalties and licensing revenues and third party funding  including product development agreements and government funding 
nimh batteries nimh batteries are rechargeable energy storage solutions offering high power and energy  long cycle life and maintenance free operation 
they are adaptable to a broad range of consumer  transportation and stationary applications 
products utilizing our nimh battery technology compete with lead acid  nickel cadmium  lithium battery technologies and primary alkaline disposable batteries 
nimh batteries produce high energy and power for their weight and volume  do not contain any environmentally hazardous substances  have excellent durability and abuse tolerance  have a long cycle life  and provide excellent cost benefits 
we commercialize our nimh battery technology principally through third party licensing arrangements with nimh battery manufacturers throughout the world 
we also sell proprietary high performance positive electrode nickel hydroxide materials for use in nimh batteries 
we conduct our nimh battery technology licensing and materials manufacturing activities through our consolidated subsidiary ovonic battery company  inc  in which we have a equity interest and the balance is owned by honda motor company  ltd 
and sanoh industrial co  ltd 

on july   we completed the sale of our interest in cobasys llc  our former joint venture through which we also commercialized our nimh battery technology 
transportation nimh batteries are in widespread commercial use in hybrid electric vehicles where the nimh chemistry offers proven cost  safety  performance and durability 
the electrification of vehicles worldwide in hybrid electric vehicles hev  plug in hev phev and pure battery electric bev s is expected to be a high growth opportunity for rechargeable batteries  although there is significant competition in these transportation segments from emerging technologies such as lithium ion li ion 
licensing we have licensed our nimh battery technology to nimh battery manufacturers  principally for consumer and transportation applications  on a royalty bearing  non exclusive basis 
we are presently receiving royalties from manufacturers who are currently producing nimh batteries using our technology 
royalties from sanyo for consumer and transportation applications represented of our revenues in this segment for both fiscal years and 
table of contents as part of the sale of cobasys to sb limotive  we reacquired exclusive rights for stationary nimh batteries  subject to preexisting licenses 
stationary nimh batteries are well suited to compete in telecommunications  uninterruptible power supplies  and emerging energy storage applications 
nimh technology will compete in these storage applications due to its superior energy density  deep discharge cycle life and abuse tolerance compared to the incumbent large format lead acid battery technology 
whereas the higher energy per weight of li ion batteries compared to nimh batteries has allowed li ion chemistries to penetrate into portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cellular telephones and is the source of automotive interest  nimh chemistries are competitive on an energy per volume basis and therefore are a good match for stationary storage applications 
in addition  nimh batteries provide proven durability  abuse tolerance  an attractive cost value proposition and therefore a significant commercial opportunity 
various business models for monetizing our stationary nimh patents and know how are being considered  including licensing and cooperative ventures with our existing licensees and strategic partners in the value chain 
materials manufacturing we produce proprietary high performance positive electrode nickel hydroxide materials for use in nimh batteries  which we sell to licensees of our nimh battery technology 
our positive electrode materials offer advantages such as higher capacity and power  greater cycle life  high temperature performance and lower costs 
sales to gold peak industries holdings limited represented and  respectively  of our nimh materials product sales in this segment and and  respectively  of our total revenues in this segment for fiscal years and we conduct our manufacturing operations at an automated facility in troy  michigan 
the key raw materials used in our nickel hydroxide business are primarily nickel and cobalt 
all of the raw materials used are generally readily available from numerous sources  but interruptions in production or delivery of key raw materials could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations in this segment 
prices for these raw materials fluctuate in the normal course of business due to supply and demand 
our product pricing formula to our customers is based on the raw material price 
emerging technologies our research and development activities have generated new technologies  which we are seeking to bring to full scale commercialization 
these technologies  some of which are discussed below  are subject to further development and will require substantial additional funding to reach commercial product status 
we seek to offset our funding requirements by obtaining third party funding through strategic alliances and government contracts 
ovonic solid hydrogen storage technologies hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel source that yields more energy per unit of weight than any other combustible fuel  and we are developing a practical approach to storing hydrogen in a solid metal matrix at low pressures using a family of efficient metal hydrides 
our solid hydrogen storage solutions have several advantages over conventional gaseous and liquid storage solutions  including improved volumetric density and greater safety due to our technology s low pressure refilling and storage capabilities 
we are presently manufacturing and selling pre production volumes of portable hydrogen canisters in our rochester hills  michigan facility 

table of contents ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technologies fuel cells are environmentally clean power generators in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to produce electricity  with water and heat as the only byproducts 
our ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technology is a proprietary approach which provides a lower cost solution in comparison to conventional proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells  which require expensive platinum catalysts 
as part of our development activities  we have demonstrated high power fuel stacks utilizing our metal hydride fuel cell technology that meet the power ratings of certain commercially available fuel cells for the stationary market at a fraction of the cost 
ovonic bio reformation technologies hydrogen is a widely used industrial gas 
our ovonic reformation technology produces high purity hydrogen in a safe process from multiple renewable biofuel and biomass sources at far lower operating temperatures than commercial processes and without the generation of carbon dioxide gas 
our proprietary process has the potential to dramatically reduce distributed hydrogen cost by eliminating high transportation costs 
we are presently seeking funding as we move from laboratory scale development to pilot scale production 
ovonyx our ovonyx joint venture is commercializing our proprietary ovonic universal memory oum and ovonic threshold switch ots technology through licensing and product development arrangements 
oum is a basic  new type of nonvolatile memory that can replace conventional nonvolatile or flash memory in applications requiring retention of stored data when power is turned off  including cell phones  pdas  digital cameras and microelectronics 
oum  which is also known in the semiconductor industry as phase change random access memory pram and pc ram  offers several advantages over conventional nonvolatile memory  including significantly faster write time  greater scalability  lower power utilization and longer life  and is compatible with existing complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos manufacturing processes 
we own or on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to the potential exercise of stock options and warrants of the common stock of ovonyx 
as part of this joint venture arrangement  we have contributed intellectual property  licenses  production processes and know how 
in addition to our equity interest in ovonyx  we receive of the ovonyx annual gross revenue as a royalty 
ovonyx has entered into royalty bearing  nonexclusive license agreements with intel corporation  samsung electronics co  ltd  elpida memory  inc  stmicroelectronics nv  bae systems  hynix semiconductor  inc  and numonyx bv acquired by micron technology  inc  to produce oum products 
under most of these agreements  ovonyx has participated in joint development programs to assist in the commercialization of oum phase change memory products 
our technology and intellectual property the principal markets in which we compete the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets are characterized by rapid change and competition driven by technological and product performance advantages  as well as cost 
we have driven some of this activity through our pioneering and proprietary materials  product and production process technologies 
at the same time  we are actively engaged in product design and development to commercialize and improve our materials  products and production processes 

table of contents research and development expenditures our research and development expenditures are reflected as cost of revenues from product development agreements and product development and research expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we seek to offset our research and development costs with third party funding  including joint ventures  product development agreements and government funding 
patents and intellectual property we maintain an extensive patent portfolio presently consisting of approximately us patents and over foreign counterparts to which we are regularly adding new patents based upon our continuing research and development activities 
importantly  our portfolio includes numerous basic and fundamental patents applicable to each of our segments  covering not only materials  but also the production technology and products we develop 
based on the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio  we believe that our proprietary patent position is sustainable notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents 
we do not expect the expiration of any patents to materially affect the business prospects of any of our segments 
competition since our businesses are based upon our pioneering technologies that offer fundamental solutions in the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets  we compete not only at the product level for market share but also at the technology level for market acceptance 
our competition includes well established conventional technologies  other alternative technology solutions and other technologies within an alternative solution 
for example  our pv technology competes with conventional electricity generation technologies  such as gas and coal  alternative electricity generation technologies  such as wind and nuclear  and other solar technologies  such as crystalline products 
our business competitors include some of the world s largest industrial companies  many of which are pursuing new technology solutions in addition to their well established conventional technologies 
a key factor affecting demand for pv systems is the levelized cost of energy lcoe supplied by such systems in comparison to other sources of electricity 
lcoe is determined by dividing the present value of the total lifetime cost of a pv system by the present value of the total energy output of the system measured in kilowatt hours 
major factors affecting the lcoe of pv systems include cost of the pv products  energy conversion efficiency of the pv products  cost of the remaining components of the pv system balance of system costs  maintenance costs  and durability of performance 
developers and purchasers of pv systems  particularly utility scale and large commercial grid connected systems  generally seek to obtain the lowest lcoe by choosing pv systems that optimize this combination of low pv product cost  high conversion efficiency  low balance of system and maintenance costs  and long time durability 
as a result of technology innovation  manufacturing scale and efficiency improvements and dramatic reductions in the cost of polycrystalline silicon and certain other raw materials used in many pv products  the lcoe of pv systems generally has been declining rapidly in recent years 
we believe that we have derived a key business and technological advantage through our research and development activities by continuously inventing new technologies and improving our existing materials  products and production processes 
however  even as we successfully pursue these research and development activities  some of our technologies  particularly in the alternative energy generation and energy storage markets  presently face commercial barriers as compared to well established conventional technologies  including infrastructural barriers  customer transition costs and higher manufacturing costs associated with present production volumes 
the competitiveness of products based on our technologies 
table of contents in these areas is typically enhanced by external factors  including rising energy costs  concerns regarding energy security and governmental incentives at the consumer level 
our long term goal is to compete directly in energy markets without subsidies

item a risk factors our success depends significantly on our ability through technology improvements to reduce the cost and improve the conversion efficiency of our solar laminates and otherwise to continue to develop and market new and innovative products 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or the capital spending required will be available 
our financial performance depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing solar laminates  develop new and innovative products and product applications  reduce our costs of producing solar laminates  and adopt or develop new technologies that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
the continued demand for our solar products is premised in part on the features of our solar laminates that distinguish them from the solar products of our competitors and the resulting unique product applications 
these features include physical flexibility  the ability of our laminates to be integrated with roofing materials  light weight  superior resistance to wind uplift  durability  no roof penetration and ease of installation 
there are companies using similar or competitive technologies that have introduced or announced plans to introduce solar products incorporating some or all of these features 
in addition  all solar products compete based on efficiency and significant advances in the efficiency of the solar products of our competitors also could provide them with a competitive advantage 
if we fail to enhance our existing solar laminates  develop new and innovative products and product applications  or adopt or develop new technologies that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in june we announced our technology roadmap to improve both the conversion efficiency and cost per watt of our laminates and thereby reduce the lcoe of pv systems that incorporate our laminates to enhance our ability to compete more effectively with other pv suppliers 
we also announced specific objectives regarding conversion efficiency  laminate cost per watt  and lcoe 
our technology roadmap requires a substantial investment of financial resources and novel alterations of our manufacturing processes and product designs 
it also requires careful project management and coordination of multiple simultaneous activities 
there is no assurance that we will have access to sufficient capital to fund our 
table of contents technology roadmap or otherwise be able to execute fully or timely on our technology roadmap in order to achieve the cost reduction and conversion efficiency goals that we have established 
if we are unable to achieve these goals our ability to compete effectively with other pv suppliers  and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the continuing global economic  capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks for our business segments 
the continuing global economic  capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks for our business segments 
these risks include slower economic activity and investment in construction projects that make use of our products and services 
these economic developments  particularly decreased credit availability  have reduced demand for solar products  including our solar laminates  and for the solar development and installation services of sit 
further  these conditions have caused some of our customers to be unable to fully comply with the terms of their agreements to purchase our solar laminates 
continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability may adversely impact our existing or future business and require that we reallocate product shipments from customers who are unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to other customers or pursue other remedies  including contract renegotiation 
the decline in polysilicon prices  and the increase in the global capacity of pv products  is causing downward pressure on the prices of our products  resulting in lower revenues and earnings 
polysilicon  a key raw material for traditional crystalline pv products  is readily available to solar cell and module manufacturers after several years of short supply and prices have been falling rapidly 
these price reductions by our competitors are resulting in price reductions of solar cells and modules that compete with our laminates 
while we believe our laminates have unique characteristics that make them attractive for a variety of applications  particularly bipv installations  the market price decline of competitive products is resulting in downward pressure on our pricing that negatively impacts our revenues and earnings 
we have instituted demand creation initiatives that are extending our business model and subjecting us to additional business and financial risks 
we have instituted demand creation initiatives in our united solar ovonic segment to stimulate demand for our products 
certain of these initiatives  such as offering project financing and acquiring sit  extend our existing business model in this segment from principally manufacturing and selling laminates through our channel partners to include development  design  installation  financing and ownership of pv projects 
as a result  these initiatives will expose us to additional business risks  such as credit risks project financing and project construction and performance risks  which may be significant 
some of these initiatives  such as project financing  are capital intensive  and there can be no assurances that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meaningfully stimulate demand 
additionally  certain of these initiatives will require us to redeploy our capital resources from other initiatives  such as our manufacturing expansion  which may impair our ability to pursue these other initiatives and realize their benefits 
further  there can be no assurance that these initiatives will successfully stimulate demand for our products 
in response to market conditions  we have instituted capital expenditure and cost reduction initiatives that are impacting our financial performance and our cash resources  and will continue to do so in the future 

table of contents we have instituted a number of cost reduction initiatives to improve our cost structure and preserve capital in response to market conditions 
we have incurred restructuring expenses as a result of certain of these activities and may incur additional restructuring expenses as we pursue further cost reduction activities in the future 
in addition  in response to market conditions  we temporarily suspended our manufacturing expansion in our united solar ovonic segment and reduced our production in this segment 
we recognized under absorption of overhead costs resulting from our production adjustments and may recognize similar costs in the future if we do not operate our facilities at production capacity 
if our production levels and related cash flows remain at reduced levels we may be required to record an additional impairment to our property  plant and equipment  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that market demand will align with our present manufacturing capacity and  as a result  our business could be materially adversely affected 
volatility in customer demand in the solar industry could affect future levels of sales and profitability and limit our ability to predict such levels  if we are unable to balance our production levels with customer demand  our business and financial results will be materially adversely impacted 
in june  in order to meet increasing demand for our products  we announced the active expansion of our production capacity and the commencement of a plan to reach gigawatt gw of annual production capacity by in march of  we announced that we were slowing the pace of our demand driven production and expansion plan to better reflect the present impact of credit availability on project flow in the global pipeline for photovoltaics 
in connection with this announcement we delayed expansion at our greenville facility and battle creek facility  which will reduce our capital expenditures and allow us to preserve and  in strategic situations  redeploy our capital in other areas 
when market conditions and visibility improve  we believe that we can quickly re initiate our manufacturing expansion  as a result of the operational improvements we have made with respect to the construction and ramp of new facilities 
in the meantime  however  we will have to ensure that we balance our production levels with demand for our products 
if we are unable to balance our production levels with customer demand  our business and financial results will be materially adversely impacted 
historically  we have maintained moderate lead times  which has enabled customers to place orders close to their true needs for product 
in defining our financial goals and projections  we consider inventory on hand  backlog  production cycles and expected order patterns from customers 
if our estimates in these areas become inaccurate  we may not be able to meet our revenue goals and projections 
in addition  some customers require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment  even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even some  of the products 
as a result  in any quarterly fiscal period we are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a fall off of sales and backlog 
further  those orders may be for products that meet the customer s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would  in addition  result in an inventory of unsaleable products  and thus potential inventory write offs 
we routinely estimate inventory reserves required for such products  but actual results may differ from these reserve estimates 
if these differences are material  our business and financial results will be materially adversely impacted 
we have acquired sit to extend our business model and enhance our competitiveness  but we face integration and other related risks arising from this acquisition that could expose us to liability or cause us not to achieve these benefits 

table of contents our ability to successfully integrate the sit operations involves numerous risks  including designing and implementing internal controls over financial reporting at those locations 
however  we may not be able to integrate sit successfully into our existing business and could incur or assume unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of this acquisition or fail to realize the expected improvements in our engineering and technical capabilities or responsiveness to market opportunities 
we also may lose some laminate sales from customers who choose to withdraw business from us because they perceive sit to be a competitor of theirs 
if any of these possibilities occur  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we face intense competition from other companies producing solar energy and other renewable energy products 
the solar energy market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
the number of solar energy product manufacturers is rapidly increasing due to the growth of actual and forecast demand for solar energy products and the relatively low barriers to entry 
if we fail to attract and retain customers in our target markets for our current and future core products  namely solar laminates  we will be unable to increase our revenue and market share 
some of our competitors have established more prominent market positions  and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish successful distribution networks in our target markets for our products  we will be unable to increase our sales 
in addition  many of our competitors manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon solar modules which are currently sold at lower cost and have higher conversion efficiency than our solar laminates 
we may also face competition from new entrants to the solar energy market  including those that offer more advanced technological solutions or that have greater financial resources 
a significant number of our competitors are developing or currently producing products based on more advanced solar energy technologies  including amorphous silicon  string ribbon  copper indium gallium di selenide  and nano technologies  which may eventually offer cost and technology advantages over the technologies currently used by us 
a widespread adoption of any of these technologies could result in a rapid decline in our position in the solar energy market and our revenue if we fail to adopt such technologies or develop new technologies 
furthermore  the entire solar energy industry also faces competition from conventional energy for example a decline in base grid electricity prices  and non solar renewable energy providers 
due to the relatively high manufacturing costs compared to most other energy sources  solar energy is generally not competitive without government incentive programs 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and other resources than we do 
our competitors greater size in some cases provides them with a competitive advantage with respect to manufacturing because of their economies of scale and their ability to purchase raw materials at lower prices 
as a result  those competitors may have stronger bargaining power with their suppliers and may have an advantage over us in negotiating favorable pricing  as well as securing supplies in times of shortages 
many of our competitors also have greater brand name recognition  more established distribution networks  balance of system capabilities  and larger customer bases 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential distributors and have extensive knowledge of our target markets 
as a result  they may be able to devote more resources to the research  development  promotion and sale of their products  or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can 
our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our customers increasingly need financing to purchase our products  which exposes us to additional business and credit risks 

table of contents availability and cost of financing are significant factors that affect demand for our products 
developers and owners of solar facilities typically require project financing before initiating a solar installation 
roofing contractors and other solar integrators must obtain working capital financing to carry inventory of our products and maintain their operations 
historically most of our customers have arranged their own financing without assistance from us  but with the illiquidity of current financing markets some of our customers have sought various forms of credit support from us 
from time to time we may provide credit support to certain customers through open account sales or extended payment terms 
due to our size and capital constraints  we are not able to satisfy all credit requests by our customers 
these credit support transactions expose us to credit risk  including the risk of default by customers 
in addition  if we are unable to provide credit to our customers  or otherwise induce third parties to satisfy customer credit demands  we could lose sales and be unable to achieve our future business plan 
we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain  the failure to maintain sustainable profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses 
principally as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  our goal is to operate our business in such a way that profitability is sustainable over the long term 
nonetheless  we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability in the future  which in turn could materially and adversely impact our ability to repay our debt and could materially decrease the market value of our common stock and as a result  the value of our convertible senior notes 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase as we seek to continuously improve our manufacturing operations  whether domestically or internationally  service our debt obligations  develop our distribution network  continue to research and develop our products and manufacturing technologies  implement our demand creation initiatives  which may include project financing and strategic acquisitions  implement internal systems and infrastructure to support our growth  and retain key members of management and other personnel  and hire additional personnel 
we do not know whether our revenue will grow at all or grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited operating history under our current business strategy and new management team makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our operating results 
if we fail to achieve profitability  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we may incur future restructuring charges and long lived asset impairment losses 
we have recorded long lived asset impairment losses  including impairment losses for goodwill and intangible assets  and employee severance and restructuring charges 
generally  we record long lived asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets 
during  we recorded substantial long lived asset impairment losses and wrote off the entire balance of our goodwill and 
table of contents intangible assets 
in light of the continued volume reductions we have experienced  we may incur similar losses and charges in the future  and those losses and charges may be significant 
we have international operations  which we are expanding  that are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
we have a pv laminate manufacturing facility in tijuana  mexico  and have established a joint venture in tianjin  china  to manufacture pv laminates 
also  a portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
international operations and transactions are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including the potential that we may be forced to forfeit  voluntarily or involuntarily  foreign assets due to economic or political instability in the countries in which we choose to locate our manufacturing facilities  difficult and expensive compliance with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets  difficulty in interpreting and enforcing contracts governed by foreign law  which may be subject to multiple  conflicting and changing laws  regulations and tax systems  inability to obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  encountering trade barriers such as export requirements  tariffs  currency exchange controls  taxes and other restrictions and expenses  which could affect the competitive pricing of our solar laminates and reduce our market share in some countries  being subjected to additional withholding taxes or other tax on our foreign income or tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade and investment  including currency exchange controls  being subjected to fluctuations in exchange rates which may affect product demand and our profitability in us dollars to the extent the price of our solar laminates and cost of raw materials  labor and equipment is denominated in a foreign currency  limitations on dividends or restrictions against repatriation of earnings  difficulty in recruiting and retaining individuals skilled in international business operations  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  and potentially adverse tax consequences associated with our permanent establishment of operations in more countries 
in addition  since expanding our business globally is an important element of our strategy  our exposure to these risks will be greater in the future 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
however  any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our profitability 

table of contents demand for our products is affected by existing regulations concerning the electrical utility industry  changes to such regulations may present technical  regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products  which may significantly reduce demand for our products 
the market for electricity generation products is influenced heavily by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry  as well as internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities 
these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer owned electricity generation 
in the united states at both the national level and the state and local level and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified 
customer purchases of  or further investment in the research and development of  alternative energy sources  including solar power technology  could be deterred by these regulations and policies  which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar power products 
for example  utility companies commonly charge fees to larger  industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back up purposes 
these fees could increase the cost to our customers of using our solar power products and make them less desirable  thereby harming our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate that our solar power products and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national  state and local laws and ordinances relating to building codes  safety  environmental protection  utility interconnection and metering and related matters 
there is also a burden in having to track the requirements of individual countries and states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards 
any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar power products may result in significant additional expenses to us and our resellers and their customers and  as a result  could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar power products 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers 
we historically have entered into agreements with a relatively small number of major customers throughout the world 
our five largest customers represented approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
any loss or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers would be difficult to recoup from other customers and could have an adverse effect on our sales  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the reduction or elimination of government incentives related to solar power could cause our revenues to decline 
today  the cost of solar power exceeds the cost of power furnished by the electric utility grid in most locations 
as a result  federal  state and local government bodies in many countries  most notably germany  japan  italy  spain  france  greece  china  canada and the united states  have provided incentives in the form of feed in tariffs  rebates  tax credits and other incentives to end users  distributors  system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products to promote the use of solar energy to reduce dependency on other forms of energy 
some of these government mandates and economic incentives have expired  are scheduled to be reduced or expire  or could be eliminated altogether 
reductions in  or eliminations or expirations of  incentives related to solar power could result in decreased demand for our solar laminates or result in increased price competition  and lower our revenue 

table of contents the expansion of our business into new markets  such as residential  may increase our exposure to certain risks  including class action claims 
we are developing and have launched new applications of our solar technology  including solar laminates to be integrated into residential roofing materials 
our new solar technology applications may not gain market acceptance and we may not otherwise be successful in entering new markets  including the market for residential applications 
moreover  entry into new markets may increase our exposure to certain risks that we currently face or expose us to new risks 
for example  the residential construction market for solar energy systems is exposed to different risks than the commercial construction markets  including more acute seasonality  sensitivity to interest rates  and other macroeconomic conditions  as well as aesthetics and enhanced legal exposure 
in particular  new home developments can result in class action litigation when one or more homes in a development experience problems with roofing or power systems 
if we penetrate the residential market and experience product failures that create property damage or personal injury  we may be exposed to greater liability of a different nature than with respect to product failures in commercial building applications 
we have focused our business strategy on  and invested significant financial resources in  the bipv segment of the pv market and there is no guarantee that the demand for bipv systems will develop as we anticipate 
our recent business strategy has focused on increasing demand for bipv systems 
we believe that there has been an increase in demand for bipv systems based in part on increasing interest and customer support from the building industry  solar customers and governments 
as a result  we have invested  and will continue to invest  significant financial resources in the production and commercialization of our solar laminates for bipv systems 
if the bipv segment does not develop as we anticipate  or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  we may experience difficulties implementing our growth and business targets 
this in turn could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we may be unable to obtain key raw materials that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements 
the key raw materials used in our business are stainless steel  resin based polymers  nickel and high purity industrial gases  primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane 
most of our key raw materials are readily available from numerous sources  however we have  in certain instances  selected single source suppliers for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost and quality 
our supply chain and operations could be adversely impacted by the failure of the suppliers of the single sourced materials to provide us with the raw materials that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements 
in addition  significant shortages or price increases in raw materials that are not single sourced may adversely impact our business 
any constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our obligations under customer purchase orders  and any increase in the price of raw materials could constrain our margins  either of which would adversely impact our financial results 
we actively manage our raw materials and other supply costs through purchasing strategies  product design and operating improvements  however our management may not always be effective  which could adversely impact our supply chain and financial condition 
some of our suppliers may be unable to supply our demand for raw materials and components 
in such event  we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use in our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
raw materials and components from new suppliers also may be less suited for our technology and yield solar laminates with lower conversion efficiencies  higher failure rates and higher 
table of contents rates of degradation than solar laminates manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers 
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar laminates or increase our manufacturing cost  either of which would adversely impact our prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
significant warranty and product liability claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our solar laminates or pv systems fail to perform as expected or if a failure of our solar laminates or pv systems results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury  property damage or other damages 
since our solar laminates and pv systems are electricity producing devices  it is possible that our products could result in injury  whether by product malfunctions  defects  improper installation or other causes 
in addition  because the products we are developing incorporate new technologies and use new installation methods  we cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or the effect of any resulting negative publicity on our business 
as a result of our acquisition of sit  we may be subject to warranty and product liability claims associated with the manufacture  sale and installation of products by sit before the acquisition 
moreover  we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us 
our current standard product warranty for our solar laminates ranges from years 
we believe our warranty periods are competitive with industry practice 
due to the long warranty period and our proprietary technology  we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have shipped product and recognized revenue 
although we test our solar power products for reliability and durability  we cannot ensure that we effectively simulate the year warranty period 
any increase in the defect rate of our products would cause us to increase the amount of warranty reserves and have a corresponding negative impact on our financial results 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages 
in addition  quality issues can have various other ramifications  including delays in the recognition of revenue  loss of revenue  loss of future sales opportunities  increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products  and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation 
the possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expenses to repair or replace defective products 
furthermore  widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and reduce our market share and cause sales to decline 
the conversion rate of our outstanding convertible debt is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock and thus the dilutive impact of the future converted shares cannot be predicted 
except in the instance of specific events involving the price of the company s common stock  the price of the convertible senior notes notes  and certain corporate transactions  our outstanding convertible debt is not convertible until march  the holders of the notes may convert the principal amount of their notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of the company s common stock initially at a conversion rate of shares equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share per  principal amount of the notes 
the holders of the notes are only entitled to amounts in excess of the principal amount if shares of the company s common stock exceed a market price of for a period of consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period 
since we cannot predict the future trading price of our common stock  we cannot 
table of contents estimate the number of shares that will be issued at the time of conversion and the effect of those shares on the trading price of the common stock or the effect on earnings per share 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of the senior management team and of a limited number of skilled managers  scientists and technicians 
the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our success will depend upon  among other factors  the recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing employees or to attract and retain additional personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel in industrial  academic and nonprofit research sectors 
we may become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings which may reach unfavorable resolutions 
we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of legal proceedings  the outcome of any such proceeding could be unfavorable  and we may choose to make payments or enter into other arrangements to settle such proceedings 
failure to settle such proceedings could require us to pay damages or other expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have been subject to legal proceedings in the past involving the validity and enforceability of certain of our patents 
while such patent related legal proceedings have been resolved  such proceedings can require the expenditure of substantial management time and financial resources and can adversely affect our financial performance 
there can be no assurance that we will not be a party to other legal proceedings in the future 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals that may expose us to liability and other compliance risks 
although we believe that we are in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances into the environment 
in addition  we generate hazardous materials and other wastes that are disposed of at licensed disposal facilities 
we may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 

table of contents our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology including our trade secrets and other confidential information 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for products based on our technologies 
our policy is to seek to protect our products and technologies by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our ability to maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted 
we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents 
our issued patents and those that we may issue in the future may be challenged  invalidated  rendered unenforceable or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products and technologies 
in addition  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar products or technologies 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property 
because of the extensive time required for development and commercialization of products based on our technologies  it is possible that  before these products can be commercialized  any related patents may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization  thereby reducing any advantages of these patents and making it unlikely that we will be able to recover investments we have made to develop our technologies and products based on our technologies 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  agents and consultants upon the commencement of their relationships with us 
these agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
our agreements with employees also provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property 
individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms 
in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
to the extent that our employees or consultants use technology or know how owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions 
adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information 
the disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 

table of contents we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents 
to counter infringement or unauthorized use  we may be required to file patent infringement claims  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
interference proceedings brought by the united states patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
in addition  during the course of this litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may not prevail in any litigation or interference proceeding in which we are involved 
even if we do prevail  these proceedings can be expensive and distract our management 
third parties may own or control patents or patent applications that are infringed by our products or technologies 
our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents and proprietary rights 
in the united states and most other countries  patent applications are published months after filing 
as a result  there may be patents of which we are unaware  and avoiding patent infringement may be difficult 
we may inadvertently infringe third party patents or patent applications 
these third parties could bring claims against us that  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if resolved against us  could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we and our joint venture partners and licensees could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of products based on our technologies in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe  unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder 
such a license may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with products based on our technologies 
even if we were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages to the patent holder in the event of an infringement 
under some circumstances in the united states  these damages could be triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs 
if we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing or licensed third parties to manufacture  use or market infringing products  we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for 
table of contents any losses the third parties may sustain themselves as the result of lost sales or damages paid to the patent holder 
any successful infringement action brought against us may also adversely affect marketing of products based on our technologies in other markets not covered by the infringement action 
furthermore  we may suffer adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal  nullified through another action or resolved by settlement with the patent holder 
the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  may be significant 
as a result  any infringement action against us would likely harm our competitive position  be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive  and noncompliance with these regulations may require us to pay substantial fines  suspend production or cease operations 
the operation of our manufacturing facilities entails the use and handling of potentially harmful substances  including toxic and explosive gases that pose inherent risks of environmental damage or personal injury 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with environmental regulations  rules and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances into the environment 
we may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances into the environment by our operations 
for example  our manufacturing process involves the controlled storage and use of silane and germane gases  both of which are toxic and combustible 
although we have rigorous safety procedures for handling these materials  the risk of accidental injury from such hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated 
if we have an accident at one of our facilities involving a release of these substances  we may be subject to civil and or criminal penalties  including financial penalties and damages  and possibly injunctions preventing us from continuing our operations 
in addition  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
to date such laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our operations  and we believe that we have all necessary permits to conduct operations as they are presently conducted 
if more stringent laws and regulations are adopted in the future  the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations could be substantial 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  third party lawsuits  and suspension of production or cessation of operations 
we have entered into joint ventures and licensing agreements to develop and commercialize products based on our technologies and we must manage such joint ventures and licensing agreements successfully 
we have entered into licensing and joint venture agreements in order to develop and commercialize certain products based on our technologies 
any revenue or profits that may be derived by us from these agreements will be substantially dependent upon our ability to agree with our joint venture partners and licensees about the management and operation of the joint ventures and license agreements 
in addition  any revenue or profits from such agreements will be substantially dependent on the willingness and ability of our joint venture partners and licensees to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will agree regarding the operation of such joint ventures and licensing agreements  that 
table of contents required financial resources will be available on mutually agreeable terms or that commercialization efforts will be successful 
if we and our joint venture partners and licensees are unable to agree with respect to the operation of our joint ventures and licensing agreements  are unwilling or unable to devote financial resources or are unable to commercialize products based on our technologies  we may not be able to realize revenue and profits based on our technologies and our business could be materially adversely affected 
our government product development and research contracts may be terminated by unilateral government action  or we may be unsuccessful in obtaining new government contracts to replace those that have been terminated or completed 
we have several government product development and research contracts 
any revenue or profits that may be derived by us from these contracts will be substantially dependent upon the government agencies willingness to continue to devote their financial resources to our research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such financial resources will be available or that such research and development efforts will be successful 
our government contracts may be terminated for the convenience of the government at any time  even if we have fully performed our obligations under the contracts 
upon a termination for convenience  we would generally only be entitled to recover certain eligible costs and expenses we had incurred prior to termination and would not be entitled to any other payments or damages 
therefore  if government product development and research contracts are terminated or completed and we are unsuccessful in obtaining replacement government contracts  our revenue and profits may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
the credit facility entered into by our subsidiaries  united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc  contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
we conduct substantially all of our united solar ovonic segment operations through our subsidiaries united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc 
for example  our cash flows from that segment are dependent on the distributions to us by united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc 
in february  united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc entered into a secured credit facility with an aggregate commitment of up to million  of which we are a guarantor 
the credit facility contains  and any other future debt agreements may contain  covenant restrictions that may effectively limit our ability to operate our business  due to restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees  create liens  make certain investments  enter into transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  make certain restricted payments  declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders  and merge or consolidate with any person 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us due to the restrictions imposed by the credit facility 
in addition  the failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default  which could permit the lenders and debt holders to accelerate such debt 

table of contents our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change under the internal revenue code  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of our past financial performance  we have significant operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards which expire from to section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change 
an ownership change for purposes of section of the code generally refers to any change in ownership of more than of the company s stock over a three year period 
these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning  directly or indirectly  or more of the stock of a company or any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of the company s stock 
if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section as a result of future transactions involving our common stock  including purchases or sales of stock between our greater than stockholders  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to the limitations of section depending on the resulting limitations  a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 
our inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding 
our indebtedness  along with our other contractual commitments  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as our ability to meet any of our payment obligations 
together with our subsidiaries  we have a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements 
as of june   we have approximately million face value of outstanding debt 
this level of debt and related debt service could have significant consequences on our future operations  including making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations  resulting in an event of default if we and our subsidiaries fail to comply with covenants contained in our debt agreements  which could result in such debt becoming immediately due and payable  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates  including borrowings under our credit facility  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business  the industry in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and our ability to meet our payment obligations 
our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available 
table of contents to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance or restructure our debt  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments  or seek to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives  we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our debt and other obligations 
we may be unable to remediate our material weakness related to the accuracy of the adjustment to value inventory at actual cost 
in the fourth quarter we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the adjustment we make to value inventory at actual cost 
this failure and any failure in the future to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and otherwise comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our business 
such noncompliance could result in perceptions of our business among customers  suppliers  lenders  investors  securities analysts and others being adversely affected 
we may not be able to complete our remediation plans designed to address the identified material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and continue to simplify and automate the accounting for standard cost and cost variances 
the failure to successfully complete our remediation plans could adversely affect our business

overview we design  manufacture and sell photovoltaic pv products  known as pv or solar laminates that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
solar sales represent more than of our revenues 
we also receive fees and royalties from licensees of our nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology  sell high performance nickel hydroxide used in nimh batteries  and receive funds for product development agreements under government sponsored programs 
in august  we acquired sit  a company that manufactures  designs  and installs building integrated pv systems for commercial rooftops 
as a result of this acquisition  we are transitioning our business from manufacturing and selling our pv products to a company that provides complete solar solutions  project implementation and value added services 
the sit business is included in our united solar ovonic segment 
the following key factors should be considered when reviewing our results for the periods discussed our consolidated financial results are driven primarily by the performance of our united solar ovonic segment 
our united solar ovonic segment accounted for and of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
our united solar ovonic segment generated an operating loss of million and operating income of million in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
given the size of this segment relative to our other business activities  our overall success in the foreseeable future will be aligned primarily with the performance of our united solar ovonic segment and subject to the risks of that business 
global economic  capital markets and credit disruptions have significantly impacted current market conditions in the solar market and created uncertainty  but we believe that credit market conditions will continue to improve 
we also believe that a strong interest in alternative energy in general and solar in particular remains  but global financial constraints experienced during impacted the funding of solar projects that otherwise have strong strategic rationale and or financial returns 
our business has also been adversely impacted by related weakness in the construction market  because we have historically focused on building integrated pv through our building materials channel  which in turn relies on new roof and re roof sales 
current macroeconomic conditions  including the global economic crisis  are adversely impacting our customers  including some customers who are unable to fully comply with take or pay agreements  and  as a result  our revenues and net income are likewise adversely impacted 
we are working with our customers to preserve relationships and maximize long term value by  among other things  reallocating product shipments to other customers and pursuing other remedies including contract renegotiations  as appropriate on a case by case basis 
we also continue to be encouraged by the opportunities for large scale restructuring of the energy infrastructure to increase emphasis on renewable energy  such as our solar laminates 
countries around the world are demonstrating support for the adoption of solar energy through renewable portfolio standards and feed in tariffs 

table of contents we are also responding to these market conditions by transforming our business model and enhancing our competitiveness as described below we are expanding our business by continuing to enhance our focus on our projects business to supplement our channel strategy  and introducing new product applications to expand our addressable markets to include residential and building applied solutions 
during fiscal year  in response to market conditions that impaired demand for our products through our existing channels to market  we transformed our business model to include projects activities  including direct sales on large projects and turnkey systems 
these project sales allow us to compete more effectively for large scale projects by providing a sophisticated  turnkey solution that addresses the key elements of these projects  including site control  financing which we typically arrange through third parties  and energy offtake and project execution 
additionally  during fiscal year  we extended our product reach  announcing a new residential product through a joint development relationship and our new powertilt solution for the building applied market 
we did not previously significantly participate in these markets  and we believe that there are considerable opportunities to leverage our product differentiation in these markets including low impact and lightweight to generate sales 
we are increasing production in our united solar ovonic segment and reducing costs to respond to improve our overall competitiveness 
during fiscal  we transformed our business model to include projects activities as described above and moderated our production in response to market conditions that impaired demand for our products through our existing channels to market 
our cost per watt increased during the fiscal year as a result of the reduced production  primarily due to unabsorbed overhead costs 
we are now re ramping production based on traction with our new business model and improving market conditions 
we expect to see reduced cost per watt from better factory utilization 
we are at the same aggressively focusing on various cost per watt reductions 
for example  during fiscal year  we will introduce materials savings and enhancements to our laminates  resulting from manufacturing and quality improvements 
as a result  we expect to substantially reduce our cost per watt during fiscal year we will further lower product cost per watt  and increase conversion efficiency  through our technology roadmap 

table of contents we are operating our ovonic materials segment profitably and are continuing to realize value from our technology portfolio 
we have developed proprietary technologies in our ovonic materials segment that we believe have value  including technologies for advanced nimh batteries  solid hydrogen storage  metal hydride fuel cells  and bio reformation 
the development activities for these technologies have been substantially balanced with external sources of revenues  such as royalties and development agreements principally government contracts  to align our development commercialization efforts at sustainable levels 
we are continually evaluating commercialization opportunities and strategic alternatives to maximize value for these technologies  which may include licenses  joint ventures  and sales 
we completed the disposition of our cobasys joint venture interest  but retained certain technology and royalty rights  including regaining exclusive stationary nimh rights  subject to preexisting agreements 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance in evaluating our business  we use product and system sales  gross profit  pre tax income  earnings per share  net income  cash flow from operations and other key performance metrics 
we also use production and shipments  both measured in megawatts mw  and gross margins on product sales as key performance metrics for our united solar ovonic segment  particularly in connection with the manufacturing operations in this segment 

table of contents results of operations we have two segments  united solar ovonic and ovonic materials

these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in product development contract revenue due to the successful completion of certain contracts and increased cost share for ongoing contracts 
cost of product sales decreased million for this decrease was primarily due to decreased costs for nickel  the primary cost in our nickel hydroxide manufacturing process 
combined cost of revenues from product development agreements and product development and research expenses decreased by million in the decrease was primarily due to reduced research and development expenses resulting from reduced headcount and the completion of certain product development contracts

the increase in total revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in pv product sales of million  the impact of which was partially offset by a price declines and product mix of million 
the cost of product sales increased million reflecting higher product sales volume  and the operating costs associated with the expansion of our production capacity in our greenville  michigan facility in the first half of fiscal year 
table of contents the cost of product sales increased in primarily due to the previously mentioned sales volume increase  which resulted in million of additional cost  as well as increased inventory reserves of million  higher warranty costs of million and associated period costs of million  caused by the under absorption of fixed overhead costs resulting from our declines of sales and production in the second half of fiscal these additional costs were offset in part by lower raw material costs and improved efficiencies in our manufacturing processes  which in total amounted to million resulting in increased margins on product sales from in to in combined cost of revenues from product development agreements and product development and research expenses increased by million in this additional cost was partially offset by increased revenues from product development agreements of million

selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate operations  including human resources  legal  finance  strategy  information technology  business development  and corporate governance 
the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to lower salaries  wages and related expenses  lower supplies and professional fees  offset by stock and option award amortization 
net loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment increased in fiscal year to million 
we were unable to sell certain assets previously classified as assets held for sale and determined these assets no longer met the criteria for classification as assets held for sale 
as a result  we reclassified these assets as held and used and recognized a loss of million 
the decline in restructuring charges in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to lower severance and facility related costs associated with our earlier business realignment activities 
most of the restructuring which began in fiscal was completed during fiscal as a result  restructuring charges decreased by million during the year ended june  other income expense other income expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year the change was principally due to increased interest expense reflecting a full year s interest on our convertible senior notes of million  a reduction in the level of investments and lower interest rates in fiscal which reduced interest income by million  foreign currency losses of million  investment losses of million reduced by insurance proceeds of million in fiscal income taxes income tax expense was million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in tax expense is primarily related to taxes incurred for alternative minimum tax in the us of million  state taxes in the us of million and an increase in foreign income taxes in germany and mexico 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and borrowing available under our credit facility 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents and investments and borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for our current operations and planned capital expenditures during the fiscal year 
however  during fiscal year we intend to consider certain transactions to enhance our liquidity and address longer term capital needs  including maturity of our convertible notes and full implementation of our technology road map 
at june   we had consolidated working capital of million 
as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consisting of floating rate corporate notes frns  corporate notes  us government agency notes  auction rate certificates arcs  and auction rate securities rights 
in october  we agreed to an offer from ubs ag ubs to sell at par value  at anytime from june  through july   the arcs purchased from ubs which represent the entire portfolio of our arcs 
these auction rate securities rights arsrs  which are akin to a freestanding put option  are non transferable and are not traded on any exchange 
we currently classify the arcs as short term investments 
on june   we elected to exercise our right to sell the remaining arcs to ubs and liquidate our arsrs 
these transactions settled in july our valuations of arcs and arsrs are based on unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and therefore require us to develop our own assumptions 
for additional information about our judgments and assumption underlying our fair value measurements and details about the methodology and inputs used see note fair value measurements to our notes to the consolidated financial statements and information about the sensitivity of our measurements in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash flows year ended june  compared to year ended june  net cash used in provided by our operating activities was million in compared to million in the decrease was driven by a reduction in our net income loss adjusted for non cash items of million offset by million cash used for changes in net working capital  specifically due to inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in this increase was principally due to reduced capital expenditures of million  reduced investment purchases of million  increased proceeds from maturities and sales of our investments of million  offset by million of developmental loans 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in this decrease was principally due to the million repayment of the revolving credit facility and million repayment of the convertible notes assumed as part of the sit acquisition 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  net cash provided by our operating activities was million in compared to million in the operating cash flows in our united solar ovonic segment were negatively impacted by the change in working capital as we expand sales activities  extend payment terms to certain customers  develop project financing capabilities for new projects and fund our inventory and accounts receivable growth 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in the corresponding period in this increase was principally due to increased purchases of investments and increased capital spending principally associated with expenditures for the expansion of our united solar ovonic segment s manufacturing capacity during the first half of fiscal because of adverse market conditions  we significantly curtailed our production capacity and expansion plans in the third quarter of fiscal year net cash provided by our financing activities was million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of proceeds from the june convertible debt and equity offerings 
short term borrowings we maintain a million revolving line of credit to finance domestic activities and a separate million revolving line of credit provided under the united states export import bank s fast track working capital guarantee program to finance foreign activities 
availability of financing under the lines of credit will be determined a borrowing base comprised of domestic and foreign inventory and receivables  respectively 
at june   there was approximately million of available financing under the agreement based on the borrowing formula 
at june   there were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
the credit facilities also contain an aggregate million sub limit for standby letters of credit  which count against the available financing described above and there were approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding at june  we are presently considering implementing alternative credit facilities to better meet our needs which may involve early termination of these lines 
convertible senior notes our convertible senior notes notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable on june and december of each year 
if the notes are not converted  they will mature on june  the notes are only convertible prior to march  under specific circumstances involving the price of our common stock  the price of the notes and certain corporate transactions including  but not limited to  an offering of common stock at a price less than market  a distribution of cash or other assets to stockholders  a merger  consolidation or other share exchange  or a change in control 
the holders of the notes may convert the principal amount of their notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock initially at a conversion rate of shares equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share per  principal amount of the notes 
the holders of the notes are only entitled to amounts in excess of the principal amount if shares of our common stock exceed a market price of for a period of consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period 
the applicable conversion rate will be subject to adjustments in certain circumstances 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of ecd and rank equal in right of payment with any future senior unsecured debt of ecd  and senior in right of payment to all of ecd s existing and future debt  if any  that is subordinated to the notes 
in may  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our notes whereby we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in exchange for an aggregate of principal amount of million held by the holders of the notes 
in connection with this exchange we recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of million 
during fiscal year we expect to consider additional debt for equity exchanges and other transactions to reduce the outstanding principal of our notes prior to their maturity 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet financing consists primarily of operating leases for equipment and property 
these leases have terms ranging from a month to month basis to years 
we incurred lease expense of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively

our contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands convertible senior notes structured financing capital lease obligations interest on convertible senior notes  structured financing  and capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately million during fiscal year  primarily for projects included in the technology roadmap 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note nature of operations  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
however  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be significant if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of our inventory based upon assumptions about anticipated customer demand and future market conditions 
the key factors we consider when estimating our inventory 
table of contents reserve include historical sales  anticipated demand  expected sales price  market trends  product obsolescence  the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products and other factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
inventory reserves were million and million at june  and  respectively 
warranty reserve we generally provide a year product warranty on power output on all solar product sales 
we estimate our warranty liability based on past experience of claims and claims paid as well as our engineering and laboratory tests of our product under different conditions and then apply that knowledge to the installed base of solar product sales 
at june  and  the company had recorded a liability for future warranty claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
for installed solar systems  we generally provide a year roof membrane warranty  a year power warranty and a year warranty on inverters 
in addition  we generally provide a year product warranty on our building integrated photovoltaic bipv product 
reserves for warranty costs are recognized at the date of sale of the relevant products  at management s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liability  taking into account the specific arrangements of the transaction and past experience 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts and consider a number of factors  when estimating the allowance including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  trade credit insurance coverage  previous payment and loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation  and our knowledge of the customer and the customer s business 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at june  and  respectively 
accounting for business combinations we recorded all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including goodwill and other intangible assets  at fair value as of the date of the acquisition 
the determination of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed required us to make significant estimates and assumptions that are highly judgmental and affect our financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
our assessment utilizes quoted market prices  fair value appraisals  management forecasts and discounted cash flow analyses 
the impairment analysis is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions have a substantial impact on the amount of any impairment loss recorded 
discounted cash flow analyses are dependent upon management estimates and assumptions of future sales trends  current and expected future economic trends  market conditions and the effects of new technologies 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with our business plan  however  actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 

table of contents share based compensation we record the fair value of stock based compensation grants as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
we use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
with regard to the weighted average option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees 
forfeiture rates are based on our historical data for stock option forfeitures

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
interest rate risk our investments in financial instruments are comprised of debt securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities  or commodities  or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio corporate notes and us government agency notes represents funds held temporarily  pending use in our business and operations 
we had million of these investments as of june  it is our policy that investments shall be rated a or higher by moody s or standard and poor s  no single investment shall represent more than of the portfolio and at least of the total portfolio shall have maturities of days or less 
our market risk primarily relates to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
an interest rate increase or decrease of would increase or decrease the value of our portfolio by approximately million  as of june  our notes are subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
since the notes are convertible to common stock  as the fair market value of our common stock increases  so will the fair market value of the notes 
conversely  as the fair market value of our common stock decreases  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as well 
as interest rates rise  the fair market value of the notes will decrease and as interest rates fall  the fair market value of the notes will increase 
at june   the estimated fair market value of our notes was approximately million 
an increase or decrease in market interest rates of would increase or decrease the fair value of our notes by approximately million 
foreign exchange risk we primarily conduct our business in us dollars  which may impact our foreign customers and suppliers as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 
these factors may adversely impact our existing or future sales agreements and require us to reallocate product shipments or pursue other remedies 
the majority of sit s sales in europe are denominated in euros while the related costs of sales are denominated in euros and us dollars 
an increase or a decrease in exchange rates of would increase or decrease our foreign currency transaction gain by approximately million 
we recognized a net foreign currency transaction loss of million and million at june  and  respectively
