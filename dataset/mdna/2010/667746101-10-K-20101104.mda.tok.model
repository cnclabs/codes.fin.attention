item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
ineffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  based on the framework in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
based upon our consideration of the issues identified in the audit committee investigation and our related accounting analyses  we have determined that certain material weaknesses in our internal controls existed as of december  for a description of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our plan to remediate those material weaknesses  see part ii item a  controls and procedures of this form k 
in addition  as a result of the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls  we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  ii 
table of contents part i item business we are a leading north american manufacturer of large diameter  high pressure steel pipeline systems for use in water infrastructure applications  primarily related to drinking water systems 
our pipeline systems are also used for hydroelectric power systems  wastewater systems and other applications 
with a history that dates back more than years  we have established a leading position based on a strong  widely recognized reputation for quality and service and an extensive array of product offerings 
our manufacturing facilities in north america are strategically located to provide us with broad geographic coverage of our target markets  giving us competitive advantages in serving our customers 
we manufacture water infrastructure products through our water transmission group  which in  and generated approximately   and  respectively  of our net sales 
we market our water infrastructure products through an in house sales force 
our sales have historically been driven by the need for new water infrastructure  which is based primarily on overall population growth and population movement between regions 
we believe the need for new water infrastructure  upgrades  repairs and replacements will continue to be a significant demand factor for us 
in addition to manufacturing water infrastructure products  we also manufacture other welded steel products through our tubular products group  which in   and generated approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales 
tubular products are marketed through a network of direct sales force personnel  sales agents  and independent distributors 
our tubular products group has the capability to manufacture a broad array of small diameter  electric resistance welded erw steel pipe for use in a wide range of applications  including energy  construction  agricultural  industrial  and traffic signpost systems 
we have also invested in an unconsolidated subsidiary  northwest pipe asia  located in singapore 
northwest pipe asia has established temporary operations in batam  indonesia to produce structural piling to be supplied to a construction project in singapore 
our industries water transmission 
the us market for water delivery equipment and systems is estimated to be approximately billion annually 
within this market  we focus on engineered pipeline systems that utilize large diameter  high pressure steel pipe 
in addition to these water infrastructure applications  our water transmission group manufactures products for certain structural piling applications and in plant pipeline systems for power plants and other industrial applications 
we believe the current addressable market for the products sold by our water transmission group will total approximately billion over the next three years 
our core market is the large diameter  high pressure portion of the pipeline that is typically at the upper end of a pipeline system 
this is the portion of the overall water pipeline that generally transports water from the source to a treatment plant or from a treatment plant into the distribution system  rather than the small lines that deliver water directly into households 
a combination of population growth  movement to new population centers  dwindling supplies from developed water sources  substantial underinvestment in water infrastructure over the past several decades  and an increasingly stringent regulatory environment are driving demand for water infrastructure projects in the united states 
these trends are increasing the need for new water infrastructure as well as the need to upgrade  repair and replace existing water infrastructure  and we believe this offers potential for increased demand for our water infrastructure products and other products related to water transmission and distribution 
the primary drivers of growth in new water infrastructure installation are population growth and movement and dwindling supplies from developed water sources 
according to the us census bureau  the population of the united states will increase by over million people between and the resulting increase in 
table of contents demand will require substantial new infrastructure  as the existing us water infrastructure is not equipped to provide water to millions of new residents 
the combination of population growth and movement is projected to result in approximately million new residents in the southern and western regions of the united states 
in addition  many current water supply sources are in danger of being exhausted 
the development of new sources of water at greater distances from population centers will drive the demand for new water transmission lines 
our manufacturing facilities are well located to take advantage of the anticipated growth and demand in these regions 
much of the us water infrastructure is antiquated and many authorities  including the us environmental protection agency the epa  believe the us water infrastructure is in critical need of updates  repairs or replacements 
the american society of civil engineers has given poor ratings to many aspects of the us water infrastructure in their report card for america s infrastructure 
in the fourth national assessment of public water system infrastructure  the epa in estimated that a total investment of approximately billion will be needed to install  upgrade and replace infrastructure over the next years 
the epa estimates that approximately billion of this needed investment applies to the rehabilitation or replacement of deteriorated or undersized water transmission and distribution infrastructure components 
increased public awareness of problems with the quality of drinking water and efficient water usage has resulted in more stringent application of federal and state environmental regulations 
the need to comply with these regulations in an environment of heightened public awareness towards water issues is expected to contribute to demand in the water infrastructure industry over the next several years 
water systems will need to be installed  upgraded and replaced in order to satisfy these water quality laws and regulations 
tubular products 
the tubular products industry encompasses a wide variety of products serving a diverse group of end markets 
we have been active in several of these markets  including energy pipe  standard pipe  structural pipe and traffic signpost systems 
in  the tubular products industry experienced an oversaturation of imported pipe and a collapse of natural gas prices in a very short time frame 
in addition  non residential construction declined 
these factors had a severe negative impact on all of our tubular products 
however  we believe energy products offer significant growth opportunities in the near future  and we intend to capitalize on this potential 
in the fourth quarter of  we finalized installation of a pipe mill repositioned from our portland  oregon facility to our bossier city  louisiana facility 
this equipment provides expanded production for the energy market  namely  oil country tubular goods 
we began limited production of pipe for the oil country tubular goods market at this plant in the first quarter of certain pipe finishing and inspection processes are complete and are expected to be fully functioning by the end of during we redirected the focus of our houston  texas plant from mechanical tubing to energy pipe production and began production of energy pipe there in april products water transmission 
water transmission pipe is used for high pressure applications  typically requiring pipe to withstand pressures in excess of pounds per square inch 
most of our water transmission products are made to custom specifications and are for fully engineered  large diameter  high pressure water infrastructure systems 
other uses include pipe for piling and hydroelectric projects  wastewater transmission  treatment plants and other applications 
our primary manufacturing process has the capability to manufacture water transmission pipe in diameters ranging from inches to inches with wall thickness of inches to inch 
we also have the ability to manufacture even larger and heavier pipe with other processes 
we can coat and or line these products with cement mortar  polyethylene tape  polyurethane paints  epoxies  pritec  and coal tar enamel according to our customers specifications 
we maintain fabrication facilities that provide installation contractors with custom fabricated sections as well as straight pipe sections 
we typically deliver a complete pipeline system to the installation contractor 

table of contents tubular products 
our tubular products range in size from inches to inches in diameter with wall thickness from inches to inches 
these products are typically sold to distributors or original equipment manufacturers oems and are used for a wide variety of applications  including energy  construction  agriculture and traffic signpost systems 
marketing water transmission 
the primary customers for water transmission products are installation contractors for projects funded by public water agencies 
our plant locations in oregon  colorado  california  west virginia  texas  utah and mexico allow us to efficiently serve customers throughout the united states  as well as canada and mexico 
our water transmission marketing strategy emphasizes early identification of potential water projects  promotion of specifications consistent with our capabilities and close contact with the project designers and owners throughout the design phase 
our in house sales force is comprised of sales representatives  engineers and support personnel who work closely with public water agencies  contractors and engineering firms  often years in advance of projects being bid 
this allows us to identify and evaluate planned projects at early stages and participate in the engineering and design process and ultimately promote the advantages of our systems 
after an agency completes a design  they publicize the upcoming bid for a water transmission project 
we then obtain detailed plans and develop our estimate for the pipe portion of the project 
we typically bid to installation contractors who include our bid in their proposals to public water agencies 
a public water agency generally awards the entire project to the contractor with the lowest responsive bid 
tubular products 
our tubular products are marketed through a network of direct sales force personnel  sales agents  and independent distributors in the united states and canada 
our tubular product facilities are located in kansas  texas  and louisiana 
our marketing strategy focuses on quality  customer service and customer relationships 
for example  we are willing to sell in small lot sizes and are able to provide mixed truckloads of finished products to our customers 
our tubular products are primarily sold to distributors  although to a lesser extent we also sell to oems 
our sales effort emphasizes regular personal contact with current and potential customers 
we supplement this effort with targeted advertising and brochures and participation in trade shows 
manufacturing water transmission 
water transmission manufacturing begins with the preparation of engineered drawings of each unique piece of pipe in a project 
these drawings are prepared on our proprietary computer aided design system and are used as blueprints for the manufacture of the pipe 
after the drawings are completed and approved  manufacturing begins by feeding steel coil continuously at a specified angle into a spiral weld mill which cold forms the band into a tubular configuration with a spiral seam 
automated arc welders  positioned on both the inside and the outside of the tube  are used to weld the seam 
the welded tube is then cut at the specified length 
after completion of the forming and welding phases  the finished cylinder is tested and inspected in accordance with project specifications  which may include radiographic analysis of the weld seam 
the cylinders are then coated and lined as specified 
possible coatings include coal tar enamel  polyethylene tape  polyurethane paint  epoxies  pritec and cement mortar 
linings may be cement mortar  polyurethane or epoxies 
following coating and lining  certain pieces may be custom fabricated as required for the project 
this process is performed in our fabrication facilities 
upon final inspection  the pipe is prepared for shipment 
we ship our products to project sites principally by truck and rail 
tubular products 
tubular products are manufactured by an erw process in diameters ranging from inches to inches 
this process begins by unrolling and slitting steel coils into narrower bands sized to the circumference of the finished product 
each band is re coiled and fed into the material handling equipment at the front end of the erw mill and fed through a series of rolls that cold form it into a tubular configuration 
the resultant tube is welded by high frequency electric resistance welders 
some products are reconfigured into rectangular and square shapes and then cut into the appropriate lengths 
after exiting the mill  the products are straightened  inspected  tested and end finished 
certain products are coated 

table of contents technology 
advances in technology help us produce high quality products at competitive prices 
we continue to invest in technological improvements  which include the addition of a state of the art edge milling machine to prepare steel edges for optimum welding quality and speed 
to stay current with technological developments in the united states and abroad  we participate in trade shows  industry associations  research projects and vendor trials of new products 
quality assurance 
we have quality management systems in place that assure we consistently provide products that meet or exceed customer and applicable regulatory requirements 
the quality assurance department reports directly to the chief executive officer 
all of our quality management systems in the united states are registered by the international organization for standardization  or iso  under a multi site registration 
in addition to iso qualification  the american institute of steel construction  american petroleum institute  american society for mechanical engineers  factory mutual  national sanitation foundation  and underwriters laboratory have certified us for specific products or operations 
the quality assurance department is responsible for monitoring and measuring characteristics of the product 
inspection capabilities include  but are not limited to  visual  dimensional  liquid penetrant  magnetic particle  hydrostatic  ultrasonic  phased array ultrasonics  real time imaging enhancement  real time radioscopic  base material tensile  yield and elongation  sand sieve analysis  coal tar penetration  concrete compression  lining and coating dry film thickness  adhesion  absorption  guided bend  charpy impact  hardness  metallurgical examinations  chemical analysis  spectrographic analysis and finished product final inspection 
product is not released for shipment to our customers until there is verification that all product requirements have been met 
product liability 
the manufacturing and use of our products involves a variety of risks 
certain losses may result  or be alleged to result  from defects in our products  thereby subjecting us to claims for damages  including consequential damages 
we warrant our products to be free of certain defects for one year 
we maintain insurance coverage against potential product liability claims in the amount of million  which we believe to be adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that product liability claims exceeding our insurance coverage will not be experienced in the future or that we will be able to maintain such insurance with adequate coverage 
backlog our backlog includes confirmed orders  including the balance of projects in process  and projects for which we have been notified that we are the successful bidder even though a binding agreement has not been executed 
projects for which a binding contract has not been executed could be cancelled 
binding orders received by us may be subject to cancellation or postponement  however  cancellation would generally obligate the customer to pay the costs incurred by us 
as of december   our backlog of orders was approximately million 
our water transmission segment accounted for approximately of the total backlog of orders  and included backlog from one project of million 
binding contracts had been executed for this backlog as of september  backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual operating results for any fiscal period 
there can be no assurance that any amount of backlog ultimately will be realized 
competition water transmission 
we have several regional competitors in the water transmission business 
most water transmission projects are competitively bid and price competition is vigorous 
price competition may reduce the gross margin on sales  which may adversely affect overall profitability 
other competitive factors include timely delivery  ability to meet customized specifications and high freight costs which may limit the ability of manufacturers located in other market areas to compete with us 
with water transmission manufacturing facilities in oregon  colorado  california  west virginia  texas  utah and mexico  we believe we can more effectively compete throughout the united states  canada and mexico 
our primary competitor in the water transmission business in the western united states and southwestern canada is ameron international  inc east of 
table of contents the rocky mountains  our primary competition includes american cast iron pipe company and mueller water products  both of which manufacture ductile iron pipe  american spiral weld pipe company  which manufactures spiral welded steel pipe  and hanson pipe precast  which manufactures concrete pressure pipe and spiral welded steel pipe 
no assurance can be given that other new or existing competitors will not establish new facilities or expand capacity within our market areas 
new or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to capture market share and maintain product pricing 
tubular products 
the market for tubular products is highly fragmented and diversified with over manufacturers in the united states and a number of foreign based manufacturers that export such pipe into the united states 
manufacturers compete with one another primarily on the basis of price  quality  established business relationships  customer service and delivery 
in some of the sectors within the tubular products industry  competition may be less vigorous due to the existence of a relatively small number of companies with the capabilities to manufacture certain products 
in particular  we operate in a variety of different markets that require pipe with lighter wall thickness in relation to diameter than many of our competitors can manufacture 
in our markets  we typically compete with lindsay corporation  valmont industries  inc  tex tube  tmk ipsco  tenaris  us steel  allied tube and conduit corp 
and john maneely company  as well as foreign competitors 
additionally  several companies have announced new plants or the expansion of product lines at existing facilities 
new or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse affect on our ability to capture market share and maintain product pricing 
raw materials and supplies we purchase hot rolled and galvanized steel coil from both domestic and foreign steel mills 
domestic suppliers include arcelormittal  ssab  new process steel  nucor corporation  gallatin steel company  california steel industries  steel dynamics  inc  severstal  us steel corporation and nlmk indiana 
foreign suppliers include bluescope steel and ternium 
we order steel according to our business forecasts for our tubular products business 
steel for the water transmission business is normally purchased only after a project has been awarded to us 
from time to time  we may purchase additional steel when it is available at favorable prices 
purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales 
the steel industry is highly cyclical in nature and steel prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  availability of raw materials  energy costs  import duties  other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates 
we also rely on certain suppliers of coating materials  lining materials and certain custom fabricated items 
we have at least two suppliers for most of our raw materials 
we believe our relationships with our suppliers are positive and have no indication that we will experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or that we will be forced to seek alternative sources of supply 
any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental and occupational safety and health regulation we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations  violation of which could lead to fines  penalties  other civil sanctions or criminal sanctions 
these environmental laws and regulations govern emissions to air  discharges to water including storm water  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
we are also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties we presently own or operate and at third party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arrange to send hazardous waste 
for example  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at the portland 
table of contents harbor site discussed under legal proceedings below 
we believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not currently believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
based on our assessment of potential liability  we have no reserves for environmental investigations and cleanup 
however  estimating liabilities for environmental investigations and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control which may change dramatically 
accordingly  although we believe maintaining no reserve is appropriate based on current information  we cannot assure you that our future environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not result in a material expense 
we operate under numerous governmental permits and licenses relating to air emissions  storm water run off and other environmental matters 
in september and october of  we received several notices of violation and notices to comply from the mohave desert air quality management district district for violations of permitted particulate matter emissions limits and other violations at our adelanto  california facility 
we are negotiating with the district to settle these matters 
we do not believe that resolution of these matters will result in material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees 
approximately were salaried and approximately were employed on an hourly basis 
a union represents all of the hourly employees at our monterrey  mexico facility

risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors  together with all the other information included in this form k  in evaluating our company and our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected  and the value of our stock could decline 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
as such  you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 

table of contents risks related to the state of our internal control over financial reporting  the restatement of our financial statements and our failure to timely file periodic reports with the sec 
matters relating to or arising from our audit committee investigation of certain accounting matters  including regulatory proceedings  litigation matters and potential additional expenses  may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we recently concluded an investigation conducted by the audit committee of the board of directors with the assistance of independent professionals retained by the audit committee  the focus of which related to certain accounting matters  including certain revenue recognition practices 
in addition  at the direction of the audit committee  an external consulting firm was retained to assist in performing certain related analyses of our accounting practices and previously issued consolidated financial statements 
as previously disclosed  based upon its consideration of the issues identified in the audit committee investigation and the related accounting analyses  the audit committee concluded that certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements contained material errors and should be restated 
to date  we have incurred significant expenses related to legal  accounting  and other professional services in connection with the investigation  the restatement and related matters  and may continue to incur significant additional expenses with regard to these matters and our remediation efforts 
in addition  our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as well as senior members of our finance and accounting departments  have spent substantial amounts of time and effort with regard to the investigation and related accounting analyses  the restatement and related matters 
the significant amount of time and effort spent by our management team on these matters has diverted  and is expected to continue to divert  their attention from the operation of our business 
the expenses incurred  and expected to be incurred  on the investigation  the restatement and related matters  and the diversion of the attention of the management team which has occurred and is expected to continue  has  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our audit committee and management have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  and we may be unable to develop  implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods 
the sarbanes oxley act of and sec rules require that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures 
among other things  management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
based on our management s assessment  we believe that  as of december   our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective 
the specific material weaknesses are described in part ii item a  controls and procedures of this form k in management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected 
we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in additional material weaknesses  or could result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
these misstatements could result in a further restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
we have work remaining to remedy the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we are in the process of developing and implementing our remediation plan for the identified material weaknesses  and this work will continue during fiscal year and thereafter 
there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed  when it will be fully implemented and the aggregate cost of implementation 
until our remediation plan is fully implemented  we will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts 
if we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion  or at all  or if our remediation plan is inadequate  there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the sec and that our future financial statements could contain errors that will be 
table of contents undetected 
we will rely upon additional interim control procedures prescribed by management  including the use of manual mitigating control procedures and the utilization of external consultants  to fairly state our financial statements in all material respects 
however  the establishment of these interim controls does not provide the same degree of assurance as a company remediated control environment 
further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal controls could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and management s time to comply with applicable requirements 
for more information relating to our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  and the remediation plan undertaken by us  see part ii item a  controls and procedures of this form k 
our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the sec limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital 
we did not file this form k  nor the form q for the third quarter of and the first and second quarters of  within the timeframe required by the sec 
because we are not current in our reporting requirements with the sec  we are limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital 
our limited ability to access the public markets could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business 
until one year after the date we regain compliance with our sec reporting obligations  we will be ineligible to use shorter and less costly filings  such as form s  to register our securities for sale 
we may use form s to register a sale of our stock to raise capital or complete acquisitions  but doing so would likely increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 
outstanding comments from past sec staff review and any additional comments from future sec staff review may require that we amend our periodic reports filed with the sec  which could lead to significant changes in our past and current disclosure 
on july   we received correspondence from the staff of the sec relating to our form k for the fiscal year ended december  the form k and our definitive proxy statement filed on april  the proxy statement 
we have subsequently engaged in communications and correspondence with the sec staff  and as of the date of this filing  we have outstanding unresolved comments from the sec staff with respect to disclosure contained in our form k and proxy statement 
we have modified the disclosure in this form k in an effort to reflect all of the sec staff s prior comments 
we believe that the sec staff is waiting to resolve the outstanding comments until after we have filed this form k 
as a result  we may receive additional comments from the sec staff relating to our responses to the prior staff comments  new matters related to this form k or other periodic reports filed by us with the sec 
such comments may require that we amend or supplement  possibly significantly  the disclosures in this form k  including the restated consolidated financial statements included herein  or other periodic reports filed by us with the sec 
certain of our periodic reports filed with the sec are inaccurate and cannot be relied upon 
we have not amended and do not plan to amend our annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q that have been filed by us prior to the date of this form k 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should not be relied upon as described in our current report on form k filed on july  for the same reason  investors also should not rely on the unaudited financial results reported in current reports on form k prior to the date of this form k 
risks related to the pending sec investigation and pending litigation arising out of our restatement the sec s formal investigation and pending putative securities class action and derivative litigation have resulted in significant costs and expenses  have diverted resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as further described in part i item  legal proceedings of this form k  we were advised by the staff of the sec enforcement division that the sec has commenced a formal investigation 
as also further described in part i item  legal proceedings of this form k  several lawsuits  including two putative shareholder class 
table of contents action complaints that have since been consolidated into one action and one putative derivative complaint have been filed against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors arising out of our announcement of the audit committee investigation and related matters 
we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in responding to the sec investigation and in defending against the lawsuits 
we expect to continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs in responding to the sec investigation and in defending against these lawsuits 
if we do not prevail in one or more of these lawsuits  we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages 
further  if the sec were to conclude that enforcement action is appropriate  we could be required to pay large civil penalties and fines 
the sec also could impose other sanctions against us or certain of our current and former directors and officers 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
additionally  while we believe we have made appropriate judgments in determining the correct adjustments in preparing our restated consolidated financial statements  the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported these adjustments 
accordingly  there is a risk that we may have to further restate our historical consolidated financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec or take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  our board of directors  management and employees have expended a substantial amount of time on the sec investigation and pending litigation  diverting a significant amount of resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
under oregon law  our articles of incorporation and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party  we have an obligation to indemnify  or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify  certain of our current and former directors and officers with respect to current and future investigations and litigation  including the matters discussed in part i item  legal proceedings 
in connection with some of these pending matters  we are required to  or we have otherwise agreed to  advance  and have advanced  legal fees and related expenses to certain of our current and former directors and officers and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending 
certain of these obligations may not be covered matters under our directors and officers liability insurance  or there may be insufficient coverage available 
further  in the event the directors and officers are ultimately determined to not be entitled to indemnification  we may not be able to recover the amounts we previously advanced to them 
in addition  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with the pending sec investigation and litigation 
we cannot provide any assurances that pending claims  or claims yet to arise  will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies  that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims 
the insurers also may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters 
furthermore  the insurers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us for insured claims 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that claims will not arise that are in excess of the limits of our insurance or that are not covered by the terms of our insurance policy 
due to these coverage limitations  we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
continuing negative publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as a result of the ongoing sec investigation  shareholder and derivative litigation  nasdaq delisting proceedings  restatement of our financial statements and related matters  we have been the subject of negative publicity 
this negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and may harm our reputation and our relationships with current and future investors  lenders  customers  suppliers and employees 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents risks related to our financial condition our significant debt obligations and the restrictions under which we operate as a result of our debt obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have financed our operations through cash flows from operations  available borrowings and other financing arrangements 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt and capital lease obligations 
our debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes in the future  reduce the amount of funds available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  illiquid capital markets  and adverse industry conditions  limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition  place us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt  and with respect to our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates  cause us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on our future operating performance and cash flows  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions  prevailing interest rate levels and other financial  competitive and business factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our inability to make scheduled payments on our debt or any of the foregoing factors would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we will need to substantially increase working capital when market conditions and customer order levels improve 
as business conditions deteriorated in  we reduced working capital by million 
when market conditions and customer order levels improve we will have to increase our working capital substantially  as it will take several months for new orders to be translated into cash receipts
