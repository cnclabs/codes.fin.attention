item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this annual report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the information in item ia of part i of this report  entitled risk factors  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business we provide grading and authentication services to dealers and collectors of high value coins  trading cards  event tickets  autographs  memorabilia and stamps collectibles 
we believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles by enhancing their marketability  thereby  providing increased liquidity to the dealers  collectors and consumers that own  buy and sell them 
once we have authenticated and assigned a grade to a collectible  we encapsulate it in a tamper evident  clear plastic holder  or issue a certificate of authenticity  that i identifies the specific collectible  ii sets forth the quality grade we have assigned to it  and iii bears one of our brand names and logos pcgs for coins  psa for trading cards and event tickets  psa dna for autographs and memorabilia  and pse for stamps 
additionally  we warrant our certification of the authenticity and the quality grade that we assign to the coins  trading cards  currency and stamps bearing our brands 
we do not warrant the authenticity determinations we make with respect to autographs 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from other related services consisting of i the sale of advertising on our websites  ii the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications and on our website  iii the sale of membership subscriptions in our collectors club  which is designed principally to attract interest in high value collectibles among new collectors  iv the sale of subscriptions to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins and to our coinfacts website  which offers a comprehensive one stop source for historical us numismatic information and value added content  and v the collectibles trade show con ventions that we conduct 
we also generate revenues from sales of our collectibles inventory  which is comprised primarily of collectible coins that we have purchased under our coin grading warranty program  however  these sales activities are neither the focus of nor an integral part of our business 
discontinued operations during the period from fiscal through the latter part of fiscal  we were also engaged in the business of authenticating and grading diamonds and colored gemstones the jewelry businesses and currency 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the board of directors approved a plan to dispose of our currency grading and authentication business  which we sold in february  in march  our board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of our jewelry businesses in order to focus our financial and managerial resources  and expertise  on our collectible coin  trading card  autographs and memorabilia and stamp authentication and grading businesses our collectibles businesses 
pursuant to that plan  in march we discontinued and have disposed of substantially all the assets of the jewelry businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors decided that we cease internal development of the business or assets of the gemprint identification technologies  which we acquired in fiscal  and we plan to dispose of the gemprint assets 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the assets and related liabilities of these businesses and their related operating results were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and prior period financial statements have been restated on that same basis 
see selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements contained in item in part ii of this report 
additionally  as a result of our divestiture of our jewelry and currency authentication and grading businesses and their classification as discontinued operations  our collectibles authentication and grading businesses comprise our continuing operations  and the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on those businesses 
factors that can affect operating results and our financial position factors that can affect our revenues 
our revenues generated by our continuing operations are comprised of i fees generated by our authentication and grading of high value collectibles  and ii to a lesser extent  revenues from sales of collectibles club memberships  advertising on our websites and in printed publications and collectibles price guides  subscription based revenues primarily generated by our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for collectible coins that have been authenticated and graded collectively  certified  subscription fees earned by our coinfacts 
com website and fees earned from the management  operation and promotion of collectibles trade shows and conventions 
our revenues also include revenues from sales of products  which consist primarily of coins that we purchase under our warranty policy 
however  those revenues  which vary from period to period depending on the volume and dollar amounts of the coin warranty claims we receive  are not the focus and do not constitute an integral part of our business 
our authentication and grading fees accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in the fiscal year ended june  and approximately in each of the fiscal years ended june  and the amount of such revenues is affected by the volume of collectibles sales and purchase transactions by collectibles dealers and collectors  because our collectibles authentication and grading services generally facilitate sales and purchases of coins and other high value collectibles by providing dealers and collectors with a high level of assurance as to the authenticity and quality of the collectibles they seek to sell or buy 
consequently  dealers and collectors most often submit coins and other collectibles to us for authentication and grading at those times when they are in the market to sell or buy coins and other high value collectibles 
in addition  the level of our coin grading and authentication revenues are impacted by the level of modern coin submissions  which can be volatile  depending primarily on the timing by  and size of modern coin marketing programs by customers who specialize in sales of such coins 
ultimately  the amounts of our authentication and grading revenues are affected by i the volume and mix of authentication and grading submissions among coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and other collectibles on the other hand  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turnaround times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turnaround times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions  as vintage or classic collectibles are of significantly higher value and are more saleable b y dealers than modern coins and trading cards 
our revenues also are affected by the level of coin authentication and grading submissions we receive at collectibles trade shows where we provide on site authentication and grading services to show attendees  because they typically request higher priced same day turnaround for the coins they submit at those shows 
the level of trade show submissions will vary from period to period depending upon a number of factors  including the number and the timing of the shows  the volume of collectible coins bought or sold at those shows by dealers and collectors  and short term decisions made by dealers during shows 
in addition  the number of such submissions and  therefore  the revenues we generate from the authentication and grading of coins at trade shows can be impacted by short term changes in the price of gold that som etimes occur around the time of the shows  which can affect the volume of coin transactions that take place at the shows 
five of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted  in the aggregate  for approximately of our total net revenues in the fiscal year ended june  as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a significant decrease in the volume of grading submissions from any of them to us  would cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could adversely affect our results of operations 
the following table provides information regarding the respective number of coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that we graded or authenticated in the fiscal years ended june    and units processed coins trading cards autographs stamps total the following table sets forth the estimated values at which our customers insured the coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that they submitted to us for grading or authentication declared values s coins trading cards autographs stamps total factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins we earn on collectibles authentication and grading submissions are impacted by much the same factors that impact our revenues  as the average service fee and the resulting gross profit margin earned is affected by i the volume and mix of those submissions among coins  trading cards and other collectibles  because we generally realize higher margins on coin submissions than on submissions of other collectibles  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turnaround times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and tradin g cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turnaround times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions 
furthermore  because a significant proportion of our costs of sales are fixed in nature in the short term  our gross profit margin is also affected by the overall volume of collectibles that we authenticate and grade in any period 
impact of economic conditions on our financial performance 
the demand for our collectibles authentication and grading services and  therefore  our revenues  depend to a great extent on the volume of purchases and sales of the high value collectibles that we authenticate and grade  because dealers and collectors most often submit collectibles to us for authenticating and grading in anticipation of or in connection with their sales and purchases of those collectibles collectibles transactions 
the volume of collectibles transactions is  in turn  primarily affected by i the disposable income available to collectors and their confidence about future economic conditions  because high value collectibles are generally viewed as luxury goods an d are purchased with disposable income  ii the cash flows generated by collectibles dealers and their confidence about future economic conditions  which affect the willingness of such dealers to purchase collectibles for resale  iii the availability and cost of borrowings because collectibles dealers often rely on borrowings to fund their purchases of collectibles  iv prevailing and anticipated rates of inflation  because the threat of and actual increases in inflation often lead investors and consumers to purchase gold and silver coins as a hedge against inflation  and v the performance and volatility of the gold and other precious metals markets and the stock markets  which affects the level of purchases and sales of collectible coins  because investors and consumers will often increase their purchases of gold coins if they believe that the market prices of gold will increase or the prices of publicly traded securit ies will decline 
as a result  collectibles transactions and  therefore  the demand for our authentication and grading services  generally increase during periods characterized by economic growth  accessibility to lower cost borrowings  or increases in inflation or in gold prices 
by contrast  collectibles transactions and  therefore  the demand for our services generally decline during periods characterized by economic downturns or recessions  declines in consumer and business confidence  an absence of inflationary pressure  or declines in the market prices of gold 
however  these conditions can sometimes counteract each other as it is not uncommon  for example  for investors to shift funds from gold to stocks during periods of economic growth and consumer and business confidence 
despite the continued uncertainties created by the economic downturn and the relatively sluggish economic recovery  the number of coins graded and authenticated during fiscal increased by  as compared to the number authenticated and graded in fiscal we believe those increases  which were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of modern coins that we authenticated and graded  reflect the continued high price of gold and inflationary concerns among collectors and investors  as well as customer specific marketing initiatives 
as a result  coin authentication and grading and related revenues increased by approximately in fiscal  as compared to fiscal by contrast  in fiscal  the number of trading cards and autographs that we authenticated and graded declined by  and  as a result  grading and authentication revenues generated by that division  which is our second largest business  declined by approximately  as compared to the same periods of fiscal year factors that can affect our financial position 
a substantial number of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
as a result  historically  we have been able to rely on internally generated cash and have never incurred borrowings to fund our continuing operations 
we expect that internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations 
in addition to the day to day operating performance of our business  our overall financial position can also be affected by the company s capital raising or stock buyback activities  the dividend policy adopted by the board of directors from time to time  and the company s decisions to invest in and to fund the acquisition of new established businesses and or early stage businesses 
in july  the company used approximately million of available cash to purchase  shares of our common stock in a dutch auction tender offer  and in fiscal  the board of directors reinstated the payment of dividends such that we paid approximately million in dividends to stockholders in fiscal in addition  our financial position is impacted by the company s tax position in t hat the company may only be required to pay minimum taxes  when it has net operating losses available to offset current period taxable income and the investment policy adopted for its cash balances  as this will impact the level of interest income earned on those cash balances 
trends and challenges in and opportunities for our businesses in response to the economic recession and the credit crisis that adversely impacted the volume of authentication and grading submissions to us during fiscal  we implemented a cost reduction program to reduce our costs of revenue and our operating expenses to bring those costs and expenses more in line with our revenues and  thereby  increase our gross profits and operating income 
during fiscal  that program  combined with the increase in our coin authentication and grading revenues  enabled us to realize increased gross profit margins  operating income  income from continuing operations and cash flows from operations

the income tax benefit of million in fiscal reflects the release of valuation allowances at june  see critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes  deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal of  was primarily the result of the operating losses  impairment losses and losses we recognized on the closure and disposal of our former jewelry authentication and grading businesses and our currency grading business that we exited in fiscal the losses on the closure and disposal of our jewelry businesses included in fiscal  for ongoing lease commitments and other charges that we will have to pay under leases for office facilities  in new york city  that had been occupied by our jewelry businesses prior to our discontinuance of  and exit  from those businesses 
we have updated our estimated accruals for those leases in fiscal see critical accounting policies and estimates accrual for losses on facility leases 
these  as well as other factors affecting our operating results in the fiscal  are described in more detail below 
see results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts and notes receivable and inventories  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable or realize the value of our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates  and assumptions are based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those conditions  trends and circumstance s  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our judgments or estimates were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets  such as for example accounts and notes receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were made  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or conditions  such as increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for their full effects to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
in prior years  we acquired certain businesses and assets some of which are now classified as part of discontinued operations  as we have closed  or disposed of or are in the process of selling such assets and  in accordance with gaap  we accounted for those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
that accounting method required us to allocate amounts paid for those businesses in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  and to classify that excess as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we believe that goodwill has been impaired in the interim due to changing facts or events see goodwill below 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have defini te lives are subject to amortization over their remaining useful lives see long lived assets other than goodwill below 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to ongoing evaluation for impairment 
management formally evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the anniversary date of each of the business acquisitions that gave rise to the recording of such assets 
in the event it is determined  from any such impairment analysis  that the estimated fair value of any such assets has declined below their carrying values  it would become necessary for us to recognize an impairment charge that would have the effect of reducing our income in the period when that charge is recognized 
we also estimate losses associated with the disposal of a business or the sale of assets when a decision has been made to dispose of or discontinue such business 
in accordance with gaap  assets available for sale are stated at the lower of costs or their net realizable value 
in addition  the estimated fair value of liabilities for employee terminations is recognized as of the date such terminations are communicated to the affected employees and for lease obligations as of the date we cease using the real property or equipment subject to the lease 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for possible write downs in the carrying values of our assets 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and critical estimates that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we generally record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the customer 
due to the insignificant delay between the completion of our grading and authentication services and the shipment of the collectible or high value asset back to the customer  the time of shipment corresponds to the completion of our services 
many of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until the collectibles have been authenticated and graded and shipped back to them 
at that time  we record the revenues from the authent ication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the dealer 
a portion of our net revenues is comprised of subscription fees paid by customers for memberships in our collectors club 
those memberships entitle members to access our on line and printed publications and  sometimes also to vouchers for free grading services from us 
we record revenue for this multi element service arrangement by recognizing approximately of the subscription fee in the month following the membership purchase 
we review this estimate at least semi annually by recalculating the percentage based on the relative values of the various elements in the collectors club offering and determining the appropriate percentage to attribute to the grading services and the remaining subscription 
our estimates have proven to be consistently around on an ongoing basis 
the b alance of the membership fee is recognized as revenue over the life of the membership  which can range from one to two years 
with respect to our expos trade show business  we recognize revenue generated by the promotion  management and operation of each of its collectibles conventions or trade shows in the fiscal period in which the convention or show takes place  and for pcgs s coinfacts subscription revenues  we recognize revenue over the subscription period 
we recognize the revenue from the sale of a product when it is shipped to the customer and all the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
such products consist primarily of collectible coins that we purchase pursuant to our coin authentication and grading warranty program and those product sales are not considered an integral part of our ongoing revenue generating activities 
accrual for losses on facility leases 
as a result of the discontinuance of and our exit from the jewelry authentication and grading businesses in fiscal  we ceased the occupancy of facilities we had leased for their operations 
we retained a commercial real estate broker to sublease those facilities on our behalf 
through june   we established estimated loss accruals of  the amount of those lease accruals was determined based on estimates on a discounted basis of i prevailing sublease rates in the real estate market where those facilities are located  as compared to our rental obligations under those leases  ii the time we expected it would take to sublet those facilities  and iii other dir ect costs associated with the leases 
in fiscal  the company continued to re evaluate its loss accruals and recognized an additional accrual of  in the second quarter of fiscal in may  the company entered into agreements to reduce its lease obligations  whereby one of the spaces was sublet to a third party  and the second facility was returned to the landlord and the lease terminated with only a financial obligation remaining 
as a result of these agreements  and in accordance with gaap  the company measured the change in cash flows using the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to measure the initial liabilities and the cumulative effect of the change of approximately  resulting from the revision  was recognized as a reduction to the liability in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of those changes  the payment of lease obligations and the recognition of accretion expense  the remaining obligations at june  were approximately  we will continue to review and  if necessary  make adjustments to the accruals on a quarterly basis 
accounts receivable  notes receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our authentication and grading business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy dealers who submit collectibles to us for authentication and grading on an going basis 
until the second quarter of fiscal  we also made advances to selected coin dealers under notes receivable arrangements pursuant to a dealer financing program 
we regularly review our accounts and notes receivable  estimate the amounts of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts or notes in each quarterly period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due accoun ts  and in the case of customer notes receivable  the current value of the collateral we hold as security for the payment obligations under the notes receivable  and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors or note obligors to pay their accounts or notes receivable balances 
each quarter we review our estimates of uncollectible amounts and  if necessary  adjust the allowance to take account of changes in economic or other conditions or trends that we believe will have an adverse effect on the ability of any of the account debtors or note obligors to pay their accounts or notes in full 
since the allowance is increased by recording a charge against income that is reflected in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause an increase in such expenses 
inventory valuation reserves 
our collectibles inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for potential declines in the value of those inventories below their carrying values 
the amount of the allowance is determined and is periodically adjusted on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions or trends that may impact the sale value of the collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness and special features of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory and the volatility in the prices of precious metals  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than those that are required when determining the market values of more standardized products 
as a result  we review the market values of the collectibles in our inventory on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to the valuation reserve that we believe are necessary or prudent based on our judgments regarding these matters 
in the event that a collectible is sold for a price below its carrying value  we record a charge to operating income 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a limited warranty covering the coins  trading cards and stamps that we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if such a collectible that was previously authenticated and graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the collectible for a price equal to the value of collectible at its original grade  or  at our option  pay the difference between the value of the collectible at its original grade as compared with the value at its lower grade 
however  this warranty is voided if the collectible  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in whic h it was placed at the time we last graded the item or if we otherwise determine that the collectible had been altered after we had authenticated and graded it 
if we purchase an item under a warranty claim  we recognize the difference in the value of the item at its original grade and its re graded estimated value as a reduction in our warranty reserve 
we include the purchased item in our inventory at the estimated re graded value of the collectible  which will be lower than the price we paid to purchase the item 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
certain warranty claims were received by us in the second quarter and early in the third quarter of fiscal that were significant in relation to our historical claims experience and  as a result  in the second quarter of  we recognized an additional warranty expense of  in respect of those claims 
we also decided to increase our warranty accrual rate  effective january   to reflect this higher warranty claims experience  and we continue to monitor the adequacy of our warranty reserve on an ongoing basis 
there also are a number of factors that can cause the estimated values of the collectibles purchased under our warranty program to change over time and  as a result  we review the market values of those collectibles see inventory valuation reserves above 
however  once we have classified such items as inventory and they have been held in inventory beyond the end of the fiscal quarter in which we purchased them  we classify any gains or losses on the subsequent disposal of such items as part of the gain or loss on product sales and not as an adjustment to our warranty reserves 
long lived assets other than goodwill 
we regularly conduct reviews of property and equipment and other long lived assets other than goodwill  including certain identifiable intangibles  for possible impairment 
such reviews occur annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in full 
in order to determine if the value of a definite lived asset is impaired  we make an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition in order to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
as part of our jewelry discontinued operations  we recognized impairment losses on our identifiable tangible and intangible assets in those businesses totaling  in fiscal and  in fiscal  which have been classified as part of the loss on discontinued operations 
in addition  in fiscal  we reviewed the long lived assets of our continuing businesses and concluded that certain capitalized software used in our autograph business was not recoverable in full due to technical and operational inefficiency issues 
as a result  we recognized an impairment loss of  in our continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended june  goodwill 
we test the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of our continuing acquired businesses at least annually on their respective acquisition anniversary dates  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are determined to exist 
we apply a discounted cash flow model or an income approach in estimating the fair value of each of those businesses that we have determined constitutes a separate reporting unit  and we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its then carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists as of the measurement date 
if  instead  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less t han its carrying value  then there is the possibility of goodwill impairment and further testing and re measurement of goodwill is required 
in connection with our annual impairment test of expos in the first quarter of fiscal  we determined the fair value of the expos reporting unit using a discount rate of  and we concluded that the excess fair value of approximately over the carrying value of our expos reporting unit at september  was sufficient to conclude that no impairment existed at september  we considered the discount rates applied to expos to be reasonable based upon the recurring and predictable nature of the revenues for these businesses and consistent with the discount rates applied in previous years 
however  a higher discount rate of for expos could have resulted in the need for further testing and re measurement of goodwill and the possibility of an impairment expense 
with respect to our discontinued jewelry businesses  in the years ended june  and  we recognized impairment losses for their full carrying cost to the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of those businesses totaling  and  respectively  and these impairment losses have been classified as part of discontinued operations for the years ended june  and stock based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense using the black scholes option valuation method 
under that method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options or other stock awards that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
in addition  we recognize and report share based compensation expense  net of a forfeiture rate with respect to outstanding awards that we expect will occur over their respective vesting periods  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect the likelihood of forfeiture 
we monitor the forfeiture rate closely to ensure that all stock awards that vest are fully expensed over their respective vesting periods using the straight line attribution method 
no options were granted in and service based stock awards that are granted to members of our board of directors on an annual basis and to certain members of senior management are recognized as stock based compensation over the requisite service period 
fiscal restricted stock awards 
on june   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a management incentive compensation program for the fiscal year ending june  the stock incentive program  in lieu of a cash incentive program  for our three executive officers  michael j 
mcconnell  our ceo  david g 
hall  our president  and joseph j 
wallace  our cfo 
under the terms of that program  on july   these three officers were awarded the following numbers of restricted shares mr 
mcconnell  shares  mr 
hall  shares  and mr 
wallace  shares 
retention by the officers of their restricted shares is subject to satisfaction of certai n vesting requirements and  if a vesting requirement that applies to any of the shares is not satisfied  those shares may be forfeited and cancelled 
those vesting requirements of the stock incentive program were as follows performance based vesting requirement 
the vesting of seventy five of the restricted shares awarded to each of these officers the performance based shares was contingent on the company s achievement of a financial performance goal for fiscal if that goal was not achieved  all of those performance based shares would be forfeited and cancelled 
on the other hand  if the company achieved that fiscal financial performance goal  then i one third of the performance based shares of each officer would vest when it was determined that the performance goal was achieved  provided that the officer was still in the company s service at the end of fiscal  ii another one third of those shares would vest on june   provided the officer was still in the company s service at that time  and iii the final one third of those shares would vest on june   provided the officer was still in the company s service at that time  subject to acceleration of such vesting if an officer s service with the company is terminated without cause 
time based vesting requirement 
the vesting of the other of the restricted shares the time based shares awarded to each of messrs 
mcconnell and hall was contingent on their continued service with the company to july  in the case of mr 
wallace  of his restricted shares became vested on the date of the award 
management determined the fair value of the  shares of restricted stock to be an aggregate amount of  based on the july  closing price of the company s common stock of  of which  related to time based vesting and  relates to performance based vesting 
the company began recording stock based compensation expense for the time based vesting shares over the requisite service period through july  or immediately for those grants that vested on the grant date 
the company recognized stock based compensation expense when we determined that it was probable that the company would achieve the fiscal financial performance goal  which was the second quarter of fiscal and  as a result  we recognized approximately  of expense in fiscal year as s tock based compensation expense  with the balance of approximately  to be allocated to fiscal years and in august   it was definitively determined that the company had achieved the financial performance goal for fiscal capitalized software 
in fiscal years  and  we capitalized  for continuing operations  approximately   and  respectively  of software development costs related to a number of in house software development projects  in accordance with gaap 
gaap requires that certain software development costs incurred  either from internal or external sources  be capitalized as part of intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software  which we have estimated at three years 
on the other hand  planning  training  support and maintenance costs incurred either prior to or following the implementation phase of a software development project are recognized as expense in the periods in which they are incurred 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we recorded approximately   and  respectively  as amortization expense related to such capitalized software projects 
we evaluate the carrying values of capitalized software to determine if those values are impaired and  if necessary  we record an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that an impairment has occurred 
based on such an evaluation  we concluded that as of june  certain capitalized software used in our autograph and memorabilia authentication and grading business was not recoverable in full due to technical and operational inefficiency issues 
as a result  we rec ognized an impairment loss of  in our continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended june  see long lived assets other than goodwill above 
no impairment was recognized in or income taxes  deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
we account for income taxes in accordance with gaap  which requires the recording of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets or liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  gaap requires that we evaluate the probability of realizing the future income tax benefits comprising that asset based on a number of factors  which include projections of future taxable income and the nature of t he tax benefits and the respective expiration dates of tax credits and net operating losses 
in fiscal  due to the length of time and the extent of the taxable income required to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to impairment losses recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as certain california enterprise zone credits  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets totaling million at june  at that time we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize the tax benefits comprising the remaining million net deferred tax assets at june  in fiscal  due to the recognition of additional impairment losses in our jewelry businesses and uncertainties of our future financial performance arising from the economic recession and credit crisis  we did not recognize deferred tax assets for the losses related to the impairment and disposal of our discontinued businesses in fiscal  and we established a valuation allowance against our remaining deferred tax assets  such that  at june   we established valuation allowances of approximately million against the entirety of our deferred tax assets 
included in our deferred tax asset balances at june  were deferred tax assets of  related to compensation expense recorded in connection with the grant of non employee supplier stock options in those options expired unexercised during fiscal and  as a result  the amount of that deferred tax asset was ultimately written down to zero at june  that write down has been recognized as a  reduction to additional paid in capital at june  at june   due to i the improvement  that began in the second half of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal  in the operating performance and results of our continuing businesses  and ii management s expectations that such improved operating performance would continue in future periods  we concluded that it had become more likely than not  that we would be able to realize all of our remaining deferred tax assets 
as a result  the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were released at june  of this tax benefit of approximately million  approximately million was utilized to offset current year taxable income  and the balance of million was recognized as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations and as deferred tax assets at june  results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods indicated below fiscal year ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing expenses general administrative expenses impairment losses amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of loss on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes net income loss net revenues

fiscal vs 
for fiscal  net revenues increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was attributable to a  or  increase in grading and authentication fees and a small reduction in other related services related to product sales 
the increased grading and authentication fees for fiscal included increased coins grading and authentication fees of  or  partially offset by reductions of  or  in our trading cards and autographs businesses and  or  in stamps 
due to the strong performance of our coin grading and authentication business relative to our other businesses in fiscal  our coin business represented approximately of total revenues  compared to of total revenues in fiscal year  thereby  increasing the importance of our coin grading and authentication business to our overall financial performance 
the increase in coin grading and authentication fees of  for fiscal was due primarily to modern coin grading revenue increases of approximately  or  over the corresponding periods in fiscal also contributing to the coin increase in fiscal  was revenues from grading and authentication of coins at collectible trade shows which increased by approximately  or  over the prior fiscal year  due primarily to an increase in the number of shows attended in those periods 
revenues from the grading and authentication of vintage coins were substantially unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe the economic recession and credit crisis primarily led to the decrease in revenues from the authentication and grading of trading cards  autographs and stamps 
however  we did see a slower rate of decline in trading card and autograph authentication and grading revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when such revenues decreased by as compared to the fourth quarter of although the growth in the level of modern coin submissions provided substantially all of the additional revenues in fiscal revenues in  the level of modern coin revenues can be volatile due to specific customer activity or marketing programs in a given period 
we continue to see a strong performance in modern coin revenues although the increase in modern coin revenues decreased to in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to for the first nine months of the year 
in addition  having achieved a very strong growth in modern coin revenues in fiscal  it is uncertain what level of growth  if any  can be achieved in fiscal year fiscal vs 
in fiscal  our net revenues declined by  or  compared to fiscal that decline was attributable  primarily  to i a  or  decrease in authentication and grading fees  and ii a  or  decrease in the revenues generated by other related service businesses and our product sales 
excluding product sales  which we do not consider to be an integral part of our revenue generating activities  in fiscal  revenues generated by our other related service businesses would have been substantially the same as in fiscal and our total net revenues would have declined by  as compared to the total net revenues that we generated in fiscal the decrease in authentication and grading fees in fiscal was attributable to decreases in the fees generated by all of our authentication and grading businesses 
coin authentication and grading fees decreased by approximately  or  trading cards decreased by  or  and stamps decreased by approximately  or  respectively  in fiscal the decrease in coin authentication and grading fees was the result of i a million or decrease in the on site authentication and grading fees generated at coin trade shows  ii a million or decrease in modern coin grading fees  which were partially offset by iii a million or increase in the fees generated from the authentication and grading of vintage coins  the submissions of which increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our authentication and grading revenues were approximately the same as in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due primarily to a increase in coin authentication and grading fees  which more than offset decreases of and  respectively  in revenues from our authentication and grading of trading cards and autographs and stamps 
the increase in coin authentication and grading fees was attributable  primarily  to an increase of the grading and authentication of modern coins in the quarter  a trend that continued into fiscal see above 
gross profit gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
the costs of authentication and grading revenues consist primarily of labor to authenticate and grade collectibles  production costs  credit card fees  warranty expense  occupancy  security  and insurance costs that directly relate to providing authentication and grading services 
cost of revenues also includes printing  other direct costs of the revenues generated by our other related services businesses and the costs of product revenues  which represent the carrying value of the inventory of products primarily collectible coins that we sold 
in addition  costs of revenues include stock based compensation attributable to stock incentive aw ards granted to employees whose compensation is classified as part of the costs of authentication and grading revenues 
set forth below is information regarding our gross profits in the fiscal years ended june   and in thousands fiscal year ended june  gross profit gross profit margin fiscal vs 
as indicated in the above table  our gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal that increase primarily reflects i an increase of in fiscal in coin related revenues on which we earn a higher gross profit margin  ii lower direct costs  both in dollars and percentage terms  as a result of our cost reduction programs and operational efficiencies  and iii a reduction of  in stock based compensation expense in fiscal as a result of awards granted in periods prior to fiscal that became fully vested in fiscal in fiscal  our gross profit margin on a quarterly basis varied between and 
fiscal vs 
our total gross profit margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding  for both years  the effect of product sales revenues  which are not an integral part of our core revenues generating activities  and increased warranty costs of  in fiscal as a result of unexpected claims in significant dollar amounts that arose during that period  the gross profit margin for grading and authentication and other related services would have been for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the improvement in the gross profit margins was the result primarily of cost reduction programs  including headcount and publications direct costs reductions  implemented in our coin grading busines s in response to the decline in revenues in  compared to  partially offset by a lower gross margin on trading cards and autograph revenues 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the gross profit margin  excluding the effect of coin sales  increased to  compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of advertising and promotions costs  trade show expenses  customer service personnel costs  business development incentive compensation costs  depreciation and third party consulting costs in thousands fiscal year ended june  selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues fiscal vs 
the  increase in selling and marketing expenses in the fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to increased incentive compensation expenses due to the increase in coin authentication and grading submissions and higher costs incurred in connection with on site grading at trade shows due primarily to an increase in the number of trade shows at which we participated in fiscal fiscal vs 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses decreased by  and as a percentage of net revenues  notwithstanding the decrease in net revenues in fiscal that decrease was primarily attributable to the implementation of a cost savings program that included reductions in personnel  media costs and the expenses of providing on site grading services at collectibles trade shows  as well as a reduction in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  in the mix of trade shows at which we offered on site trading card and stamp authentication and grading services 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses are comprised primarily of compensation paid to general and administrative personnel  including executive management  finance and accounting personnel and information technology personnel  facilities management costs  depreciation  amortization and other miscellaneous expenses 
g a expenses also include stock based compensation costs  arising from the grant of stock awards to general and administrative personnel and outside directors 
the following table compares our g a expenses that we incurred in fiscal to the g a expenses we incurred in fiscal and in thousands fiscal year ended june  general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues vs 
g a expenses decreased by  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal that reduction was primarily attributable to staff reductions  cost savings measures  most of which were initially effectuated in the latter half of fiscal  a reduction of outside professional fees  and the absence  in fiscal year  of severance costs of approximately  recognized in connection with the departure of the company s former chief executive officer in fiscal in addition  the reduction in g a expenses were partially offset by increased non cash stock based compensation costs of  in fiscal  compared to the same periods of the prior year  primarily related to restricted stock grants to management see critical accounting policies and estimates stock based compensation 
fiscal vs 
the decrease in g a expenses of  in fiscal compared to fiscal  was due primarily to cost reduction measures implemented in fiscal to bring g a expenses more into line with revenues 
those measures  which included  among others  workforce reductions and reductions in professional fees  enabled us to keep g a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  at despite the decline in revenues in fiscal the reduction in g a expenses resulting from those costs reduction measures more than offset severance costs of approximately  recognized in fiscal in connection with the departure of the company s former chief executive officer 
also contributing to the d ecrease in g a expenses was a  decrease in stock based compensation expense in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to a reduction in the number of stock awards granted and an increase in forfeitures of outstanding stock awards during fiscal  in each case as compared to fiscal impairment losses fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands impairment losses as a percentage of net revenues the impairment loss in fiscal was attributable to a determination that  due to technical and operational inefficiencies  the carrying value of capitalized software developed for our autograph business was impaired at june  amortization of intangible assets fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues fy vs 
the decrease in amortization expenses in fiscal  compared to fiscal  of  reflects lower costs as prior year capitalized projects became fully amortized  and the impairment of one project in fiscal fy vs 
the increase in the amortization expense of  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to the amortization of capitalized software costs  for which amortization commences as development projects are completed 
in addition  we also incurred amortization costs in connection with the intangible assets that we had acquired in business acquisitions that were consummated during fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal capitalized software costs and acquired intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

there were no new options granted in fiscal when applicable  we calculate stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock options as of their respective grant dates using the black scholes option valuation model and various assumptions that are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and recognize such costs on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
a total of  of compensation expense related to unvested stock based compensation awards remained unrecognized as of june  and will be recognized as compensation expense as follows year ending june  total these amounts  which are non cash expenses  do not include the cost of any additional stock based compensation awards that may be granted in future periods nor  as mentioned above  any changes that might occur in the company s forfeiture percentage see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
interest income  net interest income is generated on cash balances that we have invested  primarily in highly liquid money market accounts and funds  short term bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper instruments and tax free funds 
such interest income does not include the interest that we generate on loans that we have made pursuant to our dealer financing program  which are included in net revenues 
the following table compares the interest income we earned in the fiscal years ended june   and in thousands fiscal year ended june  interest income  net percent of net revenue vs

the income tax provision recorded in fiscal reflects tax at the effective rate for fiscal and a valuation allowance for california enterprise zone tax credits  due to our determination that it had become more likely than not that we would be unable to recover  in full  the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal discontinued operations fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands loss from discontinued operations  net of losses on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year primarily reflects accretion expenses net of income taxes associated with the company s ongoing obligations for the spaces formerly occupied by our discontinued jewelry businesses

as a result  the company released approximately  of its loss accruals for these leases in the fourth quarter of see critical accounting policies and estimates accrual for losses on facility leases 
the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal  primarily reflects i losses of  that we recognized on the discontinuance and exit from our jewelry authentication and grading businesses in fiscal  ii impairment losses of  recognized at december  to the carrying values of long lived assets and goodwill of those jewelry businesses  and iii losses of  incurred from the ongoing operations of our discontinued businesses from july  through the date of their discontinuance  which was march  no income tax benefits were recognized in connection with the recognition of those losses in fiscal  due to uncertainty as to the realization of our deferred tax assets in future periods

the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all adjustments consisting of normal adjustments and accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent fiscal periods 
generally  the revenues generated by our collectibles grading and authentication businesses are lower during our second quarter  which ends on december  than in other quarterly periods  because collectibles commerce generally decreases during the holiday season 
our collectibles trade show business  which we acquired in july  has added to the variability in our quarter to quarter operating results  as its revenues vary based on the timing of the collectibles trade shows it conducts 
as a general matter  the revenues of this business are significantly higher in the first  third and fourth quarters of our fiscal years  compared to the second quarter  because the long beach collectibles shows the larger of the two trade shows that it conducts take place during the first  third and fourth quarters  while the smaller santa clara collectibles shows take place in the second and fourth quarters of the year

the decline in cash used in financing activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and  was primarily due to a decision by our board of directors to suspend the payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of shares in fiscal in order to preserve cash to fund the company s jewelry businesses and support our continuing operations in anticipation of the adverse impact of the economic recession and credit crisis on our cash flows in the second quarter of  the board of directors resumed the payment of cash dividends 
outstanding financial obligations continuing operations

as a result  we paid dividends totaling  in fiscal and  in fiscal  respectively 
on september   the board of directors determined that  due to adverse market and economic conditions  including the liquidity crisis in the united states  the prudent course of action would be  and the board of directors voted  to suspend the future payment of cash dividends in order to preserve the company s cash resources to support the continued implementation of the company s strategic plan and the growth of its business 
at the same time  the board of directors approved a one time stock dividend on the company s outstanding shares

in addition  because we expect that our continuing operations will generate positive cash flow in the future  we plan to consider other uses for our available cash that we believe will enhance stockholder value  which could include the resumption of cash dividend s or additional buybacks of shares 
although we have no current plans to do so  we also may seek borrowings and we may issue additional shares of our stock to finance the growth of our collectibles businesses 
however  due to the economic recession and the credit crisis in the united states  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such borrowings or generate additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all
