our discussion and analysis of earnings and related financial data are presented herein to assist investors in understanding the financial condition of our company at december  and  and the results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes of our company presented elsewhere herein 
historical per share data has been adjusted to reflect our may two for one stock split 
executive summary organizational structure our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of centerstate banks  inc the parent company  company  corporate  centerstate or csfl  and our four wholly owned subsidiary banks  and their wholly owned subsidiary  centerstate shared services css 
our subsidiary banks operate through locations in ten counties throughout central florida  providing traditional deposit and lending products and services to their commercial and retail customers 
css is a wholly owned subsidiary of our subsidiary banks  which provides item processing services  human resource services  credit analyst services and information technology services for these subsidiary banks 
through our subsidiary banks  we conduct commercial banking business consisting of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
our profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses  the provision for credit losses  and the effective tax rate 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services  and also includes commissions earned on bond sales  brokering single family home loans  sale of mutual funds  annuities and other non traditional and non insured investments 
non interest expense consists of compensation  employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  and other operating expenses 
we operate under a decentralized organizational structure 
each of our subsidiary banks is managed by its own bank president  who has the primary responsibility for the profitability and growth of the individual business unit 
each bank has its own charter  management team and board of directors  although most of the company s board directors are also board members of one or more of our subsidiary banks  and our chairman is either the chairman or at least a board member of all our subsidiary banks 
except for the largest and or riskier lending facilities  which require approval of a senior committee comprised of each subsidiary bank president and our ceo  each bank generally makes its own lending decisions 
although lending decisions are made at each bank  credit loan review is performed by parent company employees  who are independent of the loan origination 
table of contents process and of the individual banks 
this system of checks and balances has worked well for us in the past  and is clearly being tested in this current economy and real estate market 
at december   our four subsidiary banks are operating an aggregate of bank branch locations in ten counties in central florida as summarized in the table below subsidiary banks no 
of locations counties centerstate bank central florida  na central osceola  orange centerstate bank  na csb west pasco  hernando  citrus  sumter  lake centerstate bank of florida csb polk polk  marion valrico state bank vsb hillsborough correspondent banking division through our lead subsidiary bank in winter haven  florida  we have initiated a correspondent banking and bond sales division during the fourth quarter of this new business line was created by way of a management lift out 
we hired substantially all the employees of the royal bank of canada s rbc bond sales division  who were previously employees of alabama national bank alab prior to rbc s acquisition of alab 
we augmented this group during july when we hired approximately individuals who were prior employees of the failed silverton bank in atlanta  georgia 
the division operates out of leased facilities in birmingham  alabama and atlanta  georgia 
the business lines are primarily divided into three inter related revenue generating activities 
the first  and largest  revenue generator is commissions earned on fixed income security sales 
the second category includes correspondent bank deposits ie federal funds purchased  correspondent bank checking accounts  and loans to correspondent banks 
the third  and smallest revenue generating category  includes fees from safe keeping activities  bond accounting for correspondents  and asset liability consulting related activities 
the customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions primarily located in florida  georgia and alabama  but will also include several other southeastern states 
branching activities we closed three small branches during the first one was closed march  it had been operating since and had total deposits of approximately million 
we sold the real estate and transferred the deposit and loan accounts to the nearest existing office 
the other two were closed april  one operated from a leased facility since it opened in august it had less than million in deposits 
the other operated from a building owned by the company since it opened in october it had approximately million in deposits 
we have the facility listed for sale 
the deposit and loan accounts were transferred to other existing branches 
we did not open any new branches during however  we acquired four additional branches with million of deposits pursuant to a fdic assisted transaction on january  we purchased the deposits of the ocala national bank onb from the fdic for approximately million  a premium of approximately 
initially  we did not purchase any loans pursuant to this transaction  but subsequently we selected million of loans included in the onb loan portfolio  hand picked by our internal credit officers  which we purchased at par with no loss protection 
onb operated from four locations all within ocala  florida 
two were leased and two were owned 
we subsequently purchased one of the leased locations  have agreed to purchase the two owned locations  and have entered into a short term lease on the remaining leased location  while renovation is occurring at a new location which we have purchased  after which we will move the remaining leased facility to this new nearby location 

table of contents capital offering during the third quarter of this year we raised additional capital through a public stock offering 
we sold a total of  common shares at per share 
after investment banking fees and other expenses  the net increase to our common equity was approximately million 
at the time  this raise made us one of the strongest capitalized publicly traded bank in florida 
the purpose of the offering was partly defensive but primarily offensive in nature 
although our credit metrics compare favorably to our peers in florida  they were  and are  the worst we have ever seen compared to our own historical performance 
we are in the greatest recession since the great depression 
the real estate market is in crisis  especially in florida  and approximately of our loans are collateralized by real estate  primarily located in central florida 
part of this capital raise was to mitigate against the effects of a continued challenging real estate market 
sometimes the greatest opportunities can present themselves in a crisis 
during  banks failed and were closed by the fdic 
we believe that the number will be significantly larger in we also believe that many of these bank failures will be in florida  including those within or near our own market areas 
we see a generational opportunity to potentially acquire several of these failed banks pursuant to fdic assisted transactions including loss share arrangements 
raising this additional capital helps position ourselves to potentially take advantage of these future opportunities 
tarp issuance and subsequent repurchase on november   as part of the troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program  we issued and sold to the us department of the treasury the treasury  a  shares the preferred shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  having a liquidation preference of  per share  and b a ten year warrant the warrant to purchase up to  shares of our voting common stock  par value per share common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
for a detailed description of this program  what we agreed to do and what we received  refer to our form k filed on november   as well as our form s filed on december  and our b prospectus filed on january  in summary  we issued cumulative perpetual preferred stock along with a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of to the us department of treasury  in exchange for  cash  which we received on november  the program provides that if an issuer raises qualifying equity capital equal to  in the case of the company or more prior to december   half of the warrant  shares in the case of the company will be cancelled 
on september   we repurchased the preferred shares issued pursuant to tarp  as described above 
also  because we raised qualifying common equity during  as described previously  half of the  share warrant was cancelled  pursuant to the tarp agreement 
we purchased the remaining warrant for  shares from treasury for  on october  increase of authorized common shares on december   a special shareholders meeting was held at which our shareholders voted to increase the number of common shares authorized from  to  among the reasons for this increase in authorized shares was to allow for some flexibility in case a large fdic assisted transaction presented itself  which might require us to raise some incremental capital specific to the transaction  and we had to act quickly 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have 
table of contents established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
a standardized loan grading system is utilized at each of our subsidiary banks 
the grading system is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending 
loan officers of each bank assign a loan grade to their newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades 
throughout the lending relationship  the loan officer is responsible for periodic reviews  and if warranted he she will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and or analyses 
we use a loan grading system of through grade is excellent and grade is doubtful 
loans graded or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to that particular bank s board of directors 
the company s loan review officer  who is independent of the lending function and is not an employee of any subsidiary bank  periodically reviews each bank s loan portfolio and lending relationships 
he may disagree with a particular bank s grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan s based on his risk analysis 
as such  our lending process is decentralized  but our credit review process is centralized 
beginning in late  the company s ceo initiated a new program referred to as centercourt  whereby all of our bank presidents and their chief lending officers are gathered together in one room along with our ceo  cfo  coo and chief loan review officer 
each bank president and his chief lending officer present their prepared written report on the status of their bank s loan portfolio 
past due  non accrual  impaired  potentially impaired  and loans in process of foreclosure  as well as oreo issues are presented and discussed 
these meetings are generally held once per quarter 
the objectives include early and quick identification and resolutions of potential loan losses  as well as sharing information and ideas between banks 
the process also contributes to each bank s allowance for loan loss analysis assumptions and preparation 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance consists of two components 
the first component consists of amounts specifically reserved specific allowance for specific loans identified as impaired  as defined by fasb accounting standards codification no 
asc 
impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed upon 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principle and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve general allowance on all of the company s loans other than those identified as impaired 
we group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss factor for that category adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 
the aggregate of these two components results in our total allowance for loan losses 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has selected november as the date to perform the annual impairment test 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet 
other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions 
they are initially measure at the fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
goodwill and intangible assets are described further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  net income our net loss for the year ended december  was  or loss per share basic and diluted  compared to net income of  or earnings per share basic and diluted for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decrease in earnings compared to  was the increase in our loan loss provision  versus  and an increase in our other credit related expenses  versus  both of which were reflections of the continued deterioration of the real estate market in florida specifically and the overall economy in general 
these and other factors contributing to our net loss are discussed below 
net interest income margin net interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets  less interest expense 
net interest income increased  or to  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase was the result of a  increase in interest income plus a  decrease in interest expense

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses expense increased  to  during the year ending december  compared to  for the comparable period in our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is 
table of contents decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior loan charge offs 
therefore  the provision for loan losses income statement effect is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses balance sheet approach 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers  the historical loan loss experience  the general economic environment  the overall portfolio composition  and other information 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes 
see credit quality and allowance for loan losses regarding the allowance for loan losses for additional information 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the comparable period in this increase was the result of the following components listed in the table below amounts listed are in thousands of dollars

we did not renew the lease  and closed the office on march  we transferred all the loan and deposit accounts to one or more of our existing offices 
see executive summary for a discussion on our branching activity including this sale 
we initiated a correspondent banking division during the fourth quarter of the primary revenue generator of this new business unit is bond sales to correspondent banks 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized  of gross revenue from commissions on bond sales 
during we recognized  of gross revenue from commissions on bond sales 
see executive summary for further discussion relating to our new correspondent banking division 
we sold approximately  of securities available for sale during  generating a net gain on sale of  during the previous year we sold approximately  of securities available for sale generating a net gain on sale of  the sales were a result of liquidity management and asset liability management 
during the third quarter of we initiated a trading securities portfolio at our lead subsidiary bank 
realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue  a component of our non interest income  included in the list above 
securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal securities and are held for short periods of time 
during we purchased approximately  of 
table of contents securities for this portfolio and sold all of them before the end of the year recognizing a net gain on sale of approximately  at december   we did not own any securities in our trading portfolio 
this activity was initiated to take advantage of market opportunities  when presented  for short term revenue gains 
bank owned life insurance boli income is up year to year primarily due to the purchase of an additional  of boli early in many of the other normal recurring related revenue items listed above have increased year to year due to our internally generated growth as well as our purchase of additional customer relationships related to the ocala national bank transaction in january commissions from mortgage broker activities is dependent on market place forces including supply and demand of single family residential property in our local markets  and the interest rate environment which primarily effects refinancing activity 
sales of mutual funds and annuities are somewhat dependent on market place forces as well  but is also related to the successful efforts of our investment sales representatives 
these commissions will fluctuate period to period

table of contents overall  our non interest expenses increased significantly due to the growth in our business from the initiation of the correspondent banking business in birmingham  alabama november and in atlanta  georgia july 
see executive summary for a discussion relating to our new correspondent banking division 
we also acquired four ocala national bank offices from the fdic in january in addition to the added cost from growth  we also incurred substantially more credit related expenses this year compared to last year  due to the deterioration in real estate market 
we also incurred an impairment charge relating to a core deposit intangible 
significant line items listed above are discussed in more detail below 
our largest non interest expense is employee and employee related expenses 
total salaries  wages and employee benefits for accounted for of our total non interest expense  and for referring to the table above  employee salaries and wages increased by  or to  for  compared to  for the increase was primarily due to the correspondent banking division started in november the majority of employee salaries and wage expense from the correspondent banking division is related to commissions on bond sales  which is all variable based

the atlanta office did not open until july excluding the correspondent banking division  discussed above  total salaries and wage expense was  for compared to  for this increase was due to the increase in full time equivalent employees ftes  excluding correspondent banking division 
we closed three small branches during  but acquired four larger branch offices in january  which is the primary reason for the increase in ftes  along with our internal growth

year year employee salary and wages remove correspondent banking division salary and wages employee salary and wages  excluding correspondent banking division total average ftes remove correspondent banking division average ftes average ftes excluding correspondent banking division cost per average fte  excluding correspondent banking division we use a combination of performance incentive bonus guidelines to motivate our employees to perform 
these are primarily tied to earnings performance and growth metrics at each business unit 
as our net income increases and our assets grow  our employee incentive bonus compensation also increases 
in addition  we also have incentive compensation programs tied to growth of core deposits for certain employee classes responsible for these types of deposit customer relationships 
although we reported a net loss for on a consolidated basis  two of our banks were profitable 
in addition  our performance guidelines reward balance sheet growth as well  up to certain levels 
as a result  several business units qualified for an incentive award 
approximately of the  employee incentive bonus compensation recognized during relates to our largest subsidiary bank  which is also our most profitable 
the remaining was dispersed among most of the remaining business units and several of the senior corporate officers 
see our compensation discussion and analysis in our current years proxy statement for a discussion of executive compensation 
during our occupancy expense increased by  and our depreciation expense increased by  compared to this increase was due to the correspondent banking division which opened an office in birmingham in november and in atlanta in july in addition we acquired four larger bank branch offices in ocala in january and closed three small ones in april 
table of contents marketing expenses increased by  or year to year 
most of this increase relates to the checking account marketing campaign which had previously been in place at one of our banks 
that bank is continuing the program and our other three banks have started the program during various times in in addition to this program  the company is also investing in another marketing effort related to the internet 
data processing expenses increased by  during compared to this increase was primarily due to adding  converting and integrating our new correspondent banking division offices both in birmingham and in atlanta 
these offices  with their bloomberg terminals and other specialized it equipment requirements are significantly more expensive than our average commercial bank branch office 
however  in addition to converting these offices  we also converted four offices in ocala which we purchased from the fdic in january  after operating dual systems for almost four months during the conversion process 
the increase in the line item legal  accounting and other professional expenses was primarily due to monthly consulting fees paid relating to the correspondent banking business initiated during the fourth quarter of  consulting fees paid for services relating to managing foreclosure and repossessed properties  outsourcing fees related to certain internal audit functions  and increases in legal fees associated with various lease negotiations  new and potentially new business lines and various regulatory issues 
we recognized a core deposit impairment charge related to deposits acquired in our acquisition of the former mid florida bank  now part of our csna bank 
the transaction account balances have decayed faster than originally expected  and as such a write down in value was required 
we also recognized an impairment charge of  related to excess bank property held for sale 
this property was not acquired as a result of foreclosed loans  but was purchased by the bank for future expansion  and in one case relates to a single family home purchased by the company several years ago  at the then appraised value  as a result of moving one of our executive officers 
our intentions are to sell these parcels of land 
during the last quarter of  we obtained new appraisals and wrote the properties down to estimated market values based on these appraised values less estimated cost to sell 
bank regulatory expenses  including deposit insurance expense  increased by  or in compared to this increase was a result of increased deposit insurance premiums  which were a result of increased rates and growth in deposits  and a special assessment levied by the fdic of approximately  during the second quarter of in december  each of our banks were required to prepay a three year insurance premium  which in the aggregate is approximately  and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
loss from the sale of repossessed real estate  loss from the write down in valuation of repossessed real estate and losses from other repossessed assets as well as foreclosure related expenses as a group was  during compared to  during  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase is reflective of the deterioration in the real estate market in central florida and the economy in general 
income tax benefit provision we recognized an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of  an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax provision expense of  an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the reason our current year s effective tax rate was higher than our statutory tax rate is because we had substantial tax exempt income in excess of non deductible expenses thereby increasing our taxable loss substantially above our book loss as recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
the primary reason for the difference in effective tax rates between the two years is that we went from a relative 
table of contents small pre tax income amount in to a much larger pre tax loss in the table below demonstrates this difference 
year year loss income before provision for income taxes net tax exempt income taxable loss income statutory income tax rates income tax benefit provision effective tax rates comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  net income our net income for the year ended december  was  or per share basic and diluted  compared to  or per share basic and per share diluted for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decrease in net income compared to  was the increase in our loan loss provision  versus  which was a reflection of the continued deterioration of the real estate market in florida specifically and the overall economy in general  and secondly  the decrease in our net interest income  versus  which was caused by compression in our net interest margin nim 
these and other factors contributing to the decrease in our net income compared to are discussed below 
net interest income margin net interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets  less interest expense 
net interest income decreased  or to  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the decrease was the result of a  decrease in interest income less a  decrease in interest expense

table of contents we acquired vsb on april   and  as such  we recognized nine months of non interest income generated by vsb in compared to twelve months in the difference between the two years related to the three months equates to approximately  we initiated a correspondent banking division during the fourth quarter of the primary revenue generator of this new business unit is bond sales to correspondent banks 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized  of gross revenue from commissions on bond sales 
see executive summary for further discussion relating to our new correspondent banking division 
we sold approximately  of securities available for sale during  generating a net gain on sale of  the sales were a result of liquidity management and asset liability management 
commissions from mortgage broker activities is dependent on market place forces including supply and demand of single family residential property in our local markets  and the interest rate environment which primarily effects refinancing activity 
as the residential real estate market in florida deteriorated  activity decreased  resulting in decreased commissions earned in compared to sales of mutual funds and annuities are somewhat dependent on market place forces  but primarily dependent on the successful efforts of our investment sales representatives 
these commissions will fluctuate period to period

the most significant expense related to this new division was compensation related expenses during november and december of these will be included in our compensation analysis below

total salaries  wages and employee benefits for accounted for of our total non interest expense  compared to for looking at the table above  employee salaries and wages increased by  or to  for 
table of contents  compared to  for the increase was due to a increase in average ftes full time equivalent employees year to year versus  which was a result of twelve months of vsb in versus nine months in  as well as adding some additional employees late in the year relating to our correspondent banking division  in addition to three of our newest branches were not opened for the entire year in  but were in  and an increase in our average salary expense per fte year to year  versus  which was due to adding higher compensated employees to our employee mix  as well as normal salary increases 
we use a combination of performance incentive bonus guidelines to motivate our employees to perform 
these are primarily all tied to earnings performance and growth metrics 
as our net income increases and our assets grow  our employee incentive bonus compensation also increases 
in addition  we also have incentive compensation programs tied to growth of core deposits for certain employee classes responsible for these types of deposit customer relationships

in  we had more tax exempt interest income from tax exempt securities than last year  which is a decreasing effect on our effective tax rate 
we also had more bank owned life insurance boli income this year than last year  which is also tax exempt and also results in a decreasing effect on our effect tax rate 
in addition  we also had less stock option expense in relating to incentive stock options which are not tax deductible expenses  resulting in a decreasing effect on our effective tax rate 
because of our low taxable income this year compared to last year  our marginal federal tax was in compared to in the previous year 
lastly  in addition to having more tax exempt income in compared to in absolute terms  it resulted in a larger effect on our effective tax rate because we we re working off a significantly lower taxable income number 
income taxes are described and discussed further in note of our notes to our consolidated financial statements 
comparison of balance sheets at december  and december  overview our total assets grew by  or  from  at december  to  at december  the increase in our total assets was funded primarily by our growth in correspondent bank deposits federal funds purchased  our acquisition of deposits related to the fdic assisted transaction of a failed bank in ocala  florida  and our public stock offering this past summer 
securities we account for our investments at fair value and classify them as available for sale  except for trading securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of the effect of deferred income taxes 
if our management intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if our management does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the assessment of whether an otti decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
our available for sale portfolio totaled  at december  and  at december   or and  respectively  of total assets 
see the tables below for a summary of security type  maturity and average yield distributions 
we use our security portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and a base from which to pledge assets for repurchase agreements and public deposits 
when our liquidity position exceeds expected loan demand  other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative 
typically  we remain short term in our decision to invest in certain securities 
as these investments mature  they will be used to meet cash needs or will be reinvested to maintain a desired liquidity position 
we have designated all of our securities as available for sale  except our trading portfolio  to provide flexibility  in case an immediate need for liquidity arises 
we believe the composition of the portfolio offers flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity  without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels

this activity was initiated to take advantage of market opportunities  when presented  for short term revenue gains 
loans lending related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is a major contributor to profitability 
the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets  and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues 
the absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields

approximately of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  are commercial non real estate loans and the remaining are consumer non real estate loans 
the loans collateralized by real estate are further delineated as follows 
residential real estate loans these are single family home loans originated within our local market areas by employee loan officers 
we do not use loan brokers to originate loans for our own portfolio  nor do we acquire loans outside of our geographical markets 
the size of this portfolio is  representing approximately of our total loans 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  commercial real estate loans this is the largest category  of our loan portfolio representing approximately of total loans 
this category  along with commercial non real estate lending  is our primary business 
there is no significant concentration by type of property in this category but there is a geographical concentration such that the properties are all located in central florida 
the borrowers are a mix of professionals  doctors  lawyers  and other small business people 
approximately of these loans are owner occupied 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  construction  development and land loans we have no construction or development loans with national builders 
we do business with local builders and developers that have typically been long time customers 
this category represents approximately  of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of this amount  approximately  is land development  lots  and other land loans 
the remaining amount  approximately  represents vertical construction and the majority of that approximately is commercial construction 
within the total of this category  there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  of these non accrual loans  loans  are collateralized by residential building lots  commercial building lots  undeveloped land and vacant land both residential and commercial 
of the remaining three loans  there are two speculative single family home loans  and one which covers several properties including a warehouse and commercial buildings 
loan concentrations are considered to exist where there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities  which collectively could be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and when the total of such amounts would exceed of total capital 
due to the lack of diversified industry and the relative proximity of markets served  we have concentrations in geographic as well as in types of loans funded

the following table sets forth the loans maturing within specific intervals at december  loan maturity schedule dollars are in thousands december  months years over years total all loans other than construction  development  land real estate construction  development  land total fixed interest rate variable interest rate total the information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio 
see liquidity and market risk management for a discussion regarding the repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge offs 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 

table of contents the allowance consists of two components 
the first component consists of amounts reserved for impaired loans  as defined by asc impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed upon 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principle and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve on all of the company s loans other than those identified as impaired 
we group these loans into five general categories with similar characteristics as listed below residential real estate loans commercial real estate loans construction  development  land loans commercial loans not collateralized by real estate consumer and all other loans not collateralized by real estate within our five general categories  we also delineate further into sub categories where appropriate 
we then apply an adjusted loss factor to each group of loans to determine the total amount of this second component of our allowance for loan losses 
the adjusted loss factor for each category of loans is a derivative of our historical loss factor for that category  adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 
the environmental factors that we consider are listed below 
we consider changes in the levels of and trends in past due loans  non accrual loans and impaired loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans 
also  we consider changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
we consider levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries 
we consider changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans 
we consider changes in lending policies  procedures and practices  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses 
we also consider changes in the quality of our loan review system 
we consider changes in the experience  ability  and depth of our lending management and other relevant staff 
we consider changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments national and local economic trends and conditions 
we consider the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our existing portfolio industry conditions 
we consider the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations

we also observed a degradation of real estate values nationally in general  and within florida specifically 
we believe the changes in these trends differ significantly enough from historical trends such that we have increased our general allowance risk factors 
as shown in the table above  our allowance for loan losses alll as a percentage of total loans outstanding was at december  and at december  our alll increased by  during this twelve month period 
of this amount   relates to an increase in our component  or general allowance  which is due to changes in this component s risk factors  as discussed above  and the growth in the loan portfolio 
the remaining  increase is due to an increase in our component  or specific allowance 
this component is the result of specific allowance analyses prepared for each of our impaired loans 
we are committed to the early recognition of problems and to maintaining a sufficient allowance 
we believe our allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate

non performing assets consist of non performing loans plus a oreo ie real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  and b other repossessed assets that is not real estate 
we place loans on non accrual status when they are past due days and management believes the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when we place a loan on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent collections reduce the principal balance of the loan until the loan is returned to accrual status or interest is recognized only to extent received in cash

once the loan has been identified as impaired  a written analysis is performed to determine if there is a potential for a loss 
if it is probable that a loss may occur  a specific reserve for that particular loan is then recognized  and the loan is placed on non accrual status and included in non performing loans 
if the analysis indicates that a loss is not probable  then no specific reserve is recognized and if the loan is still accruing  it is not included in non performing loans 
loans that are monitored for impairment pursuant to asc generally include commercial  commercial real estate  land  acquisition development of land  and construction loans greater than  smaller homogeneous loans  such as single family first and second mortgages  consumer loans  and small business and commercial related loans are not generally subject to impairment monitoring pursuant to asc  but are analyzed for potential losses based on historical loss factors  current environmental factors and to some extent loan grading 
relationship between impaired loans and trouble debt restructure tdrs 
in this current real estate crisis that the nation in general and florida in particular has been experiencing  it has become more common to restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions 
in certain circumstances it may be more beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties  versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable and depressed real estate market 
when we have modified the terms of a loan  we usually reduce the monthly payment for generally about twelve months 
we have approximately  of tdrs 
of this amount  are performing pursuant to their modified terms  and  are not performing and have been placed on non accrual status and included in our non performing loans npls 
current accounting standards require tdrs to be included in our impaired loans  whether they are performing or not performing 
only non performing tdrs are included in our npls

we are continually analyzing our loan portfolio in an effort to recognize and resolve our problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
while we believe we use the best information available at the time to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses  we recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of our markets  and subsequent adjustments in the allowance may be necessary if future economic indications or other factors differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determination or if regulatory policies change 
we continuously focus our attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential problem loans  as they arise

liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
we measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments  lease obligations  and unexpected deposit outflows 
in this process  we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  at a given time interval  including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques we use in our asset liability management effort 
each of our banks  generally attempts to maintain a 
table of contents range  set by policy  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods 
each of our banks set their own range  approved by their board of directors 
if any of our banks fall outside their pre approved range  it requires board action and board approval  by that particular bank s board of directors 
the asset mix of our balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
our gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals

in the rate sensitivity analysis table  rate sensitive assets and liabilities are shown by repricing periods 
the estimated fair value of each instrument category is also shown in the table 
while these estimates of fair value are based on our judgment of the most appropriate factors  there is no assurance that  if we had to dispose of such instruments at december   the estimated fair values would necessarily have been achieved at that date  since market values may differ depending on various circumstances 
the estimated fair values at december   should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates

as stated earlier  the rate sensitivity table above summarizes our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods at a point in time 
it does not include assumptions about sensitivity to changes in various interest rates by asset or liability type  correlation between macro environment market rates and specific product types  lag periods  cash flows or other assumptions and projections 
however  in addition to static gap analysis  our banks also use simulation models to estimate the sensitivity of their net interest income to changes in interest rates 
simulation is a better technique than gap analysis because variables are changed for the various rate conditions 
each category s interest change is calculated as rates ramp up and down 
in addition  the repayment speeds and repricing speeds are changed 
rate shock is a method for stress testing the net interest margin over the next four quarters under several rate change levels 
these levels span in bps increments up and down from the current interest rates 
in order to simulate activity  maturing balances are replaced with the new balances at the new rate level  and repricing balances are adjusted to the new rate shock level 
the interest is recalculated for each level along with the new average yield 
net interest margin is then calculated and a margin risk profile is developed 
the results of these calculations  as of december  looking four quarters into the future  for our combined banks  are summarized in the table below 
change in interest rates bps bps bps bps bps bps bps resulting effect on net interest income a current a the percentage change in each of these boxes represents a percentage change from the net interest income dollars that the models projected for the next four quarters 
to put this in perspective  as an example  our net interest income for was  assuming a bps decrease in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would decrease by  or approximately  likewise  assuming a bps increase in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would increase by  or approximately  it is important to reiterate again  that these models are built on a multitude of assumptions and predictions 
this is not an exact science 
the benefit that we see is measuring our overall interest rate risk profile 
although we are by no means suggesting the exactness of the numbers above  what we see as a take away is that in general  it appears that if market interest rates increase  it would suggest a benefit to our net interest income 
if market interest rates decrease  it would suggest a negative effect on our net interest income 
we believe that our interest rate risk is manageable and under control as of december  simulation and rate shock stress testing our net interest income nim is a forward looking analysis 
that is  it estimates  based on various assumptions  what the effect on our nim might be given various changes in future interest rates 
another way of analyzing our interest rate risk profile is looking at history 
the table below measures the correlation between our nim and market interest rates over a ten year period starting at the beginning of and ending on december  we used prime as a surrogate for market interest rates 
this simple correlation is not perfect because we ignore changes in duration of our asset liability portfolio over time and changes in the slope of the yield curve over time  as well as other significant environmental changes that may occur  such as the banking crisis of and however  it will demonstrate that over time our asset liability portfolio generally tended to be asset sensitive 
that is  in general  over this historical period  when market interest rates increased  our nim increased  and when market interest rates decreased  our nim decreased 
in the table below  the prime rate is measured by the vertical bars  and their scale is on the left hand side of the graph 
each bar represents a month 
our nim is represented by the line graph and its scale is on the right hand side of the graph 
the line graph is connecting a series of dots  which represents our nim for a given quarter 

table of contents net interest margin vs 
prime logo managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process 
our philosophy is to not try to guess the market in either direction 
we do not want to be excessively assets sensitive or excessively liability sensitive 
we try to manage our asset liability portfolio with the goal of optimizing our yield without taking on excessive interest rate risk

the bank regulatory agencies have established risk based capital requirements for banks 
these guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank s capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories 
banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off balance sheet activities as loans sold with recourse  loan commitments  guarantees and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity such as preferred stock that may be included in capital 
each of our company s subsidiary banks objective is to maintain its current status as a well capitalized institution as that term is defined by its regulators 
under the terms of the guidelines  banks must meet minimum capital adequacy based upon both total assets and risk adjusted assets 
all banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of 
adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on our company 

table of contents selected consolidated capital ratios at december   and were as follows capital ratios dollars are in thousands actual well capitalized excess amount ratio amount ratio amount as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets effects of inflation and changing prices the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions increased cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings  and shareholders equity 
commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and can reduce our earnings from such activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic loss from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in a interest rates  b foreign exchange rates  or c other factors that relate to market volatility of the rate  index  or price underlying the financial instrument 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
each of our subsidiary banks has an asset liability committee alco which is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position  and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk for their specific bank 
substantially all of our interest rate risk exposure relates to the financial 
table of contents instrument activity of each of our subsidiary banks 
as such  the board of directors of each subsidiary bank is responsible to review and approve the policies and guidelines established by their bank s alco 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through gap analysis  which measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at specific points in time
