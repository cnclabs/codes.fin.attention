item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary quaker chemical corporation is a leading global provider of process chemicals  chemical specialties  services  and technical expertise to a wide range of industries including steel  automotive  mining  aerospace  tube and pipe  coatings and construction materials 
our products  technical solutions and chemical management services enhance our customers processes  improve their product quality and lower their costs 
the revenue decline in compared to was principally due to volume declines and  to a lesser extent  unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation 
volumes were down compared to and decreases occurred in all of the company s regions and market segments except asia pacific as the global economic downturn continued to impact the company 
this volume decline includes reduced chemical management services cms to the automotive industry both in terms of raw volume as well as reduced cms revenue reported on a gross basis 
the company did experience volume increases on a sequential quarterly basis throughout  however  volumes have not recovered to pre crisis levels 
the decline in product volume was offset in part by a significant increase in gross margin percentage as a result of cost reduction actions taken  a more favorable raw material cost environment and reduced automotive cms revenue reported on a gross basis 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a declined million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sg a was due to savings realized from the company s restructuring activities  reduced discretionary spending  lower commissions on reduced sales and foreign exchange rate translation  partially offset by the restoration of incentive compensation 
these sg a savings were critical in helping to offset the gross margin shortfall compared to the prior year 
the full year results included some unusual items 
a million restructuring charge was taken in  in a further effort to reduce operating costs as volume declines continued in the us and europe and extended to other regions 
the company also incurred charges related to the former ceo s supplemental retirement plan of approximately million 
other income for includes a million gain related to the disposition of excess land in europe 
the effective tax rate for reflects no tax expense being provided for the land sale gain due to the utilization of net operating losses which were previously not benefited and includes approximately million of benefit from the derecognition of various uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and resolution of tax audits for certain tax years 
the full year results included some unusual items as well 
a million restructuring charge was taken in response to the dramatic volume declines in the us and europe with the goal of reducing operating costs in those regions 
the results also included million of charges related to the retirement of the company s former chief executive officer 
other income for includes a net arbitration award of approximately million related to litigation with one of the former owners of the company s italian subsidiary 
the effective tax rate includes a million refund of taxes in china as a result of the company s increased investment and million of benefit from the derecognition of various uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and resolution of tax audits for certain tax years 
the net result was earnings per diluted share of  up compared to for  as well as a record million of cash flow generated from operations 
addtionally  a key driver in the company s sequential quarterly improvement in profitability throughout was the strong steel industry demand in china  brazil and india 
steel and automotive volumes  while gradually recovering  remain depressed in north america and europe and profitability  while improved  has not yet reached necessary longer term levels 
visibility of the future underlying business environment remains limited due to an uncertain global economic environment  as further discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
demand is expected to remain below historic levels 
in addition  although the raw material cost environment has been more favorable than a year ago  the company is closely monitoring the upward trend in crude oil prices as many of our products are made from derivatives of crude oil 
in  the company will continue its investments in brazil  russia and 
table of contents china as well as other key growth initiatives but still expects year over year earnings growth as volumes gradually increase 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  incentive compensation plans including equity based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulties 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis while a general reserve is established for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in 
table of contents accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concludes that it is probable it will be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it will record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with fasb s guidance regarding contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and was comprised of three investments totaling million in nippon quaker chemical  ltd 
japan at  million in tecniquimia mexicana sa de sa mexico at  and million in kelko quaker chemical  sa venezuela at  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
tax exposures  valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker applies the provisions of fasb s guidance regarding uncertain tax positions 
the guidance applies to all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the guidance prescribes a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon effective settlement 
the guidance further requires that the amount of interest expense and income to be recognized related to uncertain tax positions be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with the guidance  including timing differences  and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital needs and growth initiatives 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of foreign tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
the company applies fasb s guidance regarding exit or disposal cost obligations 
the guidance requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company records goodwill and intangible assets at fair value and amortizes intangible assets which do not have indefinite lives on a straight line basis over the 
table of contents lives of the intangible assets based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to their carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter  and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a weighted average cost of capital of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by more than percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the impairment analysis 
further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required 
the company s us pension plan year end is november  and the measurement date is december the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pre tax earnings due to changes in assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  percentage point increase percentage point decrease foreign domestic total foreign domestic total dollars in millions discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets recently issued accounting standards the fasb updated its guidance regarding a vendor s multiple deliverable arrangements in october the updated guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy to be followed in determining the selling price for each deliverable in multiple deliverable arrangements  eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement using the relative selling price method and requires enhanced disclosure regarding multiple deliverable arrangements 
the guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase resulted primarily from million of cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by million used in investing activities  and million used in financing activities 

table of contents net cash flows provided by operating activities were a record million in  compared to million in higher net income and improvements in working capital were the primary drivers for the increase in cash flow from operations compared to the improvements in inventory and accounts payable are reflective of the company s efforts to limit the pace of its investment in working capital in an uncertain global economic environment 
the timing of incentive compensation payments and expense is the largest other factor impacting accounts payable and accrued expenses  as no annual incentives were paid in for the year 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable that is reflective of the increase in volumes during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of as the company began to recover from the global economic downturn 
in addition  a significant amount of prepaid taxes was collected in europe during the second quarter of during  the company also incurred lower equity based compensation expense and higher pension payments as a result of the retirement of the company s former ceo 
the company s disposition of excess land in europe also impacted the cash flow comparisons 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million  compared to million in the decreased use of cash was primarily due to restricted proceeds received in from the company s bond offering related to the company s middletown  ohio manufacturing facility expansion project 
despite the global economic downturn in  the company continued to invest in two key strategic initiatives  the expansion of its middletown  ohio manufacturing facility and the upgrade of its global erp system  which comprises the majority of capital expenditures in payments related to acquisitions in include the final payment of million related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s brazilian joint venture and the final payment related to the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in its china joint venture for approximately million 
in addition  the company also received approximately million in cash related to the above mentioned sale of land in europe 
in the first quarter of  an inactive subsidiary of the company reached a settlement agreement and release with one of its insurance carriers for million 
the proceeds of the settlement are restricted and can only be used to pay claims and costs of defense associated with this subsidiary s asbestos litigation 
the payments are structured to be received over a four year period with annual installments of million  the first of which was received in the second quarter of  the second of which was received in the first quarter of and the third of which was received in the first quarter of the final installment is contingent upon whether or not federal asbestos legislation is adopted by the due date of such installment 
if federal asbestos legislation is so enacted  and requires the carrier to contribute into a trust or similar vehicle as a result of the policies issued to the subsidiary  the insurance carrier s obligation to make the final installments will be cancelled 
during the third quarter of  the same inactive subsidiary and one of its insurance carriers entered into a claim handling and funding agreement  under which the carrier will pay of the defense and indemnity costs incurred by or on behalf of the subsidiary in connection with asbestos bodily injury claims for a minimum of five years beginning july  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item of this report 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million  compared to cash provided by financing activities in of million 
the majority of the change was the result of net debt repayments in compared to net debt borrowings in  as well as a high level of cash received from stock option exercises in the record net cash flow from operations enabled the net debt repayments 
in  the company drew million on its ohio department of development low interest rate loan related to the company s expansion of its middletown  ohio manufacturing facility 
in  the company completed a million industrial revenue bond offering related to this expansion  the proceeds of which are restricted and can only be used for capital expenditures related to the expansion 
in the fourth quarter of  the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
the registration statement was declared effective on january  and permits the company to offer and sell from time to time in one or more public offerings up to million aggregate dollar amount of its securities  which may be shares of preferred stock either 
table of contents separately or represented by depositary shares  common stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase our debt or equity securities  as well as units that include any of these securities  on terms  in each case  established at the time of the offering 
while the company does not have the present intention to conduct an offering of securities registered pursuant to the registration statement at this time  the registration statement provides the company with the ability to issue registered debt or equity securities on an accelerated basis 
financial markets around the globe have experienced disruption  including  among other things  volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
further  concerns over slower economic activity  inflation and deflation  increased energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending could lead to adverse business conditions for the company 
although current economic conditions appear more stable  we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and global economic conditions 
reference is made to item a included in part i of this report 
while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit lines and finance our operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies 
the company s primary credit line is a syndicated multicurrency credit agreement with bank of america  na administrative agent and certain other major financial institutions  which expires in the maximum principal amount available for revolving credit borrowings is million 
at december  and  the company had approximately million and million outstanding on its credit facilities at a weighted average borrowing rate of and  respectively 
the company s access to this credit is largely dependent on its consolidated leverage ratio covenant  which cannot exceed to  except as noted below  at december   the consolidated leverage ratio was below to under this covenant  the company could have borrowed an additional million at december  as discussed in a current report on form k filed on february   the company amended its credit facility to provide covenant relief related to the and restructuring programs and the ceo transition costs 
in addition  the amendment temporarily increased the maximum permitted leverage ratio from to to for the quarters ended june  and september  and to to for the quarters ended december  and march  in february  the company also amended two industrial revenue bonds totaling million to provide for the same changes in terms as the credit facility 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt  with a combined notional value of million as of december  outstanding financial derivative instruments may expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any single counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
the economic concerns noted above can affect our business in a number of ways including  but not limited to  those addressed in the following discussion 
the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of customers to obtain financing 
the company believes demand for steel and automobiles have softened as a result of the reduced general level of economic activity 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
at december   the company s gross liability for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million 
the company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows 
table of contents by period related to its uncertain tax position liability 
however  should the entire liability be paid  the amount of the payment may be reduced by million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions 
the company s net debt to total capital ratio remained strong at and as of december  and  respectively 
the improvement in the company s net debt to total capital ratio was primarily due to record net cash flows from operations of million 
the company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements  including pension plan contributions  payments of dividends to shareholders  possible acquisitions and business opportunities  capital expenditures and possible resolution of contingencies  through internally generated funds supplemented with debt or equity as needed 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
the timing of payments related to other long term liabilities  which consist primarily of deferred compensation agreements  cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty 
interest obligations on the company s short and long term debt are included assuming the debt levels will be outstanding for the entire period and assuming the interest rates in effect at december  amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total and beyond short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions other long term liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements total contractual cash obligations operations cms discussion in  the company began to substantially increase the size and scope of its cms contracts 
the company currently has more than cms contracts in north america  as well as additional cms contracts in other areas of the world 
under its traditional cms approach  the company effectively acts as an agent  and the revenues and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
under certain of its cms contracts  the contracts are structured differently in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
profit is dependent on how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers to its own products 
as a result  under the alternative structure  the company recognizes in reported revenue the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions  which may result in a decrease in reported gross margin as a percentage of sales 
in  the company had a mix of contracts with both the traditional product pass through structure and fixed price contracts covering all services and products 
as a result of the global economic downturn and its 
table of contents impact in the automotive sector  during and early  the company has experienced a shift in customer requirements and business circumstances where the majority of cms contracts have reverted to the traditional product pass through structure 
however  the company s offerings will continue to include both approaches to cms 
comparison of with net sales for were million  a decline of million  or approximately  compared to million for volumes declined approximately  reflective of the global economic downturn 
changes in foreign exchange rates also decreased revenue by approximately 
gross margin decreased by million  or  compared to  reflective of the above noted volume declines which were tempered by gross margin percentage expansion 
the gross margin percentage increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to cost reduction actions taken  a more favorable raw material cost environment and reduced automotive chemical management services revenue reported on a gross basis 
sg a decreased million  or  compared to savings from cost reduction programs  lower travel and entertainment expenses and lower commissions  partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals  accounted for of the decline 
changes in foreign exchange rates accounted for the remainder 
in response to the global economic downturn  the company initiated restructuring programs and incurred charges of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share in  and million  or approximately per diluted share in the company completed both initiatives in the company incurred charges related to the former ceo s supplemental retirement plan of approximately million in  or approximately per diluted share  and expects to incur a final charge of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share  in the ceo transition costs incurred in were approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
other income for includes a million gain related to the disposition of excess land in europe  while other income for includes a net arbitration award of approximately million related to litigation with one of the former owners of the company s italian subsidiary 
lower foreign exchange rate losses in compared to also contributed to the change in other income in the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to lower interest income  as lower average debt balances were offset by higher interest rates 
the increase in equity in net income of associated companies and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to stronger financial performances from those affiliates as they began to recover from the global economic downturn 
the company s effective tax rate for was  compared to in the effective tax rate reflects no tax expense being provided for the land sale gain due to the utilization of net operating losses  which were previously not benefited  while the effective tax rate includes a tax refund of million related to the company s increased investment in china 
the company has experienced and expects to experience further volatility in its quarterly effective tax rates due to the varying timing of tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations as they relate to uncertain tax positions 
at the end of  the company had net us deferred tax assets totaling million  excluding deferred tax assets relating to additional minimum pension liabilities 
the company records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be a non cash charge to income in the period such determination was made  which could have a material adverse impact on the 
table of contents company s financial statements 
the continued volatility in the prices the company is required to pay for its raw materials  as well as the global economic downturn has been negatively impacting profitability in certain taxing jurisdictions 
the company continues to closely monitor this situation as it relates to its net deferred tax assets and the assessment of valuation allowances 
the company is continuing to evaluate alternatives that could positively impact taxable income in these jurisdictions

these forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us and our operations that are subject to change based on various important factors  some of which are beyond our control 
a major risk is that the company s demand is largely derived from the demand for its customers products  which subjects the company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer s business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns 
other major risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  and terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september   each of which is discussed in greater detail in item a of this report 
furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  and durable goods manufacturers 
these risks  uncertainties  and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors beyond those discussed in this report could also adversely affect us 
therefore  we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s debt is negotiated at market rates 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in borrowings under its credit facilities at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately libor plus a spread 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for the purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt 
the swaps had a combined notional value of million and a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december   the company is currently receiving a libor rate and paying an additional average fixed rate of approximately on its interest rate swaps 
five of the company s swaps mature in  with the remaining three swaps maturing in the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any single counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
see the information included under the caption derivatives in note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report and is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  the chinese renminbi and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 

table of contents in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location  as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  including some of our larger customers  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulty 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
