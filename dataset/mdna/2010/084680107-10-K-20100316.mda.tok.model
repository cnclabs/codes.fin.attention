item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 

table of contents critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the company s estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the financial statement date 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
although we believe that we use appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
conditions in the local economy and real estate values could require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
the allowance for loan losses discussion in item provides additional information about the allowance 
income taxes 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s asset and liabilities 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income  to which carry back refund claims could be made 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in determining the valuation allowance  the company uses historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
these underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management  the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
if the company is not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions and combinations 
these assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to income 
the fair value is based on observable market prices  when practicable 
other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable  including estimated discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
in the event of future changes in fair value  the company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
determination of other than temporary impairment of securities 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment otti on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management  the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
fair valuation of financial instruments 
the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
trading assets  securities available for sale  and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis  or to establish a loss allowance or write down based on the fair value of impaired assets 
further  the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value  the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value 
due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process  the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

investment securities 
total investment securities increased by million in due primarily to purchases of short duration government agency collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate bonds

at year end  all available for sale debt securities carried at least one investment grade rating by a major rating agency except for an investment in the mezzanine class b tranche of a million pooled trust security and a municipal bond 
the company evaluated the pooled trust security  with a level fair value of million and a carrying value of million  for potential other than temporary impairment at december  by performing a break even analysis with the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to calculate the excess subordination of the mezzanine class b tranche 
the company modeled actual cash flows from the pool s underlying securities as provided by intex solutions  inc and adjusted these for actual defaults and assumed defaults to determine the amount of future credit losses that could be absorbed by the pool s junior tranches before a single dollar of credit loss would be attributed to the mezzanine class b tranche 
the company s december  break even results indicated that there was excess subordination of approximately million above current and projected losses in the mezzanine class b tranche 
under this scenario  the pool would have to experience an additional million of future losses  beyond those projected in the analysis  before a single dollar of credit loss is allocable to the security 
the discounted  security specific cash flows indicated that the security s principal and interest was preserved 
this security is expected to continue to perform in accordance with its terms and its impairment was viewed as temporary by the company

loans 
total loans decreased by million to billion in primarily due to million in gross loan charge offs 
targeted growth in commercial loans and home equity lines mostly offset run off in residential mortgages and auto loans 
berkshire produced growth of million in commercial loans in  excluding net charge offs 
commercial loans grew at a double digit annualized pace in the second half of the year 
growth was lower in the first half of the year  as business loan demand softened in line with the sharp contraction in employment 
commercial loan growth included the benefit of the new commercial banking team recruited in new york in the second quarter of  and also reflected market share gains from national banks which were reported to have tightened their supply of credit to the region as a result of pressures on capital and liquidity arising from conditions in other regions 
at year end  the outstanding balance of commercial loan contracts written in was million  of which million was real estate related and million was commercial business loans 
commercial business loans increased by only million during the year due to the more rapid turnover of these loans and also because million of these loans were reclassified as commercial real estate related during the year 
most of the million net growth in commercial loans was in commercial real estate loans  although commercial construction loan outstandings declined by million reflecting the decline in qualifying construction loan projects as a result of the recession 
at year end  the ten largest commercial loan outstandings on loan contracts written in totaled million  including million to commercial rental real estate borrowers  million to educational institutions  million to an apartment borrower  million to ski resort borrowers  and million to a telecommunications borrower and a law office borrower

berkshire increased its share in its major markets  originating million in residential mortgages during the year 
most of this low fixed rate mortgage volume was sold to federal agencies  and as a result the company recorded runoff from its residential mortgage portfolio 
total residential mortgages decreased by million as a result of this runoff 
total residential mortgages sold were million in the company evaluated the bulk purchase of seasoned new england residential mortgages from banks in the region during but did not identify an appropriate purchase 
the company expects to continue to evaluate such packages to offset loan runoff and improve net interest income 
the portfolio of residential mortgages serviced for investors increased to million at year end  compared to million at the prior year end 
this servicing portfolio is a source of ongoing income and opportunity to build customer relationships  and it may increase in value if interest rates increase in the future as anticipated 
berkshire also produced a million increase in in home equity and other outstandings  including the benefit of pricing promotions in the first half of the year 
the balance of indirect auto loans continues to decline as the company allows this portfolio to runoff  reflecting the bank s strategic decision in to change its focus to lower risk  more relationship oriented consumer loan strategies 
the balance of total auto loans declined to million from million during the year 
berkshire offers back to back interest rate swaps to certain commercial loan customers  which allows the bank to book a variable rate loan while providing the customer an ability to fix its interest rate

the outstanding notional amount of interest rate swaps sold to commercial loan customers increased to million from million during 
table of contents total year end loans with repricings over five years decreased slightly to million in compared to million in the prior year 
the average yield on loans was in the fourth quarter of compared to in the same quarter of this reflected run off of higher fixed rate mortgage and indirect auto loans  and bookings of lower variable rate commercial and home equity loans

the bank benefited from more frequent use of interest rate floors  which in many situations established an initial rate higher than the contracted rate due to the current low rate environment 
problem and potential problem loans potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing  but where known credit weaknesses indicate the possibility of loss if the weaknesses are not corrected 
potential problem loans are typically commercial loans that are performing but are classified by the company s loan rating system as substandard 
the company s potential problem loans increased in from million at the beginning of the year to million at the end of the third quarter 
this increase included concentrations in loans for residential construction  lodging  and community nonprofit borrowers 
in many situations  the loans had been originated in the period and were made to long established area borrowers who borrowed to expand their operations and did not subsequently achieve the projected revenues 
total nonperforming loans increased from million to million over these first nine months  although many of these credits continued to make payments  often including support from guarantors 
due to the impact of the financial crisis  economic activity contracted sharply in the second half of and the first half of the third quarter of was the first quarter when conditions were stabilizing for a number of businesses 
additionally  many of the company s borrowers have seasonally strong summer cash flows and financial information is often updated in the fourth quarter based on seasonal and tax filing schedules 
as a result of these factors  in many cases  the fourth quarter represented the first opportunity for the company to be able to make a better assessment of the impact of events on the condition and prospects of commercial borrowers 
the company undertook a significant initiative in the fourth quarter to obtain updated historic and pro forma financial information on potential problem and other lower rated commercial loans 
additionally  updated opinions of value from third party appraisers or the secondary market were obtained for many credits  and they reflected recent trends of decreasing real estate values 
in performing its analyses  the company also utilized guidance that was provided to the industry by federal regulators in the fourth quarter about prudent commercial real estate loan workouts 
the company s net loan charge offs in exceeded its estimates of losses inherent in the portfolio at the beginning of the year 
these loan losses also reflected economic and market changes in that affected borrowers 
while overall loan payment performance remained within the expected range throughout the year  the company s initiative in the fourth quarter established that in a number of situations  borrower reserves were being depleted and collateral values were declining more than was previously apparent 
in order to reduce exposure to problems and potential problems  management took actions to reduce these exposures through loan modifications  loan sales  loan refinancings  and partial charge offs 
for a number of relationships  the company negotiated loan restructurings to reduce certain borrowers debt service  while maintaining a charged off component to preserve future recovery potential 
at the conclusion of the fourth quarter  potential problem commercial loans totaled million  compared to million at the start of the quarter and also down from million at the start of the year 
commercial loan net charge offs totaled million in the fourth quarter  measuring of commercial loans outstanding at the start of the quarter 
they were concentrated in relationships totaling million with charge offs totaling million 
many of these relationships were current in their loan payments but were at risk of becoming delinquent in the future due to economic conditions 
these relationships were spread among the company s regional markets  and included exposures in the sectors where the company had seen elevated stress  including residential construction  lodging  and community non profits 
the significant charge off rate among the above loans reflected the impact of lower cash flows and appraised values  and in many cases included the impact of restructured loans wherein the bank targeted to reduce the book balance to a conforming amount underwritten to provide debt service coverage of or more based on existing cash flows and loan to value ratios not to exceed 
the charge off rate also reflected the specialized real estate collateral in the stressed loan sectors  which in some cases limited the alternative uses for the collateral in the current depressed markets 
also  liquidity premiums for many property types have increased significantly due to the low volume of transactions in current markets 

table of contents at year end  commercial nonperforming loans totaled million  or of total assets 
many of these loans were continuing to make loan payments through year end 
the company had active workout plans on the majority of this balance  and specific reserves of million associated with these loans 
in a number of cases  the company s workout plans for these loans were established during the fourth quarter initiative discussed above  and there was insufficient time before year end to complete many of these resolutions 
total nonperforming assets measured million  or of total assets at year end this was increased from million  or of total assets  at the prior year end 
the company s nonperforming asset ratio at year end compared favorably to fdic statistics  with the national average measuring and the average for banks headquartered in the northeast region measuring 
the company s accruing loans delinquent days or more measured of total loans at year end  compared to at the prior year end 
performing troubled debt restructurings totaled million at year end  compared to million at the prior year end 
these loans included a number of loans which were modified in the fourth quarter to be conforming performing loans 
many of these loans are expected to be reclassified out of the troubled debt category in the first quarter of  based on their performance and risk adjusted market interest rates 
of note  foreclosed and repossessed assets totaled only million at year end  compared to million at the prior year end 
loan loss allowance 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate 
the company s methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in item i of this report 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses of million appropriate to cover probable losses which can be reasonably estimated and which are inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  actual future losses may be higher than this estimate and will depend on future economic and financial conditions and regulatory requirements 
at year end  there were significant challenges and uncertainties in the company s environment as described in the economic events section of item i 
the impact of these future events and events in the company s real estate markets is uncertain 
the company recorded net loan charge offs totaling million in the company had established a loan loss allowance totaling million as of the start of the year 
while the company had seen an adverse trend in its commercial loan risk ratings  loan performance in remained relatively strong and the company did not believe that inherent losses at year end were outside of the range contemplated by its current loan loss allowance methodology 
loan performance remained comparatively strong through  and the company s assessment of inherent losses did not change significantly through the third quarter of the year 
as previously discussed  the company undertook an initiative in the fourth quarter to obtain new information and reduce risk  and million in net loan charge offs were recorded in the fourth quarter 
at year end  the company s million allowance for loan losses included million in pool reserves and million in specific reserves for impaired loans 
this compared to a million allowance at the end of the third quarter  which included million in pool reserves and million in specific reserves for impaired loans 
the million increase in pool reserves in the fourth quarter included a new balance of million in pool reserves for million of commercial potential problem loans which were viewed as higher than normal risk 
additionally  residential mortgage and consumer loan pool reserve factors were increased in the fourth quarter 
while the company recognized that there were some factors suggesting a higher probability of loan loss which were observed in the third quarter  the company did not have sufficient information based on loan payment performance and loan losses among other factors which would have provided a basis for a higher estimate of inherent losses at that date 
including the additional information obtained in the fourth quarter  the company believes that it has recognized existing and identifiable loan losses and has provided reserves for its best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end the ratio of the loan loss allowance to total loans was at year end  compared to at the prior year end 
impaired loans with specific reserves totaled million  with million in specific reserves at year end of total loans  compared to a million total with million in specific reserves at the prior year end 
the increase in loans with specific reserves was related to the increase in nonaccruing loans 
the impaired loans with no valuation allowance included the troubled debt restructurings  which included a number of loans which were expected to be upgraded from this status after year end due to ongoing loan performance and their risk adjusted market interest rates 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets 
total goodwill and other intangible assets decreased to million at year end from million at the prior year end  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles 
the balance of goodwill was million at year end  of which million was attributable to the banking reporting unit 
the company evaluated goodwill for its two reporting units  banking and insurance  at year end as follows  banking reporting unit banking ru step the company calculated the implied fair value of the banking ru s equity by applying a combination of market and discounted cash flow valuation methodologies 
the market valuation approach was based on a comparison of the banking ru to publicly traded financial institutions identified as guideline companies on the basis of size  geography  and performance metrics 
the company conservatively calculated the first quartile multiple of the reference group s price to common book value  price to tangible book value and price to forward earnings estimates and multiplied these against the banking ru s december  common book value  tangible book value and forward earnings estimate  respectively  to arrive at three different minority basis values 
these values were then adjusted for a control premium assessed from recent market transactions  and weighted    and  respectively  to arrive at an imputed fair value of equity of the banking ru 
the cash flow valuation approach was based on the banking ru s cash flow projections through the projected earnings were adjusted to remove the effects of non cash charges from amortization  cost savings  and earnings retained for capital growth and the resulting cash flows were discounted based on a rate determined using the capital asset pricing model 
the market and discounted cash flow valuations were weighted and  respectively  and compared against the banking ru s carrying value as of december  these weights were deemed reasonable based on the expected relative importance for market participants in the current market environment 
based on this analysis  the implied fair value of the banking ru s equity was estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the unit thus failed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and the company proceeded with the second step 
step in performing the second step of the banking ru s impairment analysis  the company estimated the fair values of its net assets 
the company valued the banking ru s de novo core deposit intangible using a discounted cash flow approach 
deposits are considered core when they are stable and have a material benefit relative to alternative funding sources 
such deposits include checking  savings and money market accounts 
the value of the core deposits was principally based on the realization of cost savings between the cost of deposits and the cost of alternative funding 
the cost savings are defined as the difference between the cost of funds on deposits interest costs and net maintenance costs and the cost of an equal amount of funds from an alternative source having a similar term as the deposit base 
cash flows estimated over the life of the deposit base were adjusted for estimated deposit runoff and discounted using the capital assets pricing model 

table of contents as the oldest and largest reporting unit of the company  the company s trade name was wholly attributed to the banking ru 
the berkshire bank trade name represents a competitive advantage to the company due to its associated brand recognition and has value for a potential acquirer 
recognizing that an intangible asset may derive value from the avoidance of licensing costs for use of a similar asset  the company estimated the value of the trade name using the relief from royalty method while assuming that an acquirer would maintain the trade name for a period of years after an acquisition 
on the basis of the preceding analysis and the resulting fair value of assets and liabilities  the company estimated that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the banking ru was greater than its million carrying value 
the unit thus passed the second step of the goodwill impairment test and a goodwill impairment charge was not deemed necessary as of december  insurance reporting unit insurance ru step as with the banking ru  the company calculated the implied fair value of the insurance ru s equity by applying a combination of market and discounted cash flow valuation methodologies 
in applying the market approach to the insurance ru  seven publicly traded insurance brokers were identified as a reference group 
the company determined the median market capitalization to net income multiple and the median market value of invested capital to ebitda multiple for the reference group and conservatively adjusted these multiples to factor for the size differential between the guideline companies and the insurance ru 
the multiples calculated in this manner were multiplied by the insurance ru s net income and ebitda for the twelve months ended december  to arrive at two minority basis values 
these values were then adjusted for a control premium assessed from recent market transactions  and weighted  and  to arrive at an imputed fair value of equity of the insurance ru 
the cash flow valuation approach was based on the insurance ru s cash flow projections through the projected earnings were adjusted to remove the effects of non cash charges from amortization  cost savings  and earnings retained for capital growth and the resulting cash flows were discounted based on rate determined using the capital asset pricing model 
the market and discounted cash flow valuations were weighted and  respectively  and compared against the insurance ru s carrying value as of december  these weights were deemed reasonable based on the expected relative importance given by market participants in the current market environment 
based on this analysis  the implied fair value of the insurance ru s equity was estimated to be greater than its carrying value 
the unit thus passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test  and the company did not proceed with the second step 
cash surrender value of life insurance 
berkshire bank owns various life insurance policies which were written as part of the benefits program provided to certain officers in prior years  including policies relating to officers of acquired banks 
the cash surrender value of these policies did not change significantly during  and totaled million at year end 
the two largest insurance company exposures totaled million and million  and both of these companies were rated aa 
there were no material exposures to carriers below investment grade ratings at year end other assets 
other assets increased by million to million at year end primarily due to an million increase in prepaid insurance premiums and an million increase in the federal income tax receivable 
the fdic instituted a requirement in that insured institutions prepay estimated fdic insurance premiums through due to shortfalls in fdic funding as a result of increased bank failures 
the company does not earn interest on this prepaid balance 
the increase in the federal income tax receivable is due to the fourth quarter loss and the benefit of the carryback allowance against the million in income tax payments made over the prior three years 
at year end  the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes 
the total net deferred tax asset was million at year end and the company believes this asset will be realized based on future anticipated pre tax income 
the company recorded a million increase in limited partnership equity investments to million in  including solar energy and low income housing partnerships  and it had an additional million committed to fund these partnerships in 
table of contents deposits 
total deposits increased by million to billion in growth was concentrated in demand deposits million  and money market deposits million   reflecting berkshire s emphasis on relationship promotions 
as a result  total non maturity deposits increased by million  while total time deposits increased by million 
the growth in time deposits was due to growth in accounts with balances over thousand  which totaled million at year end  benefiting from the higher fdic insurance limits now available 
most of the deposit growth was concentrated in the first half of the year  totaling million during that period 
most of the first half growth was concentrated in the new york region  where deposits grew by million to million  benefiting from pricing promotions in that market 
new york deposits increased further to million at year end in this ten branch region which was created through de novo expansion in recent years 
first half deposit growth also benefited from pricing promotions and unsettled conditions that existed in financial markets during that time 
much of the year s deposit growth was in commercial non maturity deposits  which increased by million to million  or of total non maturity deposits 
retail non maturity deposits increased by million to million in new york retail non maturity deposits increased by million  offsetting a million retail decrease in other regions 
by emphasizing lower cost non maturity deposits and lowering time deposit costs  berkshire has reduced the cost of its deposits in order to offset the impact of lower asset yields in the current low interest rate environment 
the average annualized cost of deposits decreased to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of time accounts maturing over one year increased by to million from million during deposit growth was channeled into improved liquidity for the company  including higher investment securities and lower borrowings 
the ratio of loans deposits stood at at year end 
during the second quarter of  congress extended the thousand insurance limit on insured deposit accounts temporarily increased from thousand from december  to december  as a result of its membership in the massachusetts depositors insurance fund dif  the full amount of all of berkshire s deposits is insured through the combination of fdic and dif insurance 
in addition to the required fdic insurance  berkshire bank also opted in to the fdic s temporary unlimited insurance on transaction accounts  and has elected to maintain its participation in this program until its current expiry on june  the company also opted in to the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program  but no guaranteed debt was issued by the company under this program 
due to a rising rate of bank failures  the fdic has raised its regular insurance premium rates to banks  and additionally levied a special assessment in the second quarter which resulted in a million charge to the company 
fdic insurance expense measured annualized based on average deposits in the most recent quarter 
as previously discussed  the fdic has also required the prepayment of estimated insurance premiums through due to the uncertainties regarding the fdic s future insured losses and its funding requirements  there may be additional future changes in fdic insurance premiums and payment requirements 
bank failures are widely anticipated to increase  and the fdic s reserve levels are currently below targeted levels 
during the second quarter of  congress increased the fdic borrowing limit from the us treasury  providing the fdic with additional liquidity to manage bank failures and to pay claims on guaranteed bank debt 
borrowings and debentures 
total borrowings and debentures decreased by million to million during the liquidity provided by strong deposit growth was used in part to reduce borrowings 
due to the low interest rate environment  the company repaid certain long term fhlbb advances in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter  and recorded prepayment charges in those quarters related to these actions 
borrowings were shifted into low cost overnight fhlbb advances 
berkshire hills bancorp also prepaid a million term loan during the year and due to the cash liquidity from its common stock offering  it did not renew its short term line of credit in the fourth quarter 
at year end  berkshire had million in notional amounts of cash flow hedges of which million had been contracted prior to  which fix the rate on designated variable rate borrowings at a weighted average rate of

at year end  the company s swaps portfolio had gross unrealized losses of million which was improved from million at the prior year end 
the portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million and million at these year ends  respectively 
the net unrealized loss position reflects the unanticipated decline in market rates as a result of government interventions to respond to the economic crisis  and the improvement in resulted from improved market pricing spreads as market conditions moved towards normalization during the year

in the may million common stock offering  berkshire issued million shares including the underwriter s overallotment option  at a price of per share 
in the same month  berkshire repaid the full million balance of preferred stock owned by the us treasury 
due to this repayment  berkshire recorded a million deemed dividend which was charged against income available to common stockholders in the second quarter 
this one time deemed dividend had no impact on cash or on stockholders equity 
in june  berkshire repurchased the warrant for common shares which had been issued to the us treasury 
this million repurchase was a cash transaction that reduced stockholders equity but was not a charge against income available to common stockholders 
during the six month period in which the company was involved with the treasury capital purchase program  it paid a cash dividend at a annual rate on the outstanding preferred stock and paid the million warrant repurchase price 
accordingly  the total cash financing cost paid by the company while it utilized this financing was equivalent to approximately a after tax annualized rate on the funds utilized by the company 
this cost represented income to the us treasury for berkshire s involvement in the program 
berkshire fully complied with all terms of the capital purchase program during its participation 
in addition to the financing cost  the company paid higher taxes on executive compensation and complied with various program rules affecting its operations

the company s asset liability model had predicted a decrease in net interest income from in an unchanged rate environment 
us treasury rates remained fairly stable in  with near zero short term rates as a result of federal reserve stimulus policy and a positively sloped yield curve 
due to the company s asset sensitive interest rate profile  this environment created substantial pressure on margins as variable rate assets repriced and fixed rate assets refinanced 
while the company had anticipated that commercial loan growth would offset some of this pressure  the benefit of this growth was largely offset by the tightening of libor spreads and by the high level of mortgage refinancings and repricings 
other factors contributing to the decrease in net interest income included the planned runoff of higher yielding indirect auto loans  market floors on deposit pricing in the very low rate environment  and the elimination of the dividend by the fhlbb  which had contributed million in revenue in average earning assets increased by during  as deposit growth was channeled into investment securities with low market yields

level recurring measurements relate primarily to the million fair value of a local development bond issued to a berkshire county non profit  which is classified as a trading security 
additionally  a pooled trust preferred security and two limited partnership securities are valued on this basis 
non recurring fair values of financial instruments relate primarily to impairment analysis of economic development bonds recorded as held to maturity  restricted equity securities  and loans 
the only assets deemed impaired were million in loans  which were evaluated based on level inputs  which gave rise to a million impairment reserve at december  fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities primarily relate to impairment analyses of intangibles and goodwill 
the company performed an impairment analysis of its goodwill in the most recent quarter  and determined that there was no impairment as of december  the company also provides a summary of estimated fair values of financial instruments at each quarter end 
the category of financial assets with the most significant difference between carrying value and fair value is the net loan category 
the fair value of loans is estimated to be at a million discount to carrying value as of year end this is a change from a slight premium at the beginning of the year  and primarily reflects an increase in the amount of problem and potential problem loans  along with a decrease in the estimated fair values of these assets  and of loans in general due to higher market liquidity discounts in for financial liabilities  the total fair value of deposits and borrowings is estimated to be million higher than carrying value because of fixed rate obligations which are above current market rates 
the fair value of the company s million debenture has declined considerably to a million discount at year end due to the poor market conditions for privately issued unrated trust preferred securities 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of berkshire bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on berkshire bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary 
a sudden change in inflation or expectations about inflation  with a related change in interest rates  would have a significant impact on our operations 
impact of new accounting pronouncements please refer to the note on recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the bank seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
berkshire bank maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets monthly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the risk management committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
the bank has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 
berkshire bank also uses interest rate swaps in order to enhance its interest rate risk position and manage its balance sheet 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that would result from both an instantaneous or ramped change in market interest rates assuming a parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
the chart below shows the analysis of a ramped change 
the range of the ramp was shifted up at year end in the chart due to the very low interest rates prevailing at that date 
loans  deposits and borrowings were expected to reprice at the repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
no material changes have been made to the methodologies used in the model 
change in interest rates basis months months points rate ramp change change change change dollars in thousands at december  at december  during  the company maintained its moderately asset sensitive interest rate risk profile 
this reflects the company s general preference and also reflects management s expectations that inflation and interest rates will rise from recent low levels 
one factor contributing to this profile included the continued shift in consumer lending from fixed rate indirect auto loans to prime based home equity lines 
the bank entered into million in cash flow interest rate swaps in the past two years to fix the rate on adjustable rate federal home loan bank advances to match the rate duration on existing residential and commercial mortgage loans 
the company also entered into swaps to convert a million fixed rate economic development bond to variable rate and to fix the interest rate on the company s million in trust preferred debentures in additionally  the company continues to offer back to back interest rate swaps to certain commercial borrowers  and thereby was able to originate adjustable rate commercial loans which the customers swapped into fixed interest rates 
back to back interest rate swaps totaled million at december  and allowed the bank to fund these loans with short term deposits  including money market accounts which help the company grow its core transaction based customer deposit franchise 
due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  the above computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change 
the rate sensitivity depends on the underlying amount of market rate change and the type of deposit account 
the percentage rate movements are as follows now accounts ranging between and  money market accounts ranging between and  and savings accounts ranging between and 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material
