ebitda is a measure of operating performance that is not calculated in accordance with us gaap 
ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations  as determined in accordance with us gaap 
ebitda is a key measure of our operating performance used by management to focus on consolidated operating performance exclusive of income and expense that relate to the financing and capitalization of the business 
we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non gaap measure  is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results

overview we are a global company that acquires  leases  and sells high utility commercial jet aircraft to passenger and cargo airlines throughout the world 
high utility aircraft are generally modern  operationally efficient jets with a large operator base and long useful lives 
as of december   our aircraft portfolio consisted of aircraft that were leased to lessees located in countries  and managed through our offices in the united states  ireland and singapore 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
from time to time  we also make investments in other aviation assets  including debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft 
our revenues and income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  and for the fourth quarter were million and million  respectively 
revenues our revenues are comprised primarily of operating lease rentals on flight equipment held for lease 
in addition  we recognize revenue from lease termination payments and retained maintenance payments related to lease expirations 
we also earn interest income from our debt investments 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays lease rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease and the amount of the contracted rent will depend upon the type  age  specification and condition of the aircraft  and market conditions at the time the lease is committed 
the amount of rent we receive will depend on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies  restructurings and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry conditions and trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of depreciation of flight equipment held for lease  interest expense  selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  aircraft impairment charges and maintenance and other costs 
because our operating lease terms generally require the lessee to pay for operating  maintenance and insurance costs  our portion of maintenance and other costs relating to aircraft reflected in our statement of income has been nominal  however  to the extent our customers failed to pay operating  maintenance  insurance or transition costs  our portion of these expenses for unscheduled lease terminations reflected in our income statement has increased significantly as compared to prior years 
income tax provision we have obtained an assurance from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act that  in the event that any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax shall not  until march   be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares  debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or to any taxes payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda 
consequently  the provision for income taxes recorded relates to income earned by certain subsidiaries of the company which are located in  or earn income in  jurisdictions that impose income taxes  primarily ireland and the united states 
all of our aircraft owning subsidiaries that are recognized as corporations for us tax purposes are us corporations 
these non us subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the united states and typically are not subject to us federal  state or local income taxes unless they operate within the us  in which case they may be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
we also have a u 
s based subsidiary which provides management services to our non us subsidiaries and is subject to non us federal  state and local income taxes 
in addition  those subsidiaries that are resident in ireland are subject to irish tax 
segments we operate in a single segment 
history aircastle limited  formerly aircastle investment limited  is a bermuda exempted company that was incorporated on october  by fortress investment group llc and certain of its affiliates 
acquisitions and dispositions we originate acquisitions and dispositions through well established relationships with airlines  other aircraft lessors  financial institutions and brokers  as well as other sources 
we believe that sourcing such transactions both globally and through multiple channels provides for a broad and relatively consistent set of opportunities 
on june   we entered into an acquisition agreement  which we refer to as the airbus a agreement  under which we agreed to acquire new a aircraft  or the new a aircraft  from airbus 
during  we acquired two new a aircraft 
we currently have ten new a aircraft remaining to be delivered  with two scheduled for delivery in  seven in and one in our objective is to develop and maintain a diverse and stable operating lease portfolio and  in that regard  our investment strategy is oriented towards longer term holding horizons rather than shorter term trading 
however  we review our operating lease portfolio periodically to make opportunistic divestures of aircraft and to manage our portfolio diversification 
in we sold eight aircraft and in

finance our debt financing arrangements are typically secured by aircraft and related operating leases  and in the case of our securitizations and pooled aircraft term financings  the financing parties have limited recourse to aircastle limited 
while such financing has historically been available on reasonable terms given the loan to value profile we have pursued  the recent financial markets turmoil has reduced the availability of both debt and equity capital 
though we expect the financing market to continue to improve in time  current market conditions remain difficult and we are presently taking a very cautious approach to incremental financing and with respect to refinancing risk  which may constrain our ability to undertake new transactions 
during the near term  we intend to focus our efforts on investment opportunities that both tap commercial financial capacity where it accessible on reasonable terms and also where there is potential availability of debt financing that benefits from government guarantees either from the ecas or from exim 
to the extent that we acquire additional aircraft directly  we intend to fund such investments through medium to longer term financings and cash on hand 
we may repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long term debt financings  additional equity offerings or cash generated from operations 
therefore  our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation 
table of contents assets  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive

the decrease in lease rental revenue of million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily the result of decreases of million of revenue as a result of aircraft sales eight aircraft were sold during and three aircraft were sold during million of revenue due to downtime in connection with aircraft in transition and freighter conversions  million of revenue due to lower floating rate lease rentals and lease rate changes 

table of contents these decreases were offset partially by an increase in revenue of million due to the effect of a full year of lease rental revenue from the acquisition of five new aircraft purchased during the first half of and additional rental revenue from two new aircraft purchased during amortization of net lease discounts and lease incentives 
the decrease in amortization of net lease discounts and lease incentives of million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in results from the decrease in amortization of net lease discounts of million and an increase in amortization of lease incentives of million for aircraft transitions 
maintenance revenue 
the increase in maintenance revenue of million is the result of million of higher maintenance revenue from scheduled lease terminations million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  and million of maintenance revenue from early terminations of leases million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  
interest income 
the decrease in interest income of million was due primarily to the sale of two of our debt investments in february and our remaining debt investments which were sold in the third and fourth quarters of other revenue 
the increase in other revenue of million is due primarily to additional fees paid by lessees in connection with the early termination of four leases 
the early termination of the four leases  along with a change in the forecasted cash flows  triggered an impairment for the related two boeing model aircraft and two boeing model aircraft in the amount of million for the year ended december  see impairment of aircraft below 
for the year ended december   the company received million  of which million represented lease termination payments included in other revenue and million related to maintenance revenue from the previous lessees of these aircraft

table of contents interest  net decreased by million  or  over the year ended december  the net decrease is primarily a result of a million decrease in interest expense on our borrowings due primarily to a lower average debt balance average debt balance during the year ended december  was billion as compared to billion in the same period in and lower interest rates during as compared to  a million decrease resulting from changes in measured hedge ineffectiveness due primarily to prior year debt changes  a million decrease in amortization of deferred losses on interest rate derivatives due primarily to million decrease related to accelerated amortization of deferred losses from terminated interest rate derivatives for borrowings that we are no longer making ie  that are no longer probable of occurring as a result of a lower forecasted debt financings 
this decrease was offset by million increase related to amortization of deferred losses on terminated interest rate derivatives for borrowings we anticipate making in the future ie  that are probable of occurring 
the deferred losses are amortized into interest expense as the interest payments being hedged occur  a million decrease in amortization of deferred financing fees resulting primarily from the closing of our revolving credit facilities during  and a million decrease in hedge termination charges 
these decreases were offset partially by a million decrease in interest income earned on our cash balances  resulting from significantly lower interest rates during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  and a million decrease in capitalized interest due to lower interest rates during the year ended december  compared to the same period in and the delivery of aircraft from freighter conversion and the manufacturer 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  for the year ended december  decreased slightly over the same period in our headcount decreased from employees at december  to employees at december  non cash share based expense was million in and million in  respectively 
impairment of aircraft was million during the year ended december  which related to two boeing model aircraft and two boeing model aircraft 
the impairment was triggered by the early termination of the related leases and changes to estimated future cash flows 
see maintenance revenue and other revenue above for additional information 
maintenance and other costs was million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the same period in  primarily as a result of million in aircraft maintenance and other transition costs relating to unscheduled lease terminations for eight aircraft returned to us in  million in aircraft maintenance and other transition costs relating to unscheduled lease terminations for eight aircraft returned to us in and transitioned to new lessees in  million in aircraft maintenance and transition costs for four aircraft in freighter conversion  and 
table of contents million in aircraft maintenance and transition costs relating to scheduled lease terminations for six aircraft returned to us in other income expense total other income for the year ended december  was million as compared to a million expense for the same period in  or an increase in income of million 
the increase is primarily a result of million lower mark to market adjustments on our undesignated interest rate derivatives  a million increase in the gain on sale of debt investments  and a million gain on the purchase and re sale of a spare engine 
these increases were offset partially by a million decrease in gain on sale of flight equipment for the three aircraft sold in compared to eight aircraft sold in  and a million termination fee to cancel our engine purchase commitments for the new airbus a program 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
income taxes have been provided based on the applicable tax laws and rates of those countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned  primarily ireland and the united states

other comprehensive income other comprehensive income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the million of other comprehensive loss for the year ended december  the increase in comprehensive income is primarily a result of a million decrease in deferred losses resulting from a decrease in the net change in the fair value of outstanding interest rate derivatives qualifying for and designated as cash flow hedges due to significant decreases in the month libor rates during  causing large losses  and a leveling off of the month libor rates during month libor rates as of december   and were  and respectively  and 
table of contents a million increase in the fair value of debt investments as a result of the sale of our remaining debt investments in these increases in comprehensive income were offset partially by a million decrease in amortization into earnings of deferred net losses from terminated interest rate derivatives  a million decrease in gain on debt investments reclassified into earnings  and a million decrease in net income 
the amount of loss expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense over the next months consists of net interest settlements on active interest rate derivatives in the amount of million and the amortization of deferred net losses from terminated interest rate derivatives in the amount of million

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and currently available information 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most subjective judgments  estimates and assumptions 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
lease revenue recognition our operating lease rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we will neither recognize revenue nor record a receivable from a customer when collectability is not reasonably assured 
estimating whether collectability is reasonably assured requires some level of subjectivity and judgment 
when collectability is not reasonably assured  the customer is placed on non accrual status and revenue is recognized when cash payments are received 
management determines whether customers should be placed on non accrual status 
when we are reasonably assured that payments will be received in a timely manner  the customer is placed on accrual status 
the accrual non accrual status of a customer is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on factors such as the customer s credit rating  payment performance  financial condition and requests for modifications of lease terms and conditions 
events or circumstances outside of historical customer patterns can also result in changes to a customer s accrual status 
maintenance payments and maintenance revenue typically  under an operating lease  the lessee is responsible for performing all maintenance but might be required to make deposit payments to us for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and are required to be made monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
whether to permit a lessee to make maintenance payments at the end of the lease term  rather than requiring such payments to be made monthly  depends on a variety of factors  including the creditworthiness of the lessee  the level of security deposit which may be provided by the lessee and market conditions at the time we enter into the lease 
if a lessee is making monthly maintenance payments  we would typically be obligated to use the funds paid by the lessee during the lease term to reimburse the lessee for costs they incur for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components  usually shortly following completion of the relevant work 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our contractual commitment to refund such receipts as discussed above 
in these contracts  we do not recognize such maintenance payments as maintenance revenue during the lease 
reimbursements to the lessee upon the receipt of evidence of qualifying maintenance work are charged against the existing accrued maintenance liability 
we defer maintenance revenue recognition of all maintenance reserve payments collected until the end of the lease  when we are able to determine the amount  if any  by which reserve payments received exceed costs to be incurred by the current lessee in performing scheduled maintenance 

table of contents lease incentives many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of the lessee s costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components 
we account for these expected payments as lease incentives  which are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the lease 
we estimate the amount of our portion for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated amount of the maintenance event cost and the estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated lease incentive is not recognized as a lease incentive liability at the inception of the lease 
we recognize the lease incentive as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  with the offset being recorded as a lease incentive liability which is included in maintenance payments on the balance sheet 
the payment to the lessee for the lease incentive liability is first recorded against the lease incentive liability and any excess above the lease incentive liability is recorded as a prepaid lease incentive asset which is included in other assets on the balance sheet and continues to amortize over the remaining life of the lease 
flight equipment held for lease flight equipment held for lease is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  typically over a year life from the date of manufacture for passenger aircraft and over a year life for freighter aircraft  depending on whether the aircraft is a converted or purpose built freighter  to estimated residual values 
estimated residual values are generally determined to be approximately of the manufacturer s estimated realized price for passenger aircraft when new and for freighter aircraft when new 
management may make exceptions to this policy on a case by case basis when  in its judgment  the residual value calculated pursuant to this policy does not appear to reflect current expectations of value 
examples of situations where exceptions may arise include but are not limited to flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturer s realized sales prices are not relevant eg  freighter conversions  flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturers realized sales prices are not readily available  and flight equipment which may have a shorter useful life due to obsolescence 
in accounting for flight equipment held for lease  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  the fair value of attached leases  acquired maintenance liabilities and the estimated residual values 
in making these estimates  we rely upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
as part of our due diligence review of each aircraft we purchase  we prepare an estimate of the expected maintenance payments and any excess costs which may become payable by us  taking into consideration the then current maintenance status of the aircraft and the relevant provisions of any existing lease 
for planned major maintenance activities for aircraft off lease  the company capitalizes the actual maintenance costs by applying the deferral method 
under the deferral method  we capitalize the actual cost of major maintenance events  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over the period until the next event is required 
determining the fair value of attached leases requires us to make assumptions regarding the current fair values of leases for specific aircraft 
we estimate a range of current lease rates of like aircraft in order to determine if the attached lease is within a fair value range 
if a lease is below or above the range of current lease rates  we present value the estimated amount below or above fair value range over the remaining term of the lease 
the resulting lease discount or premium is amortized into lease rental income over the remaining term of the lease 

table of contents we perform a recoverability assessment of all aircraft in our fleet  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  at least annually 
in addition  a recoverability assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances  or indicators  indicate that the carrying amount or net book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
indicators may include  but are not limited to  a significant lease restructuring or early lease termination  significant air traffic decline  the introduction of newer technology aircraft or engines  an aircraft type is no longer in production or a significant airworthiness directive is issued 
when we perform a recoverability assessment  we measure whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the aircraft exceed its net book value 
the undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted leases  future projected lease rates  transition costs  estimated down time and estimated residual or scrap values for an aircraft 
in the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test  the aircraft will be adjusted to fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
see further discussion under fair value measurements 
management develops the assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on its knowledge of active lease contracts  current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry  as well as information received from third party industry sources 
the factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates  residual values  economic conditions  technology  airline demand for a particular aircraft type and many of the risk factors discussed in item a 
risk factors 
we recorded impairment charges related to four aircraft during the third quarter of the impairments related to two boeing model aircraft and two boeing model aircraft and were triggered by the early termination of leases and the resulting changes to estimated future cash flows 
in monitoring the aircraft in our fleet for impairment charges  we identify those aircraft that are most susceptible to failing the recoverability assessment and monitor those aircraft more closely  which may result in more frequent recoverability assessments 
the recoverability in the value of these aircraft is more sensitive to changes in contractual cash flows  future cash flow estimates and residual values or scrap values for each aircraft 
these aircraft are typically older planes for which lessee demand is declining 
as of december   we had identified two boeing model aircraft  one boeing model aircraft and three boeing model er aircraft as being susceptible to failing the recoverability test 
these aircraft had a net book value of million at december  management believes that the net book value of each of these aircraft is currently supported by the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each aircraft  and as such  these aircraft are not impaired at december  derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
all interest rate derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we determine fair value for our united states dollar denominated interest rate derivatives by calculating reset rates and discounting cash flows based on cash rates  futures rates and swap rates in effect at the period close 
we determine the fair value of our united states dollar denominated guaranteed notional balance interest rate derivatives based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close 
the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the interest rate derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
the ineffective portion of the interest rate derivative is calculated and recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income at each quarter end 
for any interest rate derivatives not designated as a hedge  all mark to market adjustments are recognized in other income expense on our consolidated statement of income 
at inception of the hedge  we choose a method to assess effectiveness and to calculate ineffectiveness  which we must use for the life of the hedge relationship 
historically  we have designated the change in variable cash flows method for calculation of hedge ineffectiveness 
this methodology  which is only available for interest rate derivatives designated at execution with a fair value of zero  
table of contents involves a comparison of the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the interest rate derivative against the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
when the change in the interest rate derivative s variable leg exceeds the change in the liability  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
effectiveness is tested by dividing the change in the interest rate derivative s variable leg by the change in the liability 
we used the hypothetical trade method for hedge relationships designated after execution because those hedge relationships did not have an interest rate derivative fair value of zero  and therefore  did not qualify for the change in variable cash flow method 
the hypothetical trade method involves a comparison of the change in the fair value of an actual interest rate derivative to the change in the fair value of a hypothetical interest rate derivative with critical terms that reflect the hedged debt 
when the change in the value of the interest rate derivative exceeds the change in the hypothetical interest rate derivative  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
the effectiveness of these relationships is tested by regressing historical changes in the interest rate derivative against historical changes in the hypothetical interest rate derivative 
fair value measurements we measure the fair value of interest rate derivative assets and liabilities on a recurring basis 
fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level maximizes the use of observable inputs  including contractual terms  interest rate curves  cash rates and futures rates and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs  including an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we use our interest rate derivative counterparty s valuation of our interest rate derivatives to validate our models 
our interest rate derivatives are sensitive to market changes in month libor as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level includes a significant unobservable market input to value the option component of the guaranteed notional balance 
the guaranteed notional balance has an upper notional band that matches the hedged debt on term financing no 
and a lower notional band 
the notional balance is guaranteed to match the hedged debt balance if the debt balances decrease within the upper and lower notional band 
the range of the guaranteed notional between the upper and lower band represents an option that may not be exercised independently of the debt notional balance 
the fair value of the interest rate derivative is determined based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at the relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close and incorporates an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we also measure the fair value of aircraft on a non recurring basis when gaap requires the application of fair value  including events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amounts of aircraft may not be recoverable 
we principally use the income approach to measure the fair value of these assets 
the income approach is based on the present value of cash flows from contractual lease agreements and projected future lease payments  net of expenses  which extend to the end of the aircraft s economic life in its highest and best use configuration  as well as a disposition value based on expectations of market participants 

table of contents income taxes aircastle uses an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount estimated by us to be realizable 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification tm asc 
the asc is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  upon the effective date  the asc became the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
the codification does not replace or affect guidance issued by the sec or its staff for public companies in their filings with the sec 
effective july   changes to the asc are communicated through an accounting standards update asu 
the company adopted the asc during the third quarter of  and as a result  all references to prior accounting and reporting standards which have been superseded by the asc have been changed to reflect the new reference within the asc 
the asc does not change or alter existing us gaap and  therefore  it did not impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
effective january   asc derivatives and hedging  required enhanced derivative and hedging disclosures  which are intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities  and to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the adoption of this asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
also effective january   asc earnings per share  determined that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividend or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and should be included in the computation for the purpose of applying the two class method when calculating earnings per share eps 
the adoption requires us to present eps using the two class method for our current period eps computations and to retrospectively revise our comparative prior period eps computations using the two class method 
the adoption did not have a material effect on eps 
effective the second quarter of  asc fair value measurements and disclosures  provided additional guidelines for making fair value measurements and identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
also effective the second quarter of  asc financial instruments  enhanced consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures to include interim as well as annual reports 
the adoption of these asc s did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective the second quarter of  asc investments debt and equity securities  provided additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting for  and presenting losses on  debt securities 
this guidance included determining whether impairments on debt securities were other than temporary and it modified the presentation and disclosures surrounding such instruments 
the adoption of this asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents also effective the second quarter of  asc subsequent events  established general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of this asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued asu  an update to asc  subsequent events  to amend certain recognition and disclosure requirements to no longer require an sec filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated for both issued and revised financial statements 
it also eliminated the requirement for sec filers to disclose the date that the financial statements are available to be issued 
asu is effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation fin no 
r sfas no 
 which amends fin no 
r to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest  or interests  give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance 
this statement amends certain guidance in fin no 
r for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
sfas no 
will require a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
and anticipates that the adoption will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu  an update to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which provides guidance on measuring the fair value of liabilities under asc among other provisions  this update provides clarification that in circumstances  in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the valuation techniques described in asu asu was effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity currently are cash on hand  cash generated by our aircraft leasing operations and loans secured by new aircraft we acquire 
our business is very capital intensive  requiring significant investments in order to expand our fleet during periods of growth and investments in maintenance and improvements on our existing portfolio 
our business also generates a significant amount of cash from operations  primarily from lease rental revenue and maintenance revenue 
these sources have historically provided liquidity for these investments and for other uses  including the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
in the past  we have also met our liquidity and capital resource needs by utilizing several sources  including lines of credit  our securitizations  term financings and  more recently  secured borrowings supported by export credit agencies for new aircraft acquisitions  public offerings of common shares  and asset sales 
while the financing structures for our securitizations and certain of our term financings include liquidity facilities  these liquidity facilities are primarily designed to provide short term liquidity to enable the financing vehicles to remain current on principal and interest payments during periods when 
table of contents the relevant entities incur substantial unanticipated expenditures 
because these facilities have priority in the payment waterfall and therefore must be repaid quickly  and because we do not anticipate being required to draw on these facilities to cover operating expenses  we do not view these liquidity facilities as an important source of liquidity for us 
during the year ended december   we acquired two aircraft and made capital expenditures including lease incentives to our aircraft portfolio totaling million 
the two aircraft were financed by million of export credit agency supported loans 
we also funded million of pre delivery payments including buyer furnished equipment on our new a aircraft 
during  we expect to fund approximately million of total payments for our new a aircraft  comprising both pre delivery and delivery payments to airbus and buyer furnished equipment suppliers 
for the two new a aircraft being delivered in see purchase obligations in contractual obligations below we expect to debt finance to of the total cost of these aircraft upon delivery 
after taking into consideration pre delivery and buyer furnished equipment payments and the anticipated debt financing  we expect to receive million to million in net cash upon delivery of these two new a aircraft 
in addition  as of december   we expect capital expenditures and lessee maintenance payment draws on our aircraft portfolio during to be approximately million to million  excluding purchase obligation payments  and we expect maintenance collections from lessees on our owned aircraft portfolio to be approximately equal to the expected expenditures and draws over the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that the capital expenditures  our contributions to maintenance events and lessee maintenance payment draws described above will not be greater than expected or that our expected maintenance payment collections or disbursements will equal our current estimates 
in march  we completed our annual appraisal for term financing no 
and determined that initially we will not meet the loan to value requirement and consequently  we anticipate that we will be obliged to make approximately million in supplemental principal payments in under term financing no 
in addition to scheduled principal payments 
to the extent that supplemental principal payments are required  availability of excess cash flow for other purposes will be reduced 
we believe that cash on hand  funds generated from operations  maintenance payments received from lessees  proceeds from contracted aircraft sales and funds we expect to borrow upon delivery of the new a aircraft we acquire in future periods  including borrowings under export credit agency supported loan facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months 
our liquidity and capital resource needs include pre delivery payments under the airbus a agreement  payments for buyer furnished equipment  payments due at delivery of the new a aircraft  required and supplemental principal payments we anticipate being required to make under term financing no 
 expected capital expenditures  lessee maintenance payment draws and lease incentives over the next twelve months 
potential asset sales and a pre delivery payment financing facility may provide additional sources of liquidity as well

if the debt service coverage ratio requirements are not met on two consecutive monthly payment dates  all excess cash flows will thereafter be applied to prepay the principal balance of the loans until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds the minimum level 
compliance with these covenants depends substantially upon the appraised value of the aircraft securing term financing no 
and the timely receipt of lease payments from its lessees 
we refer to any prepayments of principal following noncompliance with the loan to value or debt service coverage ratios as supplemental principal payments 
a maintenance adjusted appraisal of term financing no 
portfolio must be completed each year before a date in early may by a specified appraiser 
to determine the maintenance adjusted values  the appraiser applies upward or downward adjustments to its half life current market values for the aircraft in the term financing no 
portfolio based upon the maintenance status of the airframe  engines  landing gear and the auxiliary power unit  or apu  and applies certain other upward or downward adjustments for equipment and capabilities and for utilization 
compliance with the loan to value ratio is measured each month by comparing the minimum ratio against the most recently completed maintenance adjusted appraised value  less for each month since such appraisal was provided to the lenders  plus of the cash maintenance reserve balance held on deposit for the term financing no 
portfolio 
noncompliance with the loan to value ratio will require us to make supplemental principal payments but will not by itself result in a default under term financing no 
in march  we completed the maintenance adjusted appraisal for the term financing no 
portfolio and determined that  based upon the appraiser s january current market values for the aircraft and the relevant maintenance adjustments  we expect that the appraisal will indicate an april loan to value ratio of approximately and therefore we do not expect to meet the loan to value requirement until supplemental principal payments are made 
we estimate that approximately

on september   one of our subsidiaries  acs limited  or acs bermuda  entered into a five year  million term debt facility  which we refer to as term financing no 
 to finance a portfolio of nine aircraft 
the loans under term financing no 
were fully funded into an aircraft purchase escrow account on september  these loans were released to us from escrow as each of the financed aircraft was transferred into the facility 
in the third quarter  the loans with respect to seven aircraft were released to us upon transfer  and in fourth quarter  the loans with respect to two aircraft were released to us upon transfer 
one aircraft was subsequently sold in december loans under term financing no 
are secured by  among other things  first priority security interests in  and pledges or assignments of ownership interests in  the aircraft owning entities and other subsidiaries which are part of the financing structure  as well as by interests in aircraft leases  cash collections and other rights and properties they may hold 
however  the loans are neither obligations of  nor guaranteed by  aircastle limited 
the loans mature on september  we generally retained the right to receive future cash flows from the aircraft securing term financing no 
after the payment of claims that are senior to our rights  including  but not limited to  payment of expenses related to the aircraft  fees of administration and fees and expenses of service providers  interest and principal on the loans  and amounts owed to interest rate hedge providers 
however  term financing no 
requires that approximately of the cash flow remaining after expenses  fees  interest and amounts owed to interest rate hedge providers will be applied to reduce the principal balance of the loans  and in any case distribution of any excess cash flow to us is subject to continuing compliance with the term financing no 
loan documents 
borrowings under term financing no 
bear interest on the basis of three month libor plus per annum or  if greater  on the basis of the lenders cost of funds rate plus a margin  currently per annum 
the loans provide for quarterly payments of interest and scheduled payments of principal 
the loans may be prepaid upon notice  subject to certain conditions  and the payment of expenses  if any  and in some cases the payment of a prepayment premium on amounts prepaid on or before september  term financing no 
requires our relevant subsidiaries to satisfy certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of loan to value and interest coverage ratios 
the loan to value ratio begins at of appraised value and reduces over time to of appraised value approximately months after closing 
the interest coverage test compares available cash  being the amount by which rentals received in the preceding six month period exceeds any re leasing costs and servicing fees  to interest on the loans net of interest rate hedging during that period 
the interest coverage ratio tests  on any quarterly payment date  whether available cash exceeds net interest costs by a factor of three rising over time to five in the fifth year after closing  and the covenant will be breached if the test fails on any two consecutive quarterly payment dates 
compliance with these covenants depends substantially upon the appraised value of the aircraft securing term financing no 
 the timely receipt of lease payments from the relevant lessees and on our ability to utilize the cure rights provided to us in the loan documents 
failure to comply with the loan to value test  or to comply with the interest coverage test at a time when we are also in breach of a modified version of the loan to value test  would result in a default under term financing no 
in the absence of cure payments by us

in december  we entered into a twelve year million term loan with calyon  which is also supported by a guarantee from coface  for the financing of a new airbus model a aircraft

we refer to these coface supported financings as eca term financings 
the obligations outstanding under the eca term financings are secured by  among other things  a mortgage over the aircraft and a pledge of our ownership interest in our subsidiary company that leases the aircraft to the operator 
the eca term financings documents contain a million minimum net worth covenant for aircastle limited  as well as a material adverse change default and cross default to any other recourse obligation of aircastle limited  and other terms and conditions customary for eca supported financings being completed at this time 
in addition  aircastle limited has guaranteed the repayment of the eca term financings

and million of which was used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the remainder of the net proceeds was used for other general corporate purposes 
on october   the company completed a second follow on public offering of  primary common shares at a public offering price of per share  including  common shares pursuant to the underwriter s option to cover over allotments  resulting in gross proceeds from the offering of million before offering costs 
the net proceeds of the offering  after our payment of million in underwriting discounts and commissions  and approximately million in offering expenses were million 
approximately million of the proceeds was used to repay borrowings under amended credit facility no 
the remainder of the net proceeds was used for aircraft acquisitions and working capital requirements 
in conjunction with the second follow on public offering  certain fortress shareholders offered  secondary common shares in the public offering  including  common shares from the selling fortress shareholders pursuant to the underwriter s option to cover over allotments 
the company did not receive any funds from this secondary offering by the selling fortress shareholders 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of principal and interest payments on variable rate liabilities  interest payments on interest rate derivatives  purchase obligations under the airbus a agreement  obligations under our freighter conversion contracts and rent payments pursuant to our office leases 
total contractual obligations decreased from billion at december  to approximately billion at december  due primarily to principal and interest payments made under our securitizations and term financings  and lower variable interest rates and payments made under our purchase obligations

at december   we had aircraft purchase agreements and freighter conversion agreements  including the acquisition of new a aircraft from airbus 
for the two new a aircraft being delivered in  we expect to debt finance to of the total cost of these aircraft upon delivery 
after taking into consideration pre delivery and buyer furnished equipment payments and the anticipated debt financing  we expect to receive million to million in net cash upon delivery 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with improvements made to our aircraft 
these expenditures include the cost of major overhauls necessary to place an aircraft in service and modifications made at the request of lessees 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred a total of million  million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures including lease incentives related to the acquisition and improvement of aircraft 
as of december   the weighted average age by net book value of our aircraft was approximately years 
in general  the costs of operating an aircraft  including maintenance expenditures  increase with the age of the aircraft 
under our leases  the lessee is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft 
we may incur additional maintenance and modification costs in the future in the event we are required to remarket an aircraft or a lessee fails to meet its maintenance obligations under the lease agreement 
at december   we had million of maintenance reserves as a liability on our balance sheet 
these maintenance reserves are paid by the lessee to provide for future maintenance events 
provided a lessee performs scheduled maintenance of the aircraft  we are required to reimburse the lessee for scheduled maintenance payments 
in certain cases  we are also required to make lessor contributions  in excess of amounts a lessee may have paid  towards the costs of maintenance events performed by or on behalf of the lessee 
actual maintenance payments to us by lessees in the future may be less than projected as a result of a number of factors  including defaults by the lessees 
maintenance reserves may not cover the entire amount of actual maintenance expenses incurred and  where these expenses are not otherwise covered by the lessees  there can be no assurance that our operational cash flow and maintenance reserves will be sufficient to fund maintenance requirements  particularly as our aircraft age 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our leases if lessees are unable to fund their maintenance requirements on our aircraft  our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common shares could be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  foreign currency risk and foreign operations at december   all of our lease rentals are payable to us in us dollars 
however  we incur euro and singapore dollar denominated expenses in connection with our subsidiary in ireland and branch office in singapore 
as of december   ten of our employees were based in ireland and three employees were based in singapore 
for the year ended december   expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  such as payroll and office costs  aggregated approximately million in us dollar equivalents and represented approximately of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
our international operations are a significant component of our business strategy and permit us to more effectively source new aircraft  service the aircraft we own and maintain contact with our lessees 
therefore  it is likely that our international operations and our exposure to foreign currency risk will increase over time 
although we have not yet entered into foreign currency hedges because our exposure to date has not been significant  if our foreign currency 
table of contents exposure increases we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to mitigate this risk 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred insignificant net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
hedging the objective of our hedging policy is to adopt a risk averse position with respect to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have entered into a number of interest rate derivatives to hedge the current and expected future interest rate payments on our variable rate debt 
interest rate derivatives are agreements in which a series of interest rate cash flows are exchanged with a third party over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on an interest rate derivative is not exchanged 
our interest rate derivatives typically provide that we make fixed rate payments and receive floating rate payments to convert our floating rate borrowings to fixed rate obligations to better match the largely fixed rate cash flows from our investments in flight equipment

all of our counterparties or guarantors of these counterparties are considered investment grade senior unsecured ratings of a or above by moody s investors service and long term foreign issuer ratings of bbb or above by standard and poor s

historically  the company acquired its aircraft using short term credit facilities and equity 
the short term credit facilities were refinanced by securitizations or term debt facilities secured by groups of aircraft 
the company completed two securitizations and two term financings during through see securitizations and term debt financings 
the company entered into interest rate derivatives to hedge interest payments on variable rate debt for acquired aircraft as well as aircraft that it expected to acquire within certain future periods 
in conjunction with its financing strategy  the company used interest rate derivatives for periods ranging from to years to fix the interest rates on the variable rate debt that it incurred to acquire aircraft in anticipation of the expected securitization or term debt re financings 
at the time of each re financing  the initial interest rate derivatives were terminated and new interest rate derivatives were executed as required by each specific debt financing 
at the time of each interest rate derivative termination  certain interest rate derivatives were in a gain position and others were in a loss position 
since the hedged interest payments for the variable rate debt associated with each terminated interest rate derivative were probable of occurring  the gain or loss was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized into interest expense over the relevant period for each interest rate derivative 
prior to the securitizations and term debt financings  our interest rate derivatives typically required us to post cash collateral to the counterparty when the value of the interest rate derivative exceeded a defined threshold 
when the interest rate derivatives were terminated and became part of a larger aircraft portfolio financing  there were no cash collateral posting requirements associated with the new interest rate derivative 
as of december   we did not have any cash collateral pledged under our interest rate derivatives  nor do we have any existing agreements that require cash collateral postings 
generally  our interest rate derivatives are hedging current interest payments on debt and future interest payments on long term debt 
in the past  we have entered into forward starting interest rate derivatives to hedge the anticipated interest payment on long term financings 
these interest rate derivatives were terminated and new  specifically tailored interest rate derivatives were entered into upon closing of the relevant long term financing 
we have also early terminated interest rate derivatives in an attempt to manage our exposure to collateral calls

these interest rate derivatives were originally executed to hedge expected interest payments related to actual and forecasted borrowings related to the acquisition and related financing for new a aircraft 
we terminated these interest rate derivatives to limit our exposure to cash collateral calls 
the deferred losses will be amortized into interest expense over the relevant periods since the expected debt associated with the acquisition of these aircraft is still probable of occurring 
some level of hedge ineffectiveness has occurred and may continue to occur due to the changes in the expected number of new a aircraft to be acquired  the timing of such future deliveries  and  the level of debt associated with each new a aircraft at delivery 
to limit our exposure to interest rate changes in relation to the anticipated long term financings required for six of our new a aircraft  we entered into lease agreements which adjust the lease rentals to changes in the seven year swap rate at delivery  at which time  the lease rentals will be fixed for the lease term

as discussed in hedging above  we terminated certain interest rate derivatives to limit our exposure to these margin calls and therefore we have no future liquidity exposure to these terminated interest rate contracts 
in addition  we terminated the repurchase agreement in early inflation inflation generally affects our costs  including sg a expenses and other expenses 
inflation also will increase the price of the airframes and engines we purchase under the airbus af agreement  although we have agreed with the manufacturers to certain limitations on price escalation in order to reduce our exposure to inflation

we do not believe that our financial results have been  or will be  adversely affected by inflation in a material way 
management s use of ebitda we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non us gaap measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
accordingly  this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure  or expenses  of the organization 
ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business 
limitations of ebitda ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for us gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate ebitda  and using this non us gaap financial measure as compared to us gaap net income  include depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our aircraft  which affects the aircraft s availability for use and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  and the cash portion of income tax benefit provision generally represents charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results 
an investor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use non us gaap financial measures to supplement our us gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 

table of contents ebitda is not an alternative to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
you should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any such us gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of ebitda to us gaap net income  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under us gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the ebitda measure  as presented in this annual report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income to ebitda for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands net income depreciation amortization of net lease discounts and lease incentives interest  net income tax provision earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization management believes that adjusted net income ani and adjusted net income plus depreciation and amortization anida  when viewed in conjunction with the company s results under gaap and the below reconciliation  provide useful information about operating and period over period performance  and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting and gains or losses related to flight equipment and debt investments 
additionally  management believes that anida provides investors with an additional metric to enhance their understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made  debt is serviced and dividends are paid 
however  ani and anida are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates 
these risks are highly sensitive to many factors  including us monetary and tax policies  us and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control 
we are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our lease agreements  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate derivatives 
rent payments under our aircraft lease agreements typically do not vary during the term of the lease according to changes in interest rates 
however  our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index  such as libor 
therefore  to the extent our borrowing costs are not fixed  increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities 
changes in interest rates may also impact our net book value as our interest rate derivatives are periodically marked to market through stockholders equity 
generally  we are exposed to loss on our fixed pay interest rate derivatives to the extent interest rates decrease below their contractual fixed rate 
the relationship between spreads on derivative instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decrease 
changes in the general level of interest rates can also affect our ability to acquire new investments and our ability to realize gains from the settlement of such assets 
sensitivity analysis the following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of hypothetical interest rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations 
we changed our interest rate risk disclosure to an alternative that provides a more meaningful analysis of our interest rate risk 
although we believe a sensitivity analysis provides the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec  it is constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by the inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
although the following results of a sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rates may have some limited use as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as a forecast 
this forward looking disclosure also is selective in nature and addresses only the potential minimum contracted rental and interest expense impacts on our financial instruments and our four variable rate leases and  in particular  does not address the mark to market impact on our interest rate derivatives 
it also does not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rates would increase decrease the minimum contracted rentals on our portfolio as of december  by million and million  respectively  over the next twelve months 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rate on our borrowings would result in an interest expense increase decrease of million and million  respectively  net of amounts received from our interest rate derivatives  over the next twelve months
