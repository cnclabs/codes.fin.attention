overview we are a development stage company formed to commercialize flexible photovoltaic pv modules using our proprietary technology 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately million of revenue 
substantially all of our revenue was from government research and development contracts 
our planned principal operations are to commercialize flexible cigs pv modules 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
currently our fab production line is being installed and commissioned 
under our current business plan  we expect losses to continue until production reaches an annual rated capacity of approximately mw or more 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private equity financings 
on october   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock and a private placement to our largest shareholder  norsk hydro produksjon as hydro  of  shares 
the offering price was per share resulting in total net proceeds of 
table of contents approximately million 
the proceeds from the stock sales are intended to be utilized to fund equipment purchases for fab in thornton  colorado  as well as the funding of negative operating cash flows as we ramp up production levels 
while focused on speed to market  we believe that quality and consistency of product will be paramount to our success in the marketplace 
consequently  our path to commercialization is defined by a highly disciplined  staged progression based upon the achievement of key milestones and supported by over fifteen years of concerted research and development activity by our scientists 
our progression also takes into account market conditions  as well as financing options 
in keeping with our philosophy  we completed construction of our fab production line in december in march  we demonstrated ioc of the fab production line by initiating production trials as an end to end integrated process 
early ioc production trials resulted in average thin film device efficiencies of and small area monolithically integrated module efficiencies of over 
during optimization trials resulted in thin film device efficiencies in the to range and corresponding module efficiencies in the to range 
the test modules measured six inches wide by one foot long and currently serve as our building blocks for both bipv and portable power products 
during we focused on testing and qualifying our fab production line in anticipation of commencing production 
during the first quarter of  we began limited production of monolithically integrated flexible cigs modules on our fab production line and continued to provide sample modules to potential customers and development partners to explore integration of our products into new applications 
in june  we announced the fabrication of a five meter long cigs module  which we believe is the largest monolithically interconnected cigs module ever produced on polyimide and possibly the largest cigs module ever produced regardless of construction 
the cigs based thin film material used in the module was manufactured using our unique fab production line 
the module was encapsulated during the testing and qualification of equipment to be used in fab based on internal test and evaluation  this five meter long module weighed approximately two kilograms and produced watts under standard test conditions with an aperture area efficiency of 
this length is expected to serve as a baseline for the company s development of large area flexible bipv products with our strategic bipv partners 
in july  we obtained independent verification by the us department of energy s national renewable energy laboratory nrel that the modules produced from fab measured in conversion efficiency 
the modules tested at nrel were standard square centimeter modules produced on the company s fab production line 
in october  nrel verified our achievement of a manufacturing milestone of cell efficiency from fab we also announced a peak efficiency of for cigs modules manufactured at fab in august  we completed internal qualification testing of a flexible packaging solution which successfully passed the rigorous standard of one thousand  hours of damp heat testing relative humidity and c temperature guideline set forth by iec standards for performance and long term reliability of thin film solar modules 
in february  our premier centimeters by centimeters and two meter modules were certified by an independent laboratory on a variety of united states department of defense dod rugged standards known as mil std g 
commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan we intend to be the first company to manufacture in commercial quantities large  roll format  pv modules that use cigs on a flexible  plastic substrate 
our manufacturing expansion plan entails the design  installation  qualification  testing and operation of additional production tools to increase our rated production capacity 
in march  colorado governor  bill ritter  jr 
and other dignitaries joined us in the dedication of our world headquarters and fab building in thornton  colorado 
the fab building encompasses approximately  square feet of office and manufacturing space 
approximately of the total equipment planned for delivery into fab had been delivered by december  our current plan is to bring on line approximately to mw of capacity in fab in 
table of contents we currently expect that non bipv markets will constitute the majority of our product shipments in we now anticipate beginning external certification of bipv products  as required for market entry  during the second half of with technischer berwachungs verein t v and underwriters laboratory ul 
we are evaluating the timing of further expansion based on many factors that include  demand  market conditions  product certification  availability of financing  technical advances and other factors described in this annual report 
capital equipment expenditures and manufacturing costs since our formation in october  the majority of our cash outlays have gone toward the investment in capital equipment necessary to develop our manufacturing capabilities for producing the commercial products we envision 
we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future as we incrementally expand our rated capacity 
we recently applied for funding under the us department of energy loan guarantee program for our fab production line with a name plate capacity of mw per year 
we currently expect the capital expenditures for fab to total approximately million to million for manufacturing and development equipment and approximately million for the acquisition and renovation of our new manufacturing facility in thornton  colorado 
we also expect capital expenditures of approximately million for installation  qualification and other associated pre operating expenses related to the first fab expansion 
as of december   we have made actual cash payments of approximately million for the fab equipment including installation costs and approximately million for the building and renovations which are now substantially complete 
we expect to make the remaining payments of approximately million on the fab manufacturing equipment already delivered to our fab location in the first half of during the first quarter of  we began limited production of monolithically integrated flexible cigs modules from our fab production line 
in early we plan to complete equipment qualification for tools already delivered and we anticipate beginning production in fab in second quarter the timing and amount of our production capacity and actual output will depend on a number of technical factors such as module efficiency  production yield and throughput 
our projections of annual rated production capacity have been and continue to be based on assumptions about these and other factors and we periodically revisit and revise these assumptions to account for realized rates and measurements on our production lines 
to date  our realized module efficiencies have exceeded expectations 
anticipated production yield and throughput in fab will depend on successfully ramping up the production equipment 
we are currently in the process of qualifying the production tools that have been delivered into fab we have additional tools on order that have not been delivered into fab the output of fab in will depend on product demand  market conditions  technical factors  and the timing of the final qualification and delivery of tools into fab  although we currently expect to bring approximately mw to mw of rated capacity online in we have begun discussions with our equipment suppliers regarding delaying delivery of certain equipment and may incur additional charges as a result 
we intend to continue to optimize our manufacturing processes including throughput  efficiency and yield to improve product performance and reduce manufacturing costs 
we also intend to identify and evaluate suitable locations for new production lines for future expansion  domestically and abroad  that we believe will best serve our target markets and customers for future expansion 
significant trends  uncertainties and challenges we believe that the significant trends  uncertainties and challenges that directly or indirectly affect our financial performance and results of operations include our ability to achieve desired production yields  throughput  module efficiencies and other performance targets  and to obtain necessary or desired certifications for our pv modules  in a timely manner  
table of contents our ability to expand production in accordance with our plans set forth above under commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan  our ability to achieve projected operational performance and cost metrics  our ability to consummate strategic relationships with key partners  including original equipment manufacturer oem customers  system integrators  value added resellers and distributors who deal directly with manufacturers and end users in the bipv  portable power  eipv and government defense solar panel markets  the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our capital equipment purchases  manufacturing costs and the price of our planned pv modules  changes in the supply and demand for pv modules as well as fluctuations in selling prices for pv modules worldwide  our ability to manage the planned expansion of our manufacturing facilities  operations and personnel  and our ability and the ability of our distributors  suppliers and customers to manage operations and orders during the global financial crisis and financial downturn 
basis of presentation the company s activities to date have consisted substantially of raising capital  research and development  establishment of our fab production plant and the development of our fab expansion plant 
revenues to date have been generated from the company s governmental research and development r d contracts and have not been significant 
the company s planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules have not yet commenced 
accordingly  the company is considered to be in the development stage and has presented its financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for development stage companies that consists of additional disclosure of inception to date activity in our statements of operations  statements of stockholder s equity and comprehensive income loss and statements of cash flows 
cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid debt securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
the company maintains cash balances which may exceed federally insured limits 
the company does not believe that this results in significant credit risk 
investments the company has classified its investments as available for sale 
such investments are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices with the unrealized holding gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed using the specific identification method 
the company evaluates declines in market value for potential impairment 
if the decline results in a value below cost and is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established 
fair value estimates the fair value of an asset or liability is the amount at which it could be exchanged or settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
the carrying value for cash and cash equivalents  investments  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued property and equipment  accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
foreign currency translation bank account balances related to our forward contracts are translated to us dollars utilizing the period end exchange rate 
gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments in connection with our forward contracts are recorded within realized gain loss on forward contracts in other income expense on the statement of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue to date is from governmental research and development contracts under terms that are cost plus are cost plus fee or firm fixed price 
revenue from cost plus fee contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of direct costs plus allowable indirect costs and an allocable portion of the firm fixed fee 
revenue from firm fixed price contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  with costs and estimated profits included in contract revenue as work is performed 
if actual and estimated costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  provision is made currently for the loss anticipated on the contract 
patents at such time as the company is awarded patents  patent costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the legal life  or over their estimated useful lives  whichever is shorter 
as of december   the company had  of net patent costs  of which  represent costs net of amortization incurred for an awarded patent  and the remaining  represents costs incurred for patent applications filed 
amortization expense was  for each year ending december  and and  for the year ended december  property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at the original cost to the company 
assets are being depreciated over estimated useful lives of three to ten years using the straight line method  commencing when the asset is placed in service 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remainder of the lease term or the life of the improvements 
upon retirement or disposal  the cost of the asset disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
the company computes depreciation expense using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as presented in the table below 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease 
useful lives in years buildings manufacturing machinery and equipment furniture  fixtures  computer hardware software leasehold improvements life of lease interest capitalization we capitalize interest cost as part of the historical cost acquiring or constructing certain assets during the period of time required to get the asset ready for its intended use 
during and  these assets consisted of property  plant and equipment 
we capitalize interest to the extent that expenditures to acquire or construct an asset have occurred and interest cost has been incurred 
long lived assets we analyze our long lived tangible assets property and equipment and definitive lived intangible assets patents for impairment by assessing if the asset cost will be recoverable 
events that might cause impairment would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or group of assets combined with a history of such losses  significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
risks and uncertainties the company s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those associated with the ability to meet obligations  continuing losses  fluctuation in operating results  funding expansions  strategic alliances  financing arrangement terms that may restrict operations  regulatory issues  and competition 
the recent financial crisis and downturn and the resulting tightening in the credit markets have made it more difficult to raise additional capital to fulfill our expansion business plan 
additionally  us government contracts may be terminated prior to completion of full funding by the us government 

table of contents net loss per common share basic earnings per share include no dilution and are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential of securities that could share in the earnings of the company  similar to fully diluted earnings per share 
common stock equivalents consisting of class b warrants  ipo warrants representative warrants  and stock options outstanding as of december  of approximately million shares  have been omitted from loss per share because they are anti dilutive 
net loss per share was the same for both basic and diluted for the periods ended december   and research and development costs research and development costs are incurred during the process of researching and developing new products and enhancing our manufacturing processes and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation 
we expense these costs as incurred until the resulting product has been completed and tested and is ready for commercial manufacturing 
we also incur research and development expenses on our federal government research and development contracts and expense as incurred 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates as of the date of enactment 
interest and penalties  if applicable  would be recorded in operations 
the company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  officers  directors  and consultants based on estimated fair values 
the company estimates the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in the company s statements of operations 
stock based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  as necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant the company uses the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because the company s employee stock options may have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the company s employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies  which could materially impact the company s fair value determination 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock awards as our stock price on the grant date 
the accounting guidance for stock based compensation may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the accounting for stock based compensation in 
table of contents future periods  or if the company decides to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that the company records in the future may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period and could materially affect its loss from operations  net loss and net loss per share 
comprehensive income loss our comprehensive income loss consists of our net income loss and changes in unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments  the impact of which has been excluded from net loss 
we present our comprehensive income loss in the statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income and loss 
our accumulated other comprehensive income loss is presented as a component of equity in our balance sheets and consists of the cumulative amount of unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments that we have incurred since the inception of our business 
reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to the financial information to conform to the presentation 
such reclassifications had no effect on net loss and are primarily related to reclassifying costs between research and development costs and general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new accounting guidance on the accounting standards codification codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles accounting standards codification asc 
the codification is now the single source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles gaap applied by nongovernmental entities and supersedes all existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  emerging issues task force and related literature 
the codification eliminates the previous us gaap hierarchy and establishes one level of authoritative gaap 
all other literature is considered non authoritative 
the codification is not intended to change gaap but rather reorganize divergent accounting literature into an accessible and user friendly system 
the codification was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the codification as of september  and it impacted our disclosures by eliminating all references to pre codification standards  however there was no impact to our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and our activities to date have substantially consisted of raising capital  business and product development  research and development and the development of our fab production line and the construction of our fab production line 
research and development revenues 
our r d revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the majority of our r d revenues during the years ended december  and were revenues earned on our government r d contracts 
research and development

interest expense was for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  interest expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively was capitalized into our property and equipment 
interest incurred relates to our chfa loan utilized for our fab production facility expansion in thornton  colorado 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  interest income represents interest on cash and short term investments 
the decrease in interest income is due to significantly lower interest rates in as compared to as well as a lower average cash balance 
realized gain loss on investments 
realized gains on investments were  for the year ended december  compared to realized losses of  for the year ended december   an increase of  losses on our investments  primarily corporate securities  comprised the net loss during realized loss on forward contracts and unrealized loss on forward contracts 
for the year ended december  the realized loss on forward contracts was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  for the year ended december   the unrealized gain on forward contracts was  which offset the unrealized loss of  for the year ended december  resulting in an increase of  from prior year 
as of december  all forward contracts have now been settled resulting in the reversal of all unrealized gains and losses 
although the hedging activity is designed to fix the dollar amount to be expended  the asset purchased is recorded at the spot rate in effect as of the date of the payment to the supplier 
the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate has been reported as a loss on forward contract 
the forward contract was effective in fixing the amount to be paid to the supplier in dollar terms as of the date the forward contract was entered into

table of contents on october  the company completed a public offering with barclays capital inc acting as managing underwriter  and a concurrent private placement with its largest shareholder  hydro  yielding total net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments 
we currently expect the cost of fab will total approximately million to million for manufacturing and development equipment and approximately million for the acquisition of the building and renovation of the fab facility 
we also expect capital expenditures of approximately million for installation  qualification and other associated pre operating expenses related to the expansion 
as of december   we have made actual cash payments of approximately million for the fab manufacturing and development equipment  including installation costs and approximately million for the building and renovations that are now substantially complete 
we expect to make the remaining payments on the fab manufacturing and development equipment during the first half of for approximately million and the remaining payments subsequent to subject to market conditions for our product 
during the year ended december   the use of cash for operational expenses averaged approximately million per month and was related to pre manufacturing activities  research and development  business development and general corporate expenses 
our average monthly operational expense for the year ended december  of approximately million is net of average monthly r d revenues from our governmental contracts of approximately million 
a significant component of our costs for the year ended december  related to the qualification and hiring of additional personnel for operations in our fab production line and installation and qualification of our new fab production line along with company infrastructure costs to support our expansion 
we anticipate that our operational expenditures will continue to increase throughout as we increase the size of our workforce and scale up fab as of december   we had full time employees of which were manufacturing personnel 
we plan to continue to selectively increase our staff during as required 
we do not expect that our sales revenue in from the fab and fab production lines will support our operating cash requirements 
the company expects its current cash balance to be sufficient to cover its planned capital and operational expenditures for at least the next months based on currently known factors and limited projected revenues 
we expect that we may need to raise additional capital to cover our operating losses and future manufacturing capacity expansion 
we currently are pursuing various avenues to obtain additional capital for further expansion and have submitted materials in connection with a loan guarantee program sponsored by the us department of energy for our fab production line with name plate capacity of mw per year  and may explore raising money in the equity markets 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on january  the shelf registration was utilized in connection with our public offering of approximately million shares that closed on october  with gross proceeds of approximately million 
with the shelf registration  we may from time to time sell common stock  preferred stock  warrants or some combination in one or more offerings for up to million  the remaining amount available 
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december  our contractual commitments consist of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments  regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services 
we purchase raw materials  services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply  we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements 

table of contents payments due by year in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the debt 
purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed minimum  or variable price provision and the approximate timing of transactions 
a majority of our purchase obligations are conditional purchase obligations that have milestone based deliverables  such as the company s acceptance of design requirements and successful installation and commissioning of the equipment 
this table reflects conditional purchase obligations due to our equipment suppliers as committed 
currently  we are working with our suppliers to delay equipment deliveries with approximately million in remaining purchase obligations 
off balance sheet transactions as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the company is actively engaged in purchasing manufacturing equipment internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk 
our objective is to fix the dollar amount of our foreign currency denominated manufacturing equipment purchases at time of order 
although the hedging activity is designed to fix the dollar amount to be expended  the asset purchased is recorded at the spot rate in effect as of the date of the payment to the supplier 
the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate has been reported as a loss on forward contract 
in july and march  the company entered into fair value hedges utilizing forward contracts designed to match scheduled contractual payments to equipment suppliers which are denominated in euros and yen 
the total notional value of the euro forward contracts was million with various contract settlement dates beginning september  through july  the total notional value of the yen forward contracts was million with contract settlement dates of march and april all forward contracts have been settled as of december   however  not all payments have been made to our equipment suppliers 
included in cash and cash equivalents is  related to  and  related to  held as of december  in our bank account for future payments to our equipment suppliers 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign currencies  would have a positive or negative impact of approximately 
million on our results of operations 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate  make sales and buy materials 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation risk 
further  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses 

table of contents we currently have unhedged open purchase orders to an equipment supplier denominated in yen for approximately million 
a appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to this purchase obligation  would have a positive or negative impact of approximately 
million on our future cash flows 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
as of december   our cash equivalents consisted of money market funds and investments in us government securities  and high quality corporate securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
commodity and component risk failure to receive timely delivery of production tools from our equipment suppliers could delay our planned expansion of manufacturing capacity and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our planned expansion of manufacturing capacity and commercialization timeline depend on the timely delivery of production tools from our equipment suppliers 
the relationships with our chosen equipment suppliers are relatively new  and at this point in time we cannot be certain that the equipment orders we place with these suppliers will be fulfilled as we expect or in a timely manner 
we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials used in the manufacture of our pv modules 
we depend on a limited number of third party suppliers for key raw materials  and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver pv modules to customers in the required quality and quantity and at a price that is profitable to us 
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our pv modules or increase our manufacturing cost 
most of our key raw materials are either sole sourced or sourced by a limited number of third party suppliers 
as a result  the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations 
in addition  many of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials as we implement our planned expansion 
we may be unable to identify new suppliers in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms 
raw materials from new suppliers may also be less suited for our technology and yield pv modules with lower conversion efficiencies  higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than pv modules manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers 
if delivery of production tools or raw materials are not made on schedule or at all  then we might be unable to carry out our commercialization and manufacturing expansion plans  produce pv modules in the volumes and at the times that we expect or generate sufficient revenue from operations  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments  and forward foreign exchange contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  investments and forward foreign exchange contracts with various high quality financial institutions  and exposure is limited at any one institution 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counter party financial institutions
