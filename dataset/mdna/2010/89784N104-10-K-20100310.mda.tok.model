increase international presence we are confident that we are well positioned to further establish true religion brand jeans as a global premium apparel and accessories brand through our initiatives domestically and internationally

in  we expect to open branded retail stores in the united states and one in canada 
us wholesale net sales decreased to million 
in  our net sales to boutique customers decreased sharply  these customers were more impacted by the challenging retail environment as they generally depend to a larger extent on external financing 
our sales to major accounts  which consist of customers such as nordstrom  bloomingdale s  saks fifth avenue and neiman marcus  decreased from the prior year as these customers experienced a decline in sales of premium denim due to the economic recession 
partially offsetting these decreases was a slight increase in our sales to off price retailers of million to million 
sales to nordstrom  inc accounted for of our net sales in in  we expect this segment s sales to the off price retailers will be reduced by million as we will place a greater emphasis on regular price wholesale sales 
international net sales increased to million primarily due to increased sales to distributors in asia and europe 
our sales to customers in japan increased in as compared to because we terminated our japanese distributor in the second quarter of and established our own subsidiary  which is selling merchandise to wholesale accounts and operating three outlet stores 
our brand is less established outside the us  so this segment s sales are growing in spite of the challenging retail environment in many international markets as our brand gains greater exposure

outlet stores sales generate lower gross margins because the merchandise is sold at a discounted price

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period 
our management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other factors and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following 
table of contents discussion highlights the policies management believes are critical 
for a summary of all our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb statement no 
 an accounting standard which established the codification to become the single source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities  with the exception of guidance issued by the us securities and exchange commission the sec and its staff 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification is not intended to change gaap  but rather is expected to simplify accounting research by reorganizing current gaap into approximately accounting topics 
we adopted this accounting standard in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
the adoption of this accounting standard had no impact on retained earnings and did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sales recognition sales are recognized across all segments of the business when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility can be reasonably assured 
sales within our us wholesale and international segments are recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer 
sales are recorded net of estimates for returns  discounts  operational chargebacks and markdowns 
returns and allowances require pre approval by management and discounts are based on trade terms 
we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis using historical trends  seasonal results  and current economic and market conditions 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
retail store sales are recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers 
e commerce sales of products ordered through our retail internet site known as www 
truereligionbrandjeans 
com are recognized upon estimated delivery of the shipment to the customers 
e commerce sales also are reduced by an estimate of returns 
retail store sales and e commerce sales exclude sales taxes 
revenues from licensing arrangements are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements  generally based upon the higher of a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty levels and b a percentage of wholesale sales of licensed product by our licensees 
we recognize revenue associated with our gift cards upon redemption of the gift card 
uncollectible accounts management evaluates our accounts receivables to estimate if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgment is used  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts 
based on this information  management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible 

table of contents inventories slow moving merchandise is typically sold at prices exceeding our cost in our outlet retail stores or to wholesale customers who specialize in off price merchandise 
as of december   we recorded reserves for slow moving inventory of million based upon analysis of balances on hand by style  recent sales trends  projected future sales  and historical markdown trends 
stock based compensation we recognize restricted stock compensation expense for awards with only service conditions using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the entire award 
the requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award  which often is the vesting period 
if a portion of the restricted stock vests immediately or in another period such that the cumulative vested amount exceeds the cumulative straight line expense amount  we record compensation expense equal to at least the cumulative compensation expense of the vested amount of the restricted stock 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards with performance based conditions is recognized on an accelerated basis using the graded attribution method over the requisite service period 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we establish valuation allowances for tax benefits when we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
fasb asc accounting for income taxes fasb asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
in accordance with fasb asc  we regularly evaluate the likelihood of recognizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances  and information available 
for those benefits that we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained  we recognize the largest amount we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
we record interest and penalties  if any  on any underpayment of income taxes as a component of provision for income taxes and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively
