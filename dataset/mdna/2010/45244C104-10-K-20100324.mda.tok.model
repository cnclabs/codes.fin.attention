item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview general 
we provide software based computer enabled detection  or ced  products and solutions that use advanced signal processing software algorithms to detect and monitor objects in a designated field of view 
our technology analyzes the signal from a sophisticated sensor and passes the information along to management systems  controllers or directly to users 
our core products  the autoscope video vehicle detection system and the rtms radar detection system  operate using our proprietary software in conjunction with video cameras or radar and commonly available electronic components 
each of these systems is used by traffic managers primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and to enhance safety at intersections  main thoroughfares  freeways and tunnels 
autoscope systems are sold to distributors and end users of traffic management products in north america  the caribbean and latin america by econolite control products  inc  or econolite  our exclusive licensee in these regions 
we sell rtms systems to distributors and end users in north america 
we also sell both autoscope and rtms to distributors and end users in europe and asia through our european and hong kong subsidiaries  respectively 
end users of our products throughout the world are generally funded by government agencies responsible for traffic management or traffic law enforcement 
eis asset purchase 
on december   we purchased certain assets from eis electronic integrated systems inc  or eis  including its principal product line  the rtms system 
in its fiscal year ended september   eis had revenue of million  substantially all of which related to rtms sales 
our consolidated financial statements include revenue and expenses related to the operations of the former eis business from december  through december  trends and challenges in our business we believe the growth in our business can be attributed primarily to the following global trends worsening traffic caused by increased numbers of vehicles in metropolitan areas without corresponding expansions of road infrastructure  which has increased demand for our products  advances in information technology  which have made our products easier to market and implement  the continuing rise in funding allocations in large cities for centralized traffic management services  which has increased the ability of our primary end users to implement our products  and general increases in the cost effectiveness of electronics  which make our products more affordable for end users 
we believe our continued growth primarily depends upon continued adoption and governmental funding of intelligent transportation systems  or its  for traffic control in developed countries  countries in the developing world adopting above ground detection technology  such as video or radar  instead of in pavement loop technology to manage traffic  use of ced to provide solutions to security surveillance and environmental issues associated with increasing automobile use in metropolitan areas  and our ability to develop new products  such as hybrid ced devices incorporating  for example  radar and video technologies  that provide increasingly accurate information and enhance the end users ability to cost effectively manage traffic  security surveillance and environmental issues 
because our principal end users are governmental entities  we are faced with challenges related to potential delays in purchase decisions by those entities and changes in budgetary constraints 
these contingencies could result in significant fluctuations in our revenue between periods 
the current worldwide recession is further adding to the unpredictability of purchase decisions  creating more delays than usual and decreasing governmental budgets  and it is likely to continue to negatively affect our revenue 
we believe we will continue to be a beneficiary of the federal stimulus bill enacted early in  but it is difficult to determine the level of impact it has on our operations 
key financial terms and metrics revenue 
revenue historically has been derived from two sources royalties received from econolite for sales of the autoscope system in north america  the caribbean and latin america and revenue received from direct sales of autoscope systems in europe and asia 
royalties from econolite historically have provided the majority of our revenue 
we calculate the royalties using a profit sharing model where we split the gross profit on sales of autoscope product made through econolite 
this royalty arrangement has the benefit of decreasing our cost of revenues and our selling  marketing and product support expenses because these costs and expenses are borne primarily by econolite 
although this royalty model has a positive impact on our gross margin  it also negatively impacts our total revenue  which would be higher if all the sales made by econolite were made directly by us 
the royalty arrangement is exclusive under a long term agreement 
our acquisition of the rtms product line in december gives us an additional source of revenue that increased our overall revenue and helped to lessen fluctuations in our revenue from period to period due to our ownership of more than one product line and the higher volumes it brings  notwithstanding normal seasonality 
cost of revenue 
there is no cost of revenue related to royalties  as virtually all manufacturing  warranty and related costs are incurred by econolite 
cost of revenue related to direct product sales consists primarily of the amount charged by our third party contractors to manufacture the autoscope and rtms hardware platforms  which is influenced mainly by the cost of electronic components 
the cost of revenue also includes logistics costs and estimated expenses for product warranties and inventory reserves 
the key metric that we follow is achieving certain gross margin percentages by geographic region 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses fall into three categories selling  marketing and product support  general and administrative  and research and development 
selling  marketing and product support expenses consist of various costs related to sales and support of our products  including salaries  benefits and commissions paid to our personnel  commissions paid to third parties  travel  trade show and advertising costs  second tier technical support for econolite  and general product support  where applicable 
general and administrative expenses consist of certain corporate and administrative functions that support the development and sales of our products and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
general and administrative expenses reflect management  supervisory and staff salaries and benefits  legal and auditing fees  travel  rent and costs associated with being a public company  such as board of director fees  sarbanes oxley compliance  listing fees and annual reporting expenses 
research and development expenses consist mainly of salaries and benefits for our engineers and third party costs for consulting and prototyping 
we measure all operating expenses against our annually approved budget  which is developed with achieving a certain operating margin as a key focus 
also included in operating expenses is non cash expense for intangible asset amortization 
seasonality 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past due to the seasonality of our business 
our first quarter generally is the weakest due to weather conditions that make roadway construction more difficult in north america  europe and northern asia 
we expect such seasonality to continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our international revenues have a significant large project component  resulting in a varying revenue stream 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
history 
we were incorporated in the state of minnesota in december and began operations by pioneering the commercial application of wide area video vehicle detection for traffic management 
the technology underlying our products was initially developed at the university of minnesota 
in  the university was awarded a patent for that technology  which it exclusively licensed to us 
in  we sub licensed this technology to econolite  a leading manufacturer and seller of traffic control products in north america and the caribbean  to manufacture and distribute products incorporating the technology 
segments 
we currently operate in two reportable segments autoscope and rtms 
autoscope is our machine vision product line  and revenue consists of royalties all of which are received from econolite  as well as a portion of international sales 
rtms is our radar product line acquired in the eis asset purchase in december  and revenue consists of all north american sales and a portion of international sales 
all segment revenues are derived from external customers 
the following tables set forth selected unaudited financial information for each of the company s reportable segments in thousands for the year ended december  autoscope rtms total revenue depreciation amortization of intangible assets income before income taxes capital expenditures total assets for the year ended december  autoscope rtms total revenue depreciation amortization of intangible assets income before income taxes capital expenditures total assets results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of income data as a percent of total revenue and gross margin on international sales and royalties as a percentage of international sales and royalties  respectively 
year ended december  international sales north american sales royalties total revenue gross margin international sales gross margin north american sales gross margin royalties selling  marketing and product support general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles in process research and development income from operations income tax expense benefit net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
royalty income decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
we attribute the decrease in royalties to the economic recession in north america and its negative impact on state and federal spending 
north american sales  which are sales of rtms in north america  increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
international sales  which include both autoscope and rtms sales outside of north america  decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in international sales was mainly due to weakness in the asian market in the first half of revenue for the autoscope segment decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease related to lower royalties and weakness in asia as discussed above 
revenue for the rtms segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase resulted mainly as a result of improved sales in north america 
gross margins for international sales increased to in from in the increase resulted mainly from the increase in rtms revenue  which typically earns higher margins than autoscope  and to a lesser extent by a revenue mix shift to higher margin product within the autoscope product family 
gross margins for north american sales increased to in from in the change was impacted by fewer lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory in as compared to gross margins on royalty income remained consistent at in and we anticipate that gross margins for our international and north american sales will be in the ranges of to in  while we expect royalty gross margins will be in selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the selling  marketing and product support expense increased in as we invested in market expansion activities in europe and asia and realized the impact of headcount additions made late in we anticipate that selling  marketing and product support expense will increase in terms of actual expense in  as compared to  as we continue to invest in market expansion activities in europe and asia 
general and administrative expense decreased to million or of total revenue in  down from million or of total revenue in the general and administrative expenses decrease in resulted mainly from lower incentive pay expense and higher foreign currency transaction gains  which were partially offset by increased professional services expense 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase both in terms of actual costs and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was directly related to our investment in video radar hybrid solutions and tailored international offerings  development projects to reduce manufacturing costs  and the realization of the impact of headcount additions made late in we anticipate that research and development expense will increase both in terms of dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to as we continue to invest in hybrid and international offerings and manufacturing cost reduction projects 
amortization of intangibles expense was  in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eis asset purchase 
assuming there are no changes to our intangible assets  we anticipate amortization expense will be  in other income decreased to  in from  in mainly due to lower interest rates 
in  other income fell due to lower cash and investment balances  lower interest rates and interest expense on debt incurred for the eis asset purchase 
income before income taxes for the autoscope segment decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was mainly due to lower revenues in the segment 
income before income taxes for the rtms segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher revenues in the segment  which were partially offset by increased expenses  a majority of which were caused by the us dollar weakening over the course of against the canadian dollar 
our income tax effective rate was in compared to in the effective rate was positively impacted by the realization of  in foreign tax credits whose status was uncertain prior to we expect the effective rate in to be below 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in royalty income reflected the continued success of econolite s distribution of autoscope in the north american market 
north american sales  which are sales of rtms in north america  were million in international sales  which include both autoscope and rtms sales outside of north america  increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in international sales was mainly due to the addition of rtms but also reflected market gains for autoscope 
we acquired the rtms family of products in december gross margins for international sales increased to in from in the increase resulted mainly from the addition of rtms  which typically earns higher margins than autoscope  and to a lesser extent from a revenue mix shift to higher margin product in autoscope 
gross margins on royalty income remained consistent at in and selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the change related mostly to the addition of rtms related expenses and to a lesser extent to headcount additions in sales and product support 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase in costs resulted mainly from the addition of rtms related expenses and increased professional services expenses  including the costs of our withdrawn follow on offering 
research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was directly related to the addition of rtms related expenses and headcount additions towards the end of the year 
amortization of intangibles expense was  in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eis asset purchase 
other income decreased to  in from  in in  other income fell due to lower cash and investment balances  lower interest rates and interest expense on debt incurred for the eis asset purchase 
in  other income was mainly tax exempt interest income  which was partially offset by interest expense on bank debt incurred in december our income tax effective rate was in our income tax effective rate was not meaningful due to the significant in process research and development expense impact on pre tax book income coupled with federal tax credits that brought our position to a benefit 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments at december  our investments held at december  were auction rate securities that were redeemed at par in january net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in as compared to  our lower net income and increased inventory balances were offset by decreased accounts receivable outstanding 
the primary reasons for the change compared to were the incremental net income increase in  significant increases in depreciation and amortization  and stabilization of working capital because of the eis asset purchase 
in  investment balances were similar to those of we purchased million in investments  net of redemptions  in as opposed to selling million in investments  net of purchases  in we anticipate that average receivable collection days in will be similar to and that it will not have a material impact on our liquidity 
our planned additions of property and equipment are discretionary  and we do not expect them to exceed historical levels in in december  we entered into a term loan agreement for million with associated bank  national association  or associated bank 
the interest rate for the term loan is based on a formula of libor plus current rate is 
the term loan has million outstanding and contains a call provision that would require us to repay the note in full in may if we do not meet certain covenants 
we previously had a separate million term note with associated bank that originated in may and was fully repaid in february we also have a revolving line of credit agreement with associated bank 
the revolving line of credit provides for up to million at an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus  as reset from time to time by the bank 
advances on the line of credit cannot exceed a borrowing base determined under a formula  which is a percentage of the amounts of eligible receivables 
the line of credit currently has no borrowings outstanding and matures on may  we believe  on an ongoing basis  we will have regular availability to draw a minimum of million on our line of credit based on our qualifying assets 
in conjunction with our eis asset purchase  the sellers have an earn out arrangement over approximately three years from the december date of purchase 
the earn out is based on earnings before taxes from rtms sales less related cost of revenue and operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and interest expenses  and it is calculated annually 
if the earnings are at target levels  the sellers would receive million annually  or million in total 
superior performance of the assets could lead to an earn out in excess of million  as the earn out is not capped 
earn out payments generally are due within three months of the end of an earn out period 
the first earn out period ran from december  to december  based on the results for rtms for the first earn out period  which ended december   the sellers of the eis assets were entitled to receive a million earn out payment  which was paid in march and april based on results for rtms  the sellers are entitled to a million earn out for the second earn out period  which ran from january  to december  the earn out is expected to be paid in march  with the liability recorded on our balance sheet as of december  if we are acquired or sell substantially all of our assets before december   we must pay eis million less earn out amounts previously paid as an acceleration of potential earn out payments under the eis asset purchase agreement 
eis was named in a us lawsuit in for infringement of a patent 
this lawsuit was dismissed upon appeal in august and is no longer contested by the plaintiff 
we incurred no expense over the life of the lawsuit  as eis was responsible for costs of defense 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   along with the availability of funds under our million revolving line of credit and cash provided by operating activities  will satisfy our projected working capital needs  payments under the eis earn out  investing activities  and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with an unconsolidated entity  including special purpose and similar entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
our goodwill related to our flow traffic subsidiary is tested for impairment on december of each year 
eis asset purchase rtms related goodwill is tested on october of each year 
on an annual basis  we reconcile our market value to the estimated combined fair value of our business segments and reporting units as a separate measure to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
for flow traffic  we estimate the fair value by using a combination of the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of flow traffic  and the comparable market transactions method 
the future economic benefits are significantly dependent on sustaining revenue levels for all product lines 
for the rtms reporting units  we estimate fair value by using a combination of the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from the rtms product line  and the market valuation approach  where the business was compared to guideline public company price earning multiples with a significant weighting to companies in the traffic detection business 
the future economic benefits are mainly dependent on future revenue growth of the rtms product line 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december   and if flow traffic and or the rtms reporting units do not provide the future economic benefits we project  the fair value of these assets may become impaired  and we would need to record an impairment loss 
intangible assets are stated at their estimated value at the time of acquisition 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over a five to eight year period for financial reporting purposes based on their estimated useful lives 
earn outs related to the eis asset purchase are recorded as additional goodwill in the year earned 
intangible assets are related to the eis asset purchase for trade names and technology and are amortized over their anticipated useful lives of five to eight years 
revenue recognition 
royalty income is recognized based upon a monthly royalty report provided to us by econolite 
this report is prepared by econolite based on its sales of products we developed and is based on sales delivered and accepted by its customers 
we recognize revenue from north american and international sales at the time of delivery and acceptance  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record provisions against sales revenue for estimated returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded based upon historical sales returns and changes in end user demands 
sales returns and warranty allowances are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance as deemed necessary based on our estimate of our future sources of taxable income and the expected timing of temporary difference reversals 
uncertain tax positions are recognized if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market and allowances have been made for obsolete  excess or unmarketable inventories based on estimated future usage or actual or anticipated product line changes 
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective september   we adopted accounting standards codification asc  making the asc of the financial accounting standards board fasb the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature not included in the asc is non authoritative 
the codification did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued asc  business combinations 
asc significantly changed the accounting for business combinations 
under asc  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
asc will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items 
asc also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
asc applies to us prospectively for business combinations beginning in  and this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asc  consolidation 
asc establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
asc also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
asc is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended asc  consolidation  to improve how enterprises disclose their involvement with variable interest entities vie  which are special purpose entities  and other entities whose equity at risk is insufficient or lacks certain characteristics 
among other things  asc changes how an entity determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie and whether that vie should be consolidated 
asc requires an entity to provide significantly more disclosures about its involvement with a vie 
companies must comprehensively review involvements with potential vies  including those previously considered to be qualifying special purpose entities  to determine the effect on their consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
asc is effective prospectively for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this portion of asc will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into currency hedges to attempt to lower our exposure to translation gains and losses as well as to limit the impact of foreign currency translation upon the consolidation of our foreign subsidiaries 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates  if we have not hedged  could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
our current greatest exposure for a negative material impact to our operations is a rising canadian dollar versus the us dollar
