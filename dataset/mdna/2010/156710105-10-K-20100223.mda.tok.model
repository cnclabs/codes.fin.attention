segment revenues in millions year ended december  advanced ceramic operations esk ceramics semicon associates thermo materials ceradyne canada boron inter segment elimination total revenue from external customers segment income before provision for taxes in millions year ended december  advanced ceramic operations esk ceramics semicon associates thermo materials ceradyne canada boron inter segment elimination total segment income before provision for taxes we categorize our products into four market applications 
the table below shows the percentage contribution of our total sales to external customers of each market application in the different time periods 
year ended december  defense industrial automotive diesel commercial total the principal factor contributing to our growth in sales from through was demand by the us military for ceramic body armor that protects soldiers  which was primarily the result of military conflicts such as those in iraq and afghanistan 
this demand was driven by recognition of the performance and life saving benefits of utilizing advanced technical ceramics in lightweight body armor 
our sales also increased from through because of our acquisition of esk ceramics in august  our acquisition of minco  inc in july  our acquisition of eaglepicher boron  llc in august  which we renamed boron products  llc  and the recent expansion of our operations into china 
our sales declined in primarily because of reduction in shipments of body armor 
our sales declined in primarily because of a continued reduction in shipments of body armor and also due to a reduction in shipments of our industrial products because of the severe economic recession 
shipments of lightweight ceramic body armor represented million or of our total revenues in  million or of our total revenues in  and million or of our total revenues in of these amounts  esapi enhanced small arms protective inserts body armor represented of our total body armor shipments in  of our total body armor shipments in  and of our total body armor shipments in shipments of xsapi  the newest ballistic threat generation of ceramic body armor plates  represented million  or of our total revenues and of our total body armor shipments in these shipments were made against an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract awarded to us in october this five year contract has a maximum value of billion and allows the us government to order either xsapi or esapi body armor from us 
to date  we have received one delivery order under this contract in march for million of xsapi body armor 
we anticipate shipping the remaining balance of this order  million  during the first quarter of since it is our policy to include in backlog only delivery orders with firm delivery dates  our backlog at december  does not include any amounts under this id iq contract except for the balance of the initial delivery order 
based on informal discussions with us army personnel  we believe the us army has decided that the current xsapi weight from all suppliers  although in compliance with the weight limitations specified in the id iq contract  is too heavy for use in the current military campaign in afghanistan 
consequently  unless the us army changes its position regarding weight or the ballistic threat that the xsapi plate defeats becomes more prevalent  we do not expect any additional orders for the current version of xsapi ceramic body armor plates 
we are developing esapi and xsapi designs that weigh to less than the current designs and will offer these to the us army and other department of defense users once these designs meet the current ballistic requirements 
there is no assurance that we will be successful with these lighter weight designs 
we do have qualified lightweight body armor inserts that are viable for the afghanistan campaign and these designs have been offered to the army and the marines 
these designs offer significant weight saving at a reduced level of protection from the currently fielded esapi design 
the army and the marines have shown interest in these designs and we continue to pursue these opportunities  but there is no assurance that we will be successful 
we believe there will continue to be a viable replacement business for body armor inserts that is procured through the defense supply center philadelphia dscp  and ceradyne expects continued procurements for replacement inserts during we will also continue to bid on foreign military sales fms for the first generation of inserts called small arms protective inserts sapi through our existing id iq contract with aberdeen proving grounds 
although we believe that demand for ceramic body armor will continue for many years  the quantity and timing of government orders depends on a number of factors outside of our control  such as the amount of us defense budget appropriations and the level of international conflicts 
moreover  ceramic armor contracts generally are awarded in an open competitive bidding process and may be cancelled by the us government at any time without penalty 
therefore  our future level of sales of ceramic body armor will depend on the us military s continued demand for these products and our ability to successfully compete for and retain this business 
our order backlog was million as of december  and million as of december  orders for ceramic armor represented approximately million  or of the total backlog as of december  and million  or of the total backlog as of december  we expect that substantially all of our order backlog as of december  will be shipped during based on our current backlog for ceramic body armor and on the other factors discussed above  we expect our shipments of ceramic body armor to be lower in fiscal year than in our sales to customers located outside of the united states have varied in recent years  representing million  or of net sales in  million  or of net sales in  and million  or of net sales in we currently have sales offices in germany  china  england and canada as well as commissioned independent sales representatives in other parts of europe and asia 
of our sales to customers located outside the united states  were denominated in us dollars during net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of revenues from the sale of products  which we recognize when an agreement of sale exists  the product has been delivered according to the terms of the sales order and collection is reasonably assured 
we may reduce revenue with reserves for sales returns 
allowances for sales returns  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  are based upon historical sales returns 
we did not include a sales return provision at december  or because our historical experience with sales returns leads us to conclude that no allowance for sales returns is necessary 
we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
our business requires us to maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  our gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
additionally  because many of our products are customized  we are frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses associated with production efforts  which we also include in cost of product sales 
the cost of electricity comprises a significant portion of our cost of product sales 
our high electricity utilization is a direct result of the use of high temperature furnaces to hot press ceramic body armor inserts and to sinter silicon nitride sin for industrial products 
several years ago  we recognized the need to mitigate the cost of electricity and in we embarked on a plan to move production from california to lexington  kentucky 
to date  we have moved all of our sin furnaces to kentucky and have established three new hot press lines in kentucky 
no large scale furnaces have been added to the california facility in the past two years 
the electricity cost in kentucky is more stable than california because of the presence of coal fired power plants 
ceradyne may continue the shift of more production to kentucky by moving further hot press production from california to kentucky in the future 
the price of electricity in kentucky has been stable for the past three years and is projected by our supplier to continue to be stable over the next few years 
we have a policy of locating new production facilities that require high levels of electricity in regions of the world that have either available hydroelectric or coal fired power plants 
the cost of electricity for our manufacturing operations in the united states and europe was approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  and approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in over the last several years  the cost of electricity from utility companies has increased  particularly in california where a significant portion of our manufacturing facilities are located 
management utilizes utility industry specialists and consultants to help manage and implement strategies to minimize annual energy price increases at our advanced ceramic operations california facilities 
for other locations in the united states and germany  management s strategy is to enter into long term contracts to obtain fixed price increases in order to increase its ability to accurately forecast future energy costs and ensure a stable cost structure 
fluctuations in the cost of electricity affect our ability to accurately forecast future energy costs and consequently our profitability 
if the cost of electricity were to increase substantially  our gross profit margins may decline 
with regard to significant costs for raw materials that impact our gross margins  we rely on two critical materials to make ceramic body armor boron carbide powder  which is the principal raw material used in the production of ceramic armor plates  and an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene textile material  which we laminate to the surface of the ceramic armor plates 
we obtain substantially all of our boron carbide powder from our subsidiary  esk ceramics  which has been a supplier of boron carbide powder to us for over years 
boron carbide is made from borax and boric acid through a complicated furnace process 
historically  these raw material products have not experienced significant price and supply instability and consequently we have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of boron carbide material from esk ceramics 
we have further identified a second source of boron carbide from a supplier that utilizes crude boron carbide from china and does the finishing in the united states 
the crude boron carbide from china is inexpensive and offers a method to mitigate any internal cost increases at esk ceramics through the use of lower cost china material as part of the esk ceramics raw material mix 
selling expenses 
our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for direct sales and marketing employees  commissions for direct sales employees and for independent sales representatives  trade show expenses  rent for our sales offices  product literature  and travel and entertainment expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  employee bonuses  which are computed quarterly and accrued in the quarter earned  professional service fees  rent for facilities and expenses for information technology 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  materials and supplies related to ongoing application engineering in response to customer requirements for future products  and the research and development of new materials technology and products 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
change in accounting for convertible debt in may  the fasb staff issued new accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial settlement which specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the company adopted this new guidance as of january   and the adoption impacted the historical accounting for our senior subordinated convertible notes due december  the notes 
the implementation of this new accounting guidance for convertible debt resulted in the following retrospective changes in long term debt  debt issuance costs included in other noncurrent assets  deferred tax liability  additional paid in capital and retained earnings in thousands net increase decrease long term debt debt issuance costs deferred tax liability additional paid in capital retained earnings allocation of long term debt proceeds and issuance costs to equity component on issuance date cumulative retrospective impact from amortization of discount on liability component and debt issuance costs cumulative retrospective impact at january  retrospective impact from amortization of discount on liability component and debt issuance costs during the year cumulative retrospective impact at december  retrospective impact from amortization of discount on liability component and debt issuance costs during the year cumulative retrospective impact at december  the adoption of the new accounting guidance also resulted in increased interest expense of approximately million in and million in  and decreased net income by million in and million in the retrospective impact to earnings per share was a decrease of in and in as a result of the adoption of the accounting guidance for convertible debt  interest expense for the year ended december  includes non cash interest expense from amortization of the discount on the liability component of million and amortization of debt issuance costs of  which reduced net income by million and earnings per share by 
as of december  and  the long term debt and the equity component recorded in additional paid in capital  net of income tax benefit  determined in accordance with the new accounting guidance for convertible debt  comprised the following in thousands december  december  long term debt principal amount unamortized discount net carrying amount equity component  net of income tax benefit the discount on the liability component of long term debt is being amortized using the effective interest method based on an annual effective rate of  which represented the market interest rate for similar debt without a conversion option on the issuance date  through december  which coincides with the first date that holders of the notes can exercise their put option  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing at page f of this report 
the amount of interest expense recognized relating to both the contractual interest coupon and the amortization of the discount on the liability component was million in  million in and million in results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items from our financial statements for the years ended december   and expressed as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative acquisition related charges research and development restructuring plant closure and severance goodwill impairment income from operations other income expense income before provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the main causes of the decrease were a reduction in body armor shipments and a reduction in sales at our esk ceramics subsidiary due to the recent economic contraction 
overall  net sales for the year ended december  of our defense related products were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year and sales for the year ended december  of industrial products amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year and our net sales of commercial products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the contraction of the global economy was a major reason for the decline in our sales volume and resulting gross profit in our industrial  automotive diesel and commercial business lines 
also  contributing to the decline was a decrease in per unit sales prices of crucibles due to increased price competition 
our advanced ceramic operations division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the primary reason for this decrease was that shipments of ceramic body and other armor components for defense customers amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from million of net sales in the prior year 
the primary reason for the decline in shipments was a reduction in demand for esapi body armor sets from us by the us army because they achieved their targeted goal of  total sets of esapi received from all suppliers since this targeted goal of shipments was met at the end of september we received our first and only production order to date for the newest ballistic threat generation of body armor  xsapi  plates on march  for million under the id iq contract discussed above under overview  and commenced shipments during april net sales of xsapi body armor for the three and twelve month periods ended december  were million and million  respectively 
other decreases in sales were from reductions in sales of combat vehicle armor of million 
also contributing to the decrease in sales was a million decline in shipments of automotive diesel products due primarily to the reduction in production of the heavy duty diesel trucks which was negatively affected by trucking companies inability to secure financing to purchase new trucks with the result that some of our customers initiated reduced work hours to reduce production because of the decline in sales in the transportation industry as a result of the severe economic contraction during in addition  sales of industrial wear products declined by million in  also due to the severe economic contraction 
sales to the automotive diesel market represented of sales for the year ended december  and of sales for the year ended december  the recent events in the automotive industry have not had a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity 
we have not experienced any modifications to payment terms due to issues involving customer liquidity in this industry segment 
our esk ceramics subsidiary had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
we computed sales on a constant currency basis by calculating sales in actual euros and applying a monthly average foreign exchange rate of the euro to the us dollar during  which was then compared to actual sales in u 
s dollars 
sales of industrial products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decreases in sales for industrial and automotive diesel products were primarily the result of the severe economic contraction during sales of defense products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
included in sales of defense products for the year ended december  were inter segment sales of million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million of shipments to our advanced ceramic operations division 
the balance of the decrease was due to a reduction in sales of boron carbide powder to third parties in the defense industry for the year ended december   because their sales of ceramic body armor declined 
our semicon associates division net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decrease reflects lower shipments of microwave cathodes 
our thermo materials division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the primary reasons for this decrease were a reduction of million in the sales of precision investment casting products and a million reduction in refractory product sales  both due to the severe economic recession 
revenue from crucibles used in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
this decrease was caused by lower per unit sales prices due to increased price competition while units sold increased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
sales to the defense industry during the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million when compared to the prior year 
our ceradyne canada subsidiary had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
to lower our costs of production  during the year ended december   we began to manufacture our boral product line internally 
this caused a delay in production  resulting in a decline in net sales of million during the year ended december  our boron segment  which includes our ceradyne boron products subsidiary  which we acquired on august   and our semequip  inc subsidiary  which we acquired on august  had net sales for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales for the year ended december  from ceradyne boron products were million  an increase of million  or  from million during the prior year 
the increased sales by ceradyne boron products resulted from additional shipments to the nuclear industry of million and were offset by a decline in sales to the semiconductor industry of  semequip s sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million during the prior year 
the increased sales by semequip  inc were the result of additional shipments of spare parts and an increase in engineering services  both to the semiconductor industry 
additionally  financial results included a full year of semequip s results compared to less than five months of results in as semequip was acquired in august gross profit 
our gross profit for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
this decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  caused primarily by substantially lower sales of body armor  particularly of higher margin sales of body armor and reduced operating leverage resulting in less absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses in the production of body armor 
our body armor product line was responsible for million of the total decrease in gross profit in compared to also contributing to the decline in gross profits were lower sales and production volumes of most of our industrial product lines caused by reduced demand brought on by the recent sharp economic contraction  resulting in an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses 
however  we did realize increases in gross profit of million from a growth in sales to the nuclear industry  million from expanding sales of products to the semiconductor industry  both by our ceradyne boron products subsidiary  and million from improvement in sales of ceramic radomes to the defense industry by our thermo materials division 
our advanced ceramic operations division posted gross profit for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales were lower volumes of production of body armor and industrial products resulting in an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses  higher scrap rates incurred in the production of body armor  and poorer sales mix caused by shipments of lower gross margin sapi and xsapi body armor products compared to the prior year 
our esk ceramics subsidiary had a gross profit for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in the year ended december  compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales were the result of an unfavorable sales mix due to lower sales of ceramic powder for armor applications  an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses caused by lower production volumes  and lower sales of all product lines due to reduced demand for our products as a result of the recent economic contraction 
gross profit was also adversely impacted by the million of charges for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in connection with the closing of the facility in bazet  france 
additional information regarding this plant closure is provided below under the caption restructuring plant closure and severance 
our semicon associates division had gross profit for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit and in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was due primarily to decreased sales of higher margin parts from our microwave cathode product line compared to the prior year 
our thermo materials division had gross profit for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the primary reason gross profit decreased was due to lower unit sales prices of crucibles due to increased price competition  while costs did not decline proportionately 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit was lower sales of industrial and refractory products due to the recent world wide economic contraction resulting in an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses compared to the prior year 
our ceradyne canada subsidiary had negative gross profit for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  from a gross profit of million in the prior year 
the negative gross profit resulted primarily from significantly lower sales of our boral product line and metal matrix composite products to the nuclear industry resulting in under utilized capacity and an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses compared to the prior year 
our ceradyne boron segment  which includes our ceradyne boron products subsidiary  which we acquired on august   and our semequip  inc subsidiary  which we acquired on august   had gross profit of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
of this increase in gross margin  million was from additional sales of products to the nuclear and semiconductor industries and improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
offsetting this increase at ceradyne boron products was an increase of million in negative gross profit from semequip  inc to a negative million gross profit in the year ending december  from a negative million in the prior year primarily due to the reporting of a full year of semequip s results in compared to less than five months of results in selling expenses 
our selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
selling expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in selling expenses was due to a reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses 
the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to a reduction in net sales that was not fully offset by a proportionate decrease in selling expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to a reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses  and reduced bonuses due to lower pre tax income in as compared to the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to a reduction in net sales that was not fully offset by a proportionate decrease in general and administrative expenses 
restructuring plant closure and severance 
we recorded pre tax restructuring and severance charges of million for the year ended december  included in this amount are charges totaling million due to the closing of our manufacturing facility in bazet  france owned by our esk ceramics france subsidiary and million of severance charges consisting of headcount reductions in the united states of million and million in germany during the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we made a strategic decision to close this manufacturing plant 
during the year ended december   we recognized pre tax charges of million for the closure of the bazet facility which included severance and related costs  and contract termination costs of million  and legal and other closure costs of million 
we also incurred million for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that is reported in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  the severance charge was recognized as a postemployment benefit as the company s obligation related to employees rights to receive compensation for future absences was attributable to employees services already rendered  the obligation relates to rights that legally vest  payment of the compensation is probable  and the amount could be reasonably estimated based on local statutory requirements 
we made this decision as a cost cutting measure to eliminate losses that were incurred at this facility due to the recent severe economic contraction 
this decision is consistent with our ongoing objective to lower the costs of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  esk ceramics france reduced its workforce by approximately employees  primarily composed of manufacturing  production and additional support staff at the plant 
affected employees were eligible for a severance package that includes severance pay  continuation of benefits and outplacement services 
the plant was completely closed by the end of calendar year and we anticipate closing the sale of the building during the first half of goodwill impairment 
we are required to test annually whether the estimated fair value of our reporting units is sufficient to support the goodwill assigned to those reporting units  we perform the annual test in the fourth quarter 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment before the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
at december   our market capitalization was less than our total stockholders equity 
we consider this decline to be temporary and based on general economic conditions therefore no interim test of goodwill is required 
as of december   none of our reporting units were at risk of failing step one of the impairment test 
we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of for the goodwill associated with our ceradyne canada operating segment 
we determined that the demand for our boral product line  which was a large part of the revenue of the ceradyne canada operating and reporting unit  continued to decline and that this condition required a goodwill impairment test before the annual test for this reporting unit 
to complete the test for impairment  we utilized discounted cash flow methodology  which requires the forecasting of cash flows and requires the selection of discount rates 
we used available information to make these fair value estimates  including discount rates  commensurate with the risks relevant to our business 
based on the goodwill impairment test performed on the ceradyne canada reporting unit  we recorded a million impairment charge  which was recognized in the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we also conducted a test on the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to determine whether there was impairment on our long lived assets in our ceradyne canada reporting unit 
based on the analysis of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows for this reporting unit  we determined that there was no impairment of the long lived assets for the ceradyne canada reporting unit 
the valuation methodologies and the underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance  terminal growth rate and the selection of an appropriate discount rate used to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
the long term projections used in the valuation were developed as a part of our annual budgeting and forecasting process 
the discount rate used in the valuation was selected based upon an analysis of comparable companies and included adjustments made to account for our specific attributes such as size and industry 
the test for long lived asset impairment resulted in no impairment of those assets at december  additionally  the test for goodwill impairment resulted in no impairment of goodwill at december  at the time of the completion of our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   we believed that the cash flow projections we used in determining fair value already appropriately reflected our revised forecast of our financial performance for while the reduction in sales volume to the us government and the recent severe economic downturn has impacted all of our reporting units  we believe that the fundamentals of our businesses remain solid and the long term outlook for our industry remains strong 
our valuation models assume the restoration of long term market stability after a near term period of no growth 
all reporting units had fair values which exceeded carrying values by at least as of december  additionally  a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which a minor change can have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
acquisition related charge 
we incurred an acquisition related compensation charge of million for the year ended december  associated with a pre closing commitment by semequip  inc for incentive compensation for several of its employees and advisors 
this million charge included million of cash paid by ceradyne at closing  and the balance represents the discounted present value of the portion of the estimated contingent consideration payable as incentive compensation to these employees and advisors over years 
during the third quarter of  we revised the estimated future sales and earnings of semequip  which caused a million reduction in this acquisition liability and a credit to pre tax earnings for the year ended december  research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decrease in research and development expenses were the reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to a reduction in net sales that was not fully offset by a proportionate decrease in research and development expenses 
other income expense 
our net other income and expense for the year ended december  was a net expense of million  an increase of million  or  from million of other net expense in the prior year 
this increase was primarily caused by a reduction of million in interest income on our cash balances and short term marketable securities because of a substantial decline in interest rates in this was offset by a reduction of million of losses on auction rate securities compared to the losses incurred in and a gain on an early extinguishment of debt of million

we anticipate that semequip will continue to incur operating losses for the next two fiscal years 
additionally  our boron products subsidiary incurred a loss before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million due to a reduction of sales of high margin products to the semiconductor industry as a result of a business contraction in that industry and poor manufacturing yields 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year resulted from a higher proportion of our pre tax income originating from our operations in china where we did not pay income tax 
income taxes also decreased because pre tax income was lower in compared to liquidity and capital resources we generally have met our operating and capital requirements with cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock 
the following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the two years ended december  and in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments accounts receivable  net inventories  net working capital annual operating cash flow during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million for the year ended december  the million of cash flow from operations during is primarily comprised of net income totaling million  with million of non cash charges included therein  and a reduction in net operating assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired  of million  mostly due to lower revenues during the year 
we invested million to expand manufacturing capacity in selected product lines and million to acquire the assets and business of diaphorm technologies llc  as explained more fully elsewhere 
we also used million to buy back our stock and million to acquire a portion of our outstanding convertible debt  as described more fully below 
in an effort to increase yield  as of december  we had invested a net additional million in marketable securities as compared to the end of as a result  our net cash at december  declined by million as compared to a million increase during the year ended december  investing activities consumed million of cash during the year ended december  this included million for the acquisition of substantially all of the business and assets and all technology and intellectual property related to ballistic combat and non combat helmets of diaphorm technologies  llc  based in salem  new hampshire 
we invested million for the purchase of marketable securities as we extended the maturities of our investments in an attempt to increase our return 
we also spent million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
included in this amount is million for improvements in the production of ceramic crucibles at our china and atlanta facilities and million for the ongoing implementation of our sap software system

the negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december  was due to our investment in our german subsidiary  esk ceramics  and in our chinese subsidiary  ceradyne tianjin technical ceramics  ltd 
our net cash position increased by million during the year ended december   compared to a million increase during the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to million 
the primary factors contributing to cash flow from operating activities in the year ended december   were net income of million  and adjustments of non cash amounts related to depreciation and amortization of million  stock compensation of million  and million of unrealized losses on auction rate securities

these contributions to our cash flow from operating activities were offset in part by deferred income taxes of million  increased levels of inventories of million  an increase of million in prepaid expenses due to an increase in tax deposits  and decreases of million in accounts payable  million in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
higher levels of inventories were largely caused by a increase in raw materials and finished goods inventory in connection with the expansion of our ceramic crucible business in china and in the united states  an increase of million at our boron segment and an increase of million in inventory at our esk subsidiary 
esk experienced rapidly declining sales in the fourth quarter of and due to long lead times in their production cycle could not reduce their inventory levels quick enough to offset the decline in sales during the quarter 
these increases in inventory levels were partially offset by a decrease of million in inventories at our aco division because of a reduction in sales in decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were caused by lower levels of business activity at our aco division 
income taxes payable decreased because of lower levels of pre tax net income in compared to investing activities consumed million of our cash for the year ended december  this included million for acquisitions  comprising million net of million cash received for the acquisition of semequip  inc and million for the acquisition certain assets and developed technology related to proprietary technical ceramic bearing patents and intellectual property

these expenditures were partially offset by million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
financing activities during the year ended december  consumed net cash of million 
during the year  we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million under a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash available from the sale of short term investments  cash available from borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
our anticipated capital requirements for primarily relate to normal replacements of equipment and the planned expansion of our manufacturing facilities in china that will cost approximately million in total of which we expect to spend approximately million will be spent in to finance the expansion in china  we plan to use cash that we expect our china operations to generate during  we will use approximately million of our existing cash balances held in our bank accounts in china  and the balance will be funded from our existing cash balances in the united states

we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding settlement of these uncertain tax positions  and as a result  they have been excluded from the table 
off balance sheet arrangements the only off balance sheet arrangement is the conversion feature of our convertible senior subordinated notes discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which begin on page f of this report 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any temporary or other than temporary impairment of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses the assistance of outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
sales recognition 
sales are recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  the product has been delivered according to the terms of the sales order and collection is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we may reduce revenue with reserves for sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  are based upon historical sales returns 
we did not include a sales return provision at december  or because our historical experience with sales returns leads us to conclude that no allowance for sales returns is necessary 
we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
accounts receivable 
we review our trade accounts receivables and our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due based on contractual terms 
a write off will occur if the settlement of the account receivable is less than the carrying amount or we ultimately determine the balance will not be collected 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the financial statements included in this report beginning on page f inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on our estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  we rely on our knowledge of the industry as well as our current inventory levels 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
accounting for long lived assets 
long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flow over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flow discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other assets and liabilities 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is not being amortized  but instead is subject to an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill as of the fiscal year end in the fourth quarter of each year 
goodwill is allocated to six reporting units  which represent the company s operating segments 
the company has defined its reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level 
the company s reporting units are advanced ceramic operations  semicon associates  thermo materials  esk ceramics  ceradyne canada and boron 
the company compares the fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value 
fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows and market multiples for each business unit with significant goodwill 
we compared each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the use of discounted cash flows requires that we make various economic  market and business assumptions in developing our internal forecasts  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital that reflect our best estimates when performing the annual impairment test 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable 
however  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change in the future which may then cause us to later conclude that an impairment exists  or with hindsight  it may appear that we could have understated the extent of impairment based on new information that was unknown at the prior testing date 
we may incur a goodwill impairment charge in the future  if for example  the market price of our stock materially declines  if the financial results of our operations deteriorate or other circumstances require an impairment charge 
at december   the company s market capitalization was below its net book value 
based on a control factor that was considered and the discounted cash flows used in management s assessment  an impairment to goodwill was not warranted at december  intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the economic consumption method 
pension 
the company provides pension benefits to its employees of its subsidiaries of esk ceramics and ceradyne boron products 
for the pension plans of both subsidiaries  we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
these key assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plans 
this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
a hypothetical basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on assets would change pension expense by  the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due 
a hypothetical basis point change in the discount rate would change the pension obligation by approximately million 
the impact on pension expense from a hypothetical basis point change in the discount rate would not be material 
in addition the expense and liabilities of the plan were determined using other assumptions for future experience  such as mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated  which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense

the company adopted this new guidance on january   which did not have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb staff issued new accounting guidance which the company adopted on april   as follows i 
guidance for making fair value measurements more consistent with existing gaap 
this new guidance provides additional authoritative principles in determining whether a market is active or inactive  and whether a transaction is distressed 
this guidance is applicable to all assets and liabilities ie financial and nonfinancial and will require enhanced disclosures 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
ii 
companies are required to provide greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an other than temporary impairment event and to improve presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments in the financial statements 
the impact of the adoption of this new guidance is discussed in note iii 
this guidance requires new disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements 
the company has adopted this new guidance and has provided the additional disclosures required as discussed in note in may  the fasb issued new guidance which establishes general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are available to be issued subsequent events 
more specifically  this new guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition in the financial statements  identifies the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date 
this new guidance provides largely the same framework for the evaluation of subsequent events which previously existed only in auditing literature 
the company has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through february   which is the day the financial statements were issued 
in august  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance regarding the measurement of liabilities at fair value which provides clarification that in circumstances where a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  a reporting entity must measure fair value of the liability using one of the following techniques the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or another valuation technique  such as a present value technique or the amount that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability 
this statement becomes effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance  which 
the company adopted this new guidance on october   which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than two years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
our long term investments at december   included million of auction rate securities  net of a pre tax temporary impairment charge of million against accumulated other comprehensive income and a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge of million against earnings and a million charge for realized losses 
the company s investments in auction rate securities represent interests in insurance securitizations collateralized by pools of residential and commercial mortgages  asset backed securities and other structured credits relating to the credit risk of various bond guarantors that mature at various dates from june through july these auction rate securities were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process which is scheduled every days  that resets the applicable interest rate  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
interest rates are capped at a floating rate of one month libor plus additional spread ranging from to depending on prevailing rating 
during the second half of the year  through and through december   the auctions for these securities failed 
as a result of current negative conditions in the global credit markets  auctions for our investment in these securities are inactive 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid through the normal auction process and may be liquidated if a buyer is found outside the auction process 
although the auctions have failed and are currently inactive  the company continues to receive underlying cash flows in the form of interest income from the investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   the fair value of the company s investments in auction rate securities was below cost by approximately million 
the fair value of the auction rate securities has been below cost for more than two years 
with respect to our investments in auction rate securities as of december  and december   we categorized the investments into three main categories for analytical purposes which comprised insurance wrapped securities  put right securities and credit derivative product company securities 
the insurance wrapped category comprised auction rate securities where the payments are guaranteed by an insurance company  such as a monoline financial guaranty insurance company 
the put right category comprised an auction rate security that was created to provide capital to the issuer in the event that the issuer exercised the put right 
the credit derivative product company category comprised auction rate securities where the issuer is a financial services company that offers credit risk protection of structured financial assets in the form of credit derivatives 
the auction rate securities issued by these financial services companies were created as a way to provide collateral for the issuers to use for entering into credit default swaps 
for the year ended december   as part of our evaluation as to whether the decline in fair value of the auction rate securities was other than temporary  where it was probable that the company would not collect all contractual cash flows and the remaining balance was not recoverable  we considered factors which included  but were not limited to  general market conditions  the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the securities  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
the new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
subsequent increases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income  subsequent decreases in fair value  if not an other than temporary impairment  are included in other comprehensive income 
also  due to the illiquid market for the auction rate securities and limited availability of public information on these securities  we engaged a third party investment banking firm to assist us in performing the valuation of the securities 
our valuation analysis used a trinomial discount model where the compilations of future cash flows were priced by summing the present values of the future principal and interest payments 
we then forecasted probabilities of default  auction failure  and a successful auction at par or repurchase at par for each period  as well as forecasted recovery rates in default for each of the securities 
finally  we discounted the weighted average cash flow for each period back to present value at the determined discount rate for each of the securities 
based on the information included in prospectuses and other data compiled for each of the auction rate securities for the year ended december   we determined that the decline in fair values of the put right securities and credit derivative product company securities categories were other than temporary 
this determination considered the terms of guarantees associated with the securities  the quality of the underlying collateral  external ratings and other relevant available market information compiled with the assistance of the third party investment banking firm 
quantitative data reviewed and analyzed by us also indicated that the cumulative probability of default at some point in the future was for the put right securities and more than for the credit derivative product company securities at the high end of the value range as of december  we believed it was probable that we would collect all contractual cash flows and the carrying value of the securities in the insurance wrapped category as of december  was determined to be recoverable based on the valuation of the securities which considered the terms of certain guarantees  quality of underlying collateral  external ratings and other relevant market information 
for the quarter ended june   we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb staff on the effective date of april  in accordance with the new guidance  when an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss 
based on our evaluation of the auction rate securities as of december   we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be required to sell the put right and credit derivative product company securities before recovery of our amortized cost  accordingly  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges for the decline in fair value during the year ended december  quantitative data compiled with the assistance of our third party investment banking firm also indicated the cumulative probability of default at some point in the future was for the put right securities and more than for the credit derivative product company securities at the high end of the value range as of december in addition to the above  during the year ended december   we also recognized an other than temporary impairment charge for the credit risk associated with the insurance wrapped securities 
in determining whether a credit loss existed  we used our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security 
we then discounted the expected cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition 
the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and amortized cost represented the impairment charge for credit risk 
we believe that the carrying value of the securities in the insurance wrapped category  after the adjustment for credit risk  as of december  was determined to be recoverable based on the valuation of the securities which considered the terms of certain guarantees  quality of underlying collateral  external ratings and other relevant market information 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfolio is days  therefore  the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have an impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative of historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on the weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately million at december  and approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investments of approximately million at december  and approximately  at december  actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuer of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classify short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are available for current operations 
we are not exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt as it is fixed rate debt 
consequently  we do not utilize interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments regarding our debt 
foreign currency fluctuations we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management team to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges 
we measure the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenues  costs and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income miscellaneous
