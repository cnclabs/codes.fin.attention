item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals  small and medium sized businesses  and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include commercial banking  investment banking  investment advisory and trust and insurance 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income 
we manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
our company has focused on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
the cost of this process relative to our size has been high 
in addition  we have operated with excess capacity during the start up phases of various projects due to our commitment to technology and expansion of our fee based businesses 
as a result  relatively high levels of noninterest expense have adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits comprised most of this overhead category 
however  we believe that our compensation levels have allowed us to recruit and retain a highly qualified management team capable of implementing our business strategies 
we believe our compensation policies  which include the granting of stock based compensation to many employees and the offering of an employee stock purchase plan  have highly motivated our employees and enhanced our ability to maintain customer loyalty and generate earnings 
for additional discussion on stock based compensation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
industry overview 
the us commercial banking industry has been significantly impacted in and by decreased values in real estate related assets  a downturn in the financial markets and a significant tightening in the credit market 
the weakened us housing market has caused the industry to realize significant losses on write downs of investment securities securitized by real estate and higher credit costs for write downs of loans issued for investment 
during  banks failed and went into receivership with the fdic 
in  banks went into receivership 
this compares to only bank failures in the years to statements made by the chairman of the federal reserve during the third quarter of indicated the recession may be coming to an end from a technical perspective  but the economy could be weak for some time 
the unemployment rate increased from in december to in september  the highest rate since june the high unemployment rate is one of the driving factors that could prolong a weak economy 
in the third quarter of  fdic insured commercial banks reported a combined net profit of billion  a significant improvement over the combined net loss of billion recorded in the second quarter of the third quarter annualized net charge offs for the industry set a record high at of loans 
this marked the third time in the past four quarters that the net charge off rate has reached a new high 
the industry continues to be challenged by weakening asset quality as evidenced by the increase in noncurrent loans during the third quarter of to an all time high 
through september   noncurrent loans have increased for consecutive quarters 
however  some positive signs were also registered in the third quarter 
while troubled loans increased  the rate of increase in noncurrent loans was the smallest in the past four quarters 
the overall market conditions led the federal open markets committee fomc to maintain the target federal funds rate at a range of to basis points since it was initially set in december 
table of contents company overview 
from december   the first complete fiscal year under the current management team  to december   our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of million to a diversified financial services holding company with bank locations  six fee based businesses and total assets of billion 
certain key metrics of our operating segments at or for the years ended december  and are as follows investment corporate commercial investment advisory support and banking banking trust insurance other consolidated in thousands  except per share data net loss diluted loss per common share total assets net income loss diluted earnings loss per common share total assets net income loss diluted earnings loss per common share total assets noted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational results for and the company recognized a million goodwill impairment charge in commercial banking lost per diluted share in  down from a contribution of in our commercial banking franchise recognized provision for loan losses of million in  compared to million in net charge offs for totaled million  compared to million for nonperforming assets also increased to million at the end of  from million at the end of the bank s ratio of allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans ended the year at  the highest ratio the bank has had at the end of a year in its history  and the allowance exceeds of nonperforming loans 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the increase in provision for loan loss expense was the primary driver in the decrease in net income for both the commercial banking segment and the company 
the company s land acquisition and development portfolio represented of total loans  but accounted for approximately of the provision for loan losses and of the gross charge offs 
investment banking lost per diluted share in  down from a loss in mergers and acquisition activity was muted in due to the adverse impact of severe macro economic conditions 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
investment advisory and trust lost per diluted share in  down from a loss of in while the major market indices rose during  the market growth did not fully recapture the losses realized in the decline in average market values in compared to continued to pressure top line revenue 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
insurance lost per diluted share in  down from a contribution of in the segment was adversely impacted by a decrease in wealth transfer cases  as clients conserved cash reserves due to the recession 
the company s p c revenues are generated as a 
table of contents percentage of its client s insurance premiums 
as client payrolls  revenues and business assets have shrunk due to economic conditions  premiums have also decreased 
thus  the company has realized lower revenues on a large part of its existing client base 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
corporate support and other lost per diluted share in  down from a loss of in the increase in the net loss per share was primarily due to the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends for a full year in the preferred stock was outstanding for less than a month in in addition  the segment recorded million in provision for loan loss expense for non performing assets transferred from the commercial bank 
during the third quarter of  the company successfully completed a common equity offering of million  net of expenses 
the company recognized losses of million in on valuation adjustments of other real estate owned and other than temporary impairments on investments 
the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was compared to in the company s total risk based capital ratio increased to at the end of from at the end of our commercial banking franchise recognized provision for loan losses of million in  compared to million in net charge offs for totaled million  compared to million for nonperforming assets also increased to million at the end of  from million at the end of the increase in provision for loan loss expense was the primary driver in the decrease in net income for both the commercial banking segment and the company 
a migration of loans to a more adversely graded credit category in  including charge offs  caused the increase in the provision for loan losses 
investment banking lost per diluted share in  down from a contribution in investment banking revenues are transactional in nature and  as a result  the segment s earnings can be more volatile 
investment advisory and trust lost per diluted share in  down from a neutral contribution in on december   the company acquired wagner  an investment advisor providing investment management services for high net worth individuals and families  foundations and non profit organizations 
top line revenue for the segment was positively impacted by the acquisition of wagner in offsetting the increase in revenue from the wagner acquisition was a decrease in revenue due to market attrition of assets under management 
with all major market indices falling in  this negatively impacted the segment since revenue is generated based on a percentage of assets under management 
insurance contributed per diluted share in  an increase from a loss per diluted share in on january   the company completed the acquisition of bda  a provider of commercial and personal p c insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to individuals and businesses in the az market 
the acquisition of bda at the beginning of positively impacted both top line revenue and net income for the segment 
the wealth transfer business is transactional by nature and fluctuates based on the number of life insurance policies closed during a year 
during  the segment nearly doubled the revenue on wealth transfer cases from the amount recognized in the wealth transfer business was negatively 
table of contents impacted in  when a higher than normal number of cases were rejected in underwriting due to unforeseen medical issues 
to a lesser extent  the segment was also impacted by the overall reduction in insurance premiums being realized throughout the commercial insurance industry 
corporate support and other had a decrease in its net loss and loss per share  primarily due to a decrease in interest rates that reduced our interest expense on our variable rate junior subordinated debentures 
this was partially offset by additional interest expense on the new issuance of subordinated notes payable  discussed below 
the company recognized losses of million in on valuation adjustments of other real estate owned and other than temporary impairments on investments 
in the third and fourth quarter  the company successfully raised million through a privately placed issuance of subordinated notes payable 
the subordinated notes payable qualify as tier capital and helped strengthen the company s capital position 
further strengthening the company s capital position  on december   the company became the first colorado based financial institution to receive a capital investment from the treasury under the cpp 
the company received million from the issuance of series b preferred stock that pays a cumulative dividend of for the first five years and thereafter 
the company s total risk based capital ratio increased to at the end of from at the end of bank 
the commercial bank segment  the cornerstone of our franchise  has been adversely impacted by the slowdown in the economy and the tightening in the credit markets over the past two years 
loans fell by and asset quality significantly worsened during the negative impact of asset quality not only effected the level of provision for loan losses  but also impacted net interest income as earning assets decreased 
fee based business lines 
the company s fee based business lines investment banking  insurance  and investment advisory and trust operated at a loss for on a combined basis 
the impairment of goodwill was the primary contributor to the combined net loss 
our ratio of noninterest income to total operating revenues also declined to for compared to in we believe that through the combination of our commercial banking franchise and our fee based businesses  we are uniquely situated to service our commercial clients throughout their business lifecycle 
we are able to help our customers grow by providing banking services from our bank franchise  capital planning from gmb  and employee and executive benefits packages from fdl 
we can assist in planning for the future with wealth transfer and business succession planning from fdl 
we are able to protect assets with p c insurance from cobiz insurance 
we can facilitate exit and retirement strategies with merger and acquisition services from gmb  and investment management services with acmg and wagner 
we are also able to preserve our customers wealth with trust and fiduciary services from cobiz trust  investment management services from acmg and wagner  and wealth transfer services from fdl 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment  see segment results discussed below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that 
table of contents affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that could occur  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibilty of loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we maintain a loan review program independent of the lending function that is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
it includes the monitoring of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans  preventing insider abuse  and timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
we also have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a non accrual loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable  and representing a loss that has been or will be charged off 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
loans above a certain dollar amount that are adversely graded are reported to the loan committee and the chief credit officer along with current financial information  a collateral analysis and an action plan 
individual loans that are deemed to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  receivables subsequent measurement 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits  on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy  we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
possible factors that may impact the allowance for loan losses include  but are not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards as well as collection  charge off and recovery practices  changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
refer to the analysis of allowance for loan and credit losses section under financial condition and provision and allowance for loan and credit losses section under results of operations below for further discussion on management s methodology 

table of contents other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
write downs to fair value at the time of transfer to oreo is charged to allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of oreo held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including our historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 
recoverability of goodwill asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  requires that we evaluate on an annual basis or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment whether any portion of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
the recoverability of goodwill is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and it is not necessary to continue to step two of the impairment process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  step two is performed  where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill 
implied goodwill is computed as a residual value after allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using market multiples of comparable entities  including recent transactions  or a combination of market multiples and a discounted cash flow methodology 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management assumption 
discounted cash flow valuation models utilize variables such as revenue growth rates  expense trends  discount rates and terminal values 
based upon an evaluation of key data and market factors  management selects from a range the specific variables to be incorporated into the valuation model 
we conducted interim evaluations of our reporting units at march  and september  due to triggering events in those quarters 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of all reporting units was less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment was deemed to exist 
a goodwill impairment of million was recorded in deferred taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance may be established 
we consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline  or if we project lower levels of future taxable income 
such a valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents share based payments on january   we adopted guidance now included in asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc  originally issued as sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
prior to the adoption of the guidance now included in asc  we applied the intrinsic value method for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb accounting for stock issued to employees  which was allowed by sfas as an alternative to the fair value method recommended by sfas asc requires that the cash retained as a result of the tax deductibility of employee share based awards be presented as a component of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
under asc  we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility  expected life and expected dividend rate of the options 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the amount of options issued that are expected to be forfeited 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under asc  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
fair value the company has adopted asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc originally issued as sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as it applies to financial assets and liabilities effective january  asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
fair value may be used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities such as available for sale securities and derivatives in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
similarly  fair value may be used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets or liabilities such as impaired loans 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  the company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions in accordance with asc to determine the instrument s fair value 
at december   million of total assets  consisting of million in available for sale securities and million in derivative instruments  represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
at december   million of total liabilities represented derivative instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisting of impaired loans represented million of total assets 
certain private label mbs valued using broker dealer quotes based on proprietary broker models  which are considered by the company an unobservable input level  totaled million of total assets at december  the company recognized million in other than temporary impairments on the private label mbs for the year ended december  for additional 
table of contents information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective

upon adoption  an entity is required to record a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized otti from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income if the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery

lending activities general 
we provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending services  including commercial loans  commercial and residential real estate construction loans  commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans  consumer loans  revolving lines of credit  and equipment lease financing 
our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium sized businesses with annual sales of million to million  and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of  to million 
at december   substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within colorado and arizona 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity  underwriting and servicing costs  principal amount  and extent of other banking relationships with the customer 
interest rates are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulations 
see net interest income for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans 
credit procedures and review 
we address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures  including underwriting criteria  officer and customer lending limits  a multi layered loan approval process for larger loans  periodic document examination  justification for any exceptions to credit policies  loan review and concentration monitoring 
in response to current conditions and heightened default risk due to depressed real estate and collateral values  management expanded the resources of the credit and loan review departments with the objective to identify problem credit situations earlier 
in addition  we provide ongoing loan officer training and review 
we have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems  assisted by a dedicated senior credit officer in each geographic market 
all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing  at least on a monthly basis  all past due loans in their respective portfolios 
in addition  each of the loan officers establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the boards of directors of the bank and cobiz 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review department that reports to the chief operations officer of the company and submits reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors and the credit administration department 
in response to the current credit cycle  declining asset quality and increasing foreclosures  the company made a significant investment in establishing a special assets group comprised of seasoned and talented specialists to efficiently manage nonperforming assets 
management believes having the specialized function will enable our bankers to continue to pursue new lending and deposit relationships and immediately address the company s troubled assets 
composition of loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated 

table of contents at december  in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other total loans less allowance for loan losses net loans held for investment loans held for sale net loans gross loans decreased by million to billion at december  the decline was driven by customer paydowns in each major category of the portfolio outpacing new loan demand and the increased level of charge offs 
loan generation slowed in as businesses de leveraged their balance sheets and accumulated cash reserves in response to economic factors 
the decrease in total loans was equally shared between the colorado and arizona markets 
gross loans increased by million in growth in the loan portfolio consisted of approximately million and million loans generated in our colorado and arizona markets  respectively 
the increase in the loan portfolio in was primarily due to growth of our commercial and industrial loans c i and term commercial mortgages 
under state law  the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to of our unimpaired capital  surplus  undivided profits and allowance for loan losses 
at december   our individual legal lending limit was million 
the bank s board of directors has established an internal lending limit of million for normal credit extensions and million for the highest rated credit types 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns  we sell loan participations to outside participants 
at december  and  the outstanding balance of loan participations sold by us was million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling million and million  respectively 
we use the same analysis in deciding whether or not to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan 
due to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution  our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank 
the following table describes the number of relationships and the percentage of the dollar value of the loan portfolio by the size of the credit relationship 
the majority of the loan relationships exceeding million are in our real estate and commercial portfolios 
at december    and  there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of of total loans 
however  the company may be subject to additional regulatory supervisory oversight due to its concentration in commercial real estate lending 
pursuant to interagency guidance issued by the federal reserve and other federal banking agencies  supervisory criteria were put in place to define commercial real estate concentrations as construction  land development and other land loans that represent or more of total risk based capital  or commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance that represent or more of total risk based capital and the real estate portfolio has increased by more than or more during the prior months 
at december  and  the company was considered to have a commercial real estate concentration

we apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations 
our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our commitments 
commercial loans 
commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium sized businesses in a wide variety of industries 
the bank s areas of emphasis in commercial lending include  but are not limited to  loans to wholesalers  manufacturers  construction and business services companies 
we provide a broad range of commercial loans  including lines of credit for working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes 
commercial loans are generally collateralized by inventory  accounts receivable  equipment  real estate and other commercial assets  and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees 
however  where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower  loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business 
terms of commercial loans generally range from one to five years  and the majority of such loans have floating interest rates

real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral 
we generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship 
we make commercial real estate loans at both fixed and floating interest rates  with maturities generally ranging from five to years 
the bank s underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed of the appraised value of the property securing the loan 
in addition  we originate small business administration loans sba on owner occupied properties with maturities of up to years in which the sba allows for financing of up to of the project cost and takes a security position that is subordinated to us  as well as us department of agriculture usda rural development loans 
at december   less than of our outstanding loans were guaranteed by the sba and approximately were guaranteed by the usda 
we also originate residential mortgage loans on a limited basis as an accommodation to our preferred customers 
the primary risks of real estate mortgage loans include the borrower s inability to pay  material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral and significant increases in interest rates  
table of contents which may make the real estate mortgage loan unprofitable 
historically  we have not actively sought residential mortgage loans for our own portfolio  but rather refer such loans to other financial institutions 
however  for those residential mortgage loans that are extended  we attempt to apply conservative loan to value ratios and obtain personal guarantees and generally require a strong history of debt servicing capability and fully amortized terms of years or less 
real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy 
the properties securing the company s real estate mortgage loan portfolio are located primarily in the states of colorado and arizona

we originate loans to finance construction projects involving one to four family residences 
we provide financing to residential developers that we believe have demonstrated a favorable record of accurately projecting completion dates and budgeting expenses 
we provide loans for the construction of both pre sold projects and projects built prior to the location of a specific buyer  although loans for projects built prior to the identification of a specific buyer are provided on a more selective basis 
residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates 
in addition  these loans are generally secured by personal guarantees to provide an additional source of repayment 
we generally require a permanent financing commitment or prequalification be in place before we make a residential construction loan 
moreover  we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of a speculative loan be no more than of the appraised value of the completed construction project or of pre sold projects 
values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers 
with the deep valuation declines in the real estate markets throughout and  the company has become very selective in the extension of credit for new construction projects 
the company has intentionally managed the construction portfolio down in to million at december   from million at december  during  management succeeded in shrinking the portfolio from million at december  we also originate loans to finance the construction of multi family  office  industrial  retail and tax credit projects

nonperforming assets our nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  past due loans more than days  other real estate owned other repossessed assets 
nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
impaired loans are defined as loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement all of which were on a non accrual basis 
the following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated

a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 

table of contents when the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan  which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower  or the reduction of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amount in was not material 
oreo represents real property taken by the bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower 
repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers 
repossessed assets and oreo are carried at the lesser of cost or fair market value  less selling costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the valuation of oreo assets

in addition to the nonperforming assets described above  the company had customer relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans with outstanding principal of approximately million 
a potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower s future performance under the terms of the loan contract 
for our protection  management monitors these loans closely 
these loans are current as to the principal and interest and  accordingly  are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
however  further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
analysis of allowance for loan and credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have been incurred at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s recognition of a separate reserve for off balance sheet loan commitments and letters of credit 
while the allowance for loan losses is recorded as a contra asset to the loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheets  the allowance for credit losses is recorded in accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although the allowances are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets  any losses incurred from credit losses would be reported as a charge off in the allowance for loan losses  since any loss would be recorded after the off balance sheet commitment had been funded 
due to the relationship of these allowances  as extensions of credit underwritten through a comprehensive risk analysis  information on both the allowance for loan and credit losses positions is presented in the following table 

table of contents for the year ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses charged to operations balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period balance of allowance for credit losses at beginning of period provision credit for credit losses charged to operations balance of allowance for credit losses at end of period total provision for loan and credit losses charged to operations ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans average loans outstanding during the period additions to the allowances for loan and credit losses  which are charged as expenses on our consolidated statements of operations  are made periodically to maintain the allowances at the appropriate level  based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan and commitment portfolios 
loans charged off  net of amounts recovered from previously charged off loans  reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  amount of loan losses charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions 
federal regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan and credit losses  or regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan and commitment portfolio in the future  may request the bank increase such allowances 
either of these events could adversely affect our earnings 
further  there can be no assurance that actual loan and credit losses will not exceed the allowances for loan and credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements i specific reserves determined in accordance with asc topic receivables formerly fas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan based on probable losses on specific loans  ii general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in asc topic contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company  and iii unallocated reserves 
specific reserves 
the company continuously evaluates its reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
reserves on loans identified as 
table of contents impaired are based on discounted expected cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  the observable market value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
the fair value of the collateral is determined in accordance with asc loans are considered to be impaired in accordance with the provisions of asc  when it is probable that all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms will not be collected 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the financial condition of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral and general economic conditions 
general reserves 
general reserves are considered part of the allocated portion of the allowance 
we use a comprehensive loan grading process for our loan portfolios 
based on this process  we assign a loss factor to each pool of graded loans 
we use a combination of our long term average loss experience and external loss data in determining the appropriate loss factor 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for factors  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
factors considered by management that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with our current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience include changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  and the effect of external factors  such as legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank s current portfolio 
the company has an internal loan review department that operates independent of the lending function to challenge and corroborate the loan grading system and provide additional analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the allocated reserve for graded loans  a portion of the allowance is determined by segmenting the portfolio into product groupings with similar risk characteristics 
part of the segmentation involves assigning increased reserve factors to those lending activities deemed higher risk such as leverage financings  unsecured loans  certain loans lacking personal guarantees  land acquisition and development loans  and speculative real estate loans 
this supplemental portion of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any additional amounts necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excess concentration risks 
concentration risk limits have been established for  among other things  certain industry concentrations  large balance and highly leveraged credit relationships that exceed specified risk grades  and loans originated with policy exceptions 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including the performance of our loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
unallocated reserves 
the unallocated reserve  which is judgmentally determined  is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans 
table of contents or pools of loans 
included in the unallocated reserve is a missed grade component that is intended to capture the inherent risk that certain loans may be assigned the incorrect loan grade 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses 
these changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves 
the historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio  which are key considerations in this analysis  are updated quarterly and are weighted more heavily for recent economic conditions 
the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the audit committee quarterly for its review and consideration 
the table below provides an allocation of the allowance for loan and credit losses by loan and commitment type  however  allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories at december  in thousands amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition and development real estate construction consumer other unallocated off balance sheet commitments total we believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
we believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
the land acquisition and development land a d component has been identified by management as a higher risk loan category 
the quality of the land a d category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the company has securing the loan in the event of default 
loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots 
management relies heavily on recent loss experience in determining risk in the category which it believes provides a more accurate gauge of actual risk given the negative trends in the current economic cycle 
economic conditions that began to deteriorate in late worsened in with high profile bankruptcies  government orchestrated mergers and a freeze in the credit markets 
conditions continued to worsen in with broad economic declines  historically high unemployment rates  continued devaluation of real estate  and severe credit defaults 
despite indications the economic recession may have technically ended there continues to be strong pressure holding real estate values down near recent lows and asset quality also remains low 
borrowers in general are strained as depressed consumer spending has stressed revenues and cash flows which has in turn caused sharp increases in the past due obligations  foreclosures and charge offs of lenders 
the arizona and colorado markets the company operates in were not immune to these widespread economic problems 
the provision for loan and credit losses of the company increased by million and million to million and million for the respective years ended december  and during and  the company provided million and million more in provision for loan and credit losses than net charge offs during the respective years 
the company s allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans decreased from 
table of contents at december  to at december   a decline largely the result of the elevated net charge off activity during the year 
we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  due to changes in the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and credit losses  it is possible management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan and credit losses 
such determination could have an adverse effect in the level of future loan and credit loss provisions and the company s earnings

net interest income 
the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates may impact our net interest margin 
the federal open markets committee fomc uses the federal funds rate  which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other  to influence interest rates and the national economy 
changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans issued by the company

sources of funds include customer deposits  scheduled amortization of loans  loan prepayments  scheduled maturities of investments and cash flows from mortgage backed securities 
liquidity needs may also be met by deposit growth  converting assets into cash  raising funds in the brokered certificate of deposit market or borrowing using lines of credit with correspondent banks  the fhlb  the frb or the treasury

the proceeds will be used to support the growth and related capital needs of the bank  expand our operations through new de novo branch offices  fund possible acquisitions  and fund working capital needs 
at december   shareholders equity totaled million  a million decrease from december  the decrease was primarily due to a net loss of million  dividends paid on preferred stock of million  and dividends paid on common stock of million 
the aforementioned decreases were offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock  million in stock based compensation expense  million of stock options  excess tax benefits on option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity  and an increase of million in accumulated other comprehensive income due mainly to net unrealized gains in the available for sales securities portfolio 

table of contents on june   the company terminated its revolving line of credit facility with us bank national association 
the revolving line of credit had an aggregate principal sum of up to million with an interest rate based on a libor based rate or a variable federal funds based rate  plus a spread of 
the agreement was terminated at the request of the company prior to its expiration on july  there was no amount drawn on the line of credit at the time of the termination and no premium or penalty was assessed to the company for early termination 
the company successfully completed a private placement of million of subordinated unsecured promissory notes during the third and fourth quarters of proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes 
the notes qualify as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
management believes the company continues to have good internal capital generation to support its operations 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations together with alternative sources of funding ie taf are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  loan originations  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next months 
we continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs  including but not limited to  debt issuance  common stock issuance and deposit funding sources 
based on our current financial condition and our results of operations  we believe that the company will be able to sustain its ability to raise adequate capital through one of these financing sources 
we are subject to minimum risk based capital limitations as set forth by federal banking regulations at both the consolidated company level and the bank level 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets  including certain off balance sheet items  such as loan commitments in excess of one year and letters of credit  are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
for purposes of the risk based capital guidelines  total capital is defined as the sum of tier and tier capital elements  with tier capital being limited to of tier capital 
tier capital includes  with certain restrictions  common shareholders equity  perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
tier capital includes  with certain limitations  perpetual preferred stock not included in tier capital  certain maturing capital instruments  and the allowance for loan and credit losses 
at december   the bank was well capitalized with a tier capital ratio of  and total capital ratio of 
the minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized under the risk based capital standards are and  respectively 
at the holding company level  the company s tier capital ratio at december   was  and its total capital ratio 
total risk based capital for the consolidated company increased by million during in order to comply with the regulatory capital constraints  the company and its board of directors constantly monitor the capital level and its anticipated needs based on the company s growth 
the company has identified sources of additional capital that could be used if needed  and monitors the costs and benefits of these sources  which include both the public and private markets 
the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities through statutory trusts that are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the accounts of the statutory trust  capital trust ii and capital trust iii are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements  million in trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are included in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the federal reserve board at december  on march   the federal reserve board finalized a rule that would continue to allow the inclusion of trust preferred securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts in tier capital  but with stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
under the rule  after a transition period ending on march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be limited to of tier capital elements  net of goodwill that has been reduced by any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to certain restrictions 
on march   the federal reserve board announced the adoption of a final rule that delays the initial effective date of march  to march  upon adoption of this rule  the company would still maintain its well capitalized status 

table of contents the company s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off balance sheet commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in the following contractual obligations and commitments section 
the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments 
contractual obligations and commitments summarized below are the company s contractual obligations excluding deposit liabilities to make future payments at december  after one after three within but within but within after in thousands one year three years five years five years total federal funds purchased repurchase agreements operating lease obligations long term debt obligations preferred stock  series b dividend supplemental executive retirement plan total contractual obligations interest on these obligations has been excluded due to the short term nature of the instruments 
principal repayment of the junior subordinated debentures is assumed to be at the contractual maturity while principal repayment of the subordinated notes payable is assumed to be its first call date see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures is calculated at the fixed rate associated with the applicable hedging instrument through the instrument maturity date see note to the consolidated financial statements and then at the current variable rate through contractual maturity and is reported in the due within categories during which the interest expense is expected to be incurred 
included in long term debt obligations are estimated interest payments related to subordinated debt junior and unsecured of million due within one year  million due after one but within three years  million due after three but within five years and million due after five years 
variable interest rate payments on junior subordinated debentures after maturity of the related fixed interest rate swap hedge and actual interest payments will differ based on actual libor and actual amounts outstanding for the applicable periods 
cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b issued to the us treasury in december includes dividends payable at on million 
the preferred shares are shown in the table as being due in the after three but within five years category which assumes the million in preferred stock will be redeemed in the year prior to the contractual dividend rate step up to effective in december the company has employed a strategy to expand its offering of fee based products through the acquisition of entities that complement its business model 
we will often structure the purchase price of an acquired entity to include an earn out  which is a contingent payment based on achieving future performance levels 
given the uncertainty of today s economic climate and the performance challenges it creates for companies  we feel the use of earn outs in acquisitions is an effective method to bridge the expectation gap between a buyer s caution and a seller s optimism 
earn outs help to protect buyers from paying a full valuation up front without the assurance of the acquisition s performance  while allowing sellers to participate in the full value of the company provided the anticipated performance does occur 
since the earn out payments are determined based on the acquired company s performance during the earn out period  the total payments to be made are not known at the time of the acquisition 
the company has committed to make additional earn out payments to the former owners of wagner based on earnings and performance 
at december   the company did not accrue for any earn out payments for the fiscal year no amount was earned under the earn out arrangements for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these earn outs 

table of contents the company  at the time of the purchase of the assets of bda  placed into escrow million as deferred purchase price that could be earned by achieving certain agreed upon performance measures over the two year period following the acquisition 
at december   it was determined the unit had met the first of two performance measures and in january million of the deferred purchase price was released to the former owners 
at december   performance measures were not met  no additional amounts were earned under the deferred purchase price arrangement and the remaining million was released from escrow to the company 
the contractual amount of the company s financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  expiring by period at december   is presented below after one after three within but within but within after in thousands one year three years five years five years total unfunded loan commitments standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit unfunded commitments for unconsolidated investments company guarantees total commitments the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the liquidity  credit enhancement and financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments 
the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults 
to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit obligate the company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if  under the contractual terms of the agreement  the customers are unable to do so 
the financial standby letters of credit issued by the company are irrevocable 
payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower s failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary 
approximately million of total commitments at december   represent commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest  which exposes the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates at the balance sheet date 
interest rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above 

table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december   as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward of up to basis points 
due to the current interest rate environment the fomc has a basis point target federal funds rate at december   with prime set at basis points above the fomc target the downward movement analysis was limited to a basis point change 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december   will remain constant over the month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income n a market value of equity n a 
table of contents our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and investments  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table

our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 

table of contents we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  less than one to over in thousands one year five years five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other total loans of the million of loans with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and million were variable rate loans at december  to augment our asset and liability management strategy  we also began using interest rate swaps on our loan portfolio in  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
since we implemented the program in  we have entered into different interest rate swap agreements  seven of which were outstanding at december  under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the prime rate 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc  originally issued as sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows we receive from certain of our prime indexed loans 
in accordance with asc  these swap agreements are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swaps that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects oci and reclassified into interest income when such cash flows occur in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedges is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of noninterest income 
interest rate swap information at december   is summarized as follows

in february  the company initiated a new series of interest rate swap transactions designated as cash flow hedges 
the intent of the transactions are to fix the effective interest rate of payments due on its junior subordinated debentures with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to adverse changes in cash flows relating to payments on its libor based floating rate debt 
the swap agreements having a total notional value of million will fix the interest rates between and and mature over varying lengths of time from five and years 
these interest rate swaps are effective for cash settlements beginning in february
