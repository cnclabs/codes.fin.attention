table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general we are a petroleum company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploitation and development of properties for the production of crude oil and natural gas  onshore in the united states 
we acquire known  underdeveloped oil and natural gas resources and exploit them through the application of capital  sound engineering and modern technology to increase production  ultimate recoveries  or both 
we are focused on increasing underlying asset values on a per share basis 
in doing so  we depend on a conservative capital structure  allowing us to maintain control of our assets for the benefit of our shareholders  including approximately beneficially owned by all of our employees 
our strategy is intended to generate scalable  low unit cost  development and re development opportunities that minimize or eliminate exploration risks 
these opportunities involve the application of modern technology  our own proprietary technology and our specific expertise in overlooked areas of the united states 
the assets we exploit currently fit into three types of project opportunities enhanced oil recovery eor  bypassed primary resources  and unconventional shale gas development 
we expect to fund our fiscal development plan from working capital and net cash flows from our properties in the giddings and delhi fields  although we also may utilize appropriate financing to fund additional development above our development plan 
highlights for our fiscal year oil gas reserves proved reserves increased to million boe 
proved and probable combined reserves increased to million boe 
this compares to million boe of proved and million boe of proved and probable reserves at june  proved reserves are oil and liquids  as compared to and at june  pv of proved reserves increased  from million to million 
pv of proved and probable reserves increased  from million to million 
we believe the presentation of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies and the relative monetary significance of their oil and natural gas properties 
pv is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves  nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure as defined under gaap 
see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 

table of contents we added million net barrels of proved oil reserves at delhi 
net proved and probable reserves at delhi increased to million barrels of oil due to greater expected recovery based on the earlier and stronger than anticipated eor response  and the inclusion of additional pay zones 
fiscal was a pivotal year for the delhi field 
following four years of field development and million of related capital expended by the operator  we obtained first eor production in march  three months earlier than the anticipated mid summer response date 
this early response further supported our independent reservoir engineer s assignment of million net barrels of proved and probable oil reserves  million of which are classified as proved reserves 
of the million net barrels of proved and probable oil reserves approximately five million are associated with our royalty interests 
this compares to million barrels of probable reserves  and no proved reserves  assigned to delhi by d m at the end of fiscal the current reserve report includes changes to the delhi eor development plan that resulted in both positive and negative impacts on our delhi reserves 
the expected future purchase volumes of co were substantially increased  particularly during the pre payout period  thereby extending the pre payout period 
in addition  title work by dnr has determined that a small amount of the working interest is owned by third parties  resulting in a minor reduction to our after payout working interest from to 
these adverse effects are more than offset by three positive revisions 
first  the early strong production response  combined with further analysis  have led to a higher expected peak production rate and an increase in the recovery rate from to of original oil in place 
second  d m has concurred with the expansion of the eor project to several additional  analogous reservoirs within the field 
the combination of these two revisions brings total expected proved and probable gross recoveries to mmbo 
third  reserves now include the benefit of the eor severance tax holiday granted by the state of louisiana 
for evolution shareholders  the combination of these effects equates to mmbo of added proved and probable reserves and a million increase in pv associated with our proved and probable reserves  offset by an approximate month delay in reversionary payout compared to the report 
at june   proved pv at delhi is million and probable pv is million 
see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 
our fourth quarter depletion rate of per boe is a proxy for our average historical full cycle f d costs 
since we have never had a ceiling test write down of our oil and gas properties  our current depletion rate is equal to our average historical  full cycle finding and development costs for proved reserves 
our proved reserves are developed  but we bear no expected future capital expenditures related to our mmbo of proved undeveloped reserves at delhi 
while less than of delhi s planned producing wells were online at june   approximately of budgeted project costs had been expended by the operator through june  due to delayed testing at our neptune oil project in south texas  we have elected to revise our mbo of proved undeveloped reserves as probable reserves as of june  delay in obtaining power and then unforeseen mechanical difficulties in obtaining adequate saltwater injection capacity delayed the start of our production testing to the fourth fiscal quarter 
we will continue to test the project through a workover of the existing producer and re entry of potentially two additional producer wells during fiscal we made progress with our first producing test well in our shallow woodford shale project in wagoner county  ok  establishing bcf of proved and probable reserves in and around the henry vertical test well 
in late february we began steady state production by flaring production from the henry 
production steadily increased from an initial low rate as the localized area of the reservoir dewatered 
at the end of april  water rates were decreasing while gas production rates were increasing past our targeted peak rate of mcfd  reaching a rate of mcfd of gas before the well was shut in due to power failure due to lightning 
although we are unable to predict the final peak gas rate capability of this well  we believe this result is very encouraging and suggests that the dewatering process relieves the hydrostatic formation pressure to allow increasing gas rates  typically followed by a long slow decline curve 
an additional test well was put on production in the southern block of our wagoner leasehold with a different frac application and was disappointing 
we expect to again test this block in a different location using the frac utilized in the henry well 
as previously reported  in a separate well we also performed a brief production test of the caney shale and determined its modest economic potential to be limited to an add on to the woodford shale 

table of contents we replaced of our mboe net production at the giddings field in central texas and ended the fiscal year with proved reserves of mmboe and probable reserves of mboe 
due to upgrading of our portfolio of drilling locations  proved pv at giddings increased from the prior year to million 
see looking forward to for a discussion of the joint development agreement entered into subsequent to our year ended june  see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 
operations first tertiary oil production began at delhi in march our share of production from delhi  net to our royalty interests for the year ended june   was  bbls of oil compared to bbls of oil during the year ended june  in june  gross field production was slightly over bopd 
denbury is continuing its multi year roll out of the project by installing phase ii and phase iii in the field through the addition of producer and injector wells and associated facilities in the field  which is expected to provide a continued steady increase in oil production 
once denbury has generated sufficient net revenues to offset direct operating expenses of the project by the deemed million payout  we will receive a working interest of denbury s interest  and an incremental estimated revenue interest increasing our revenue interest to 
we expect to continue bearing no capital expenditures or operating costs until such payout occurs  after which we begin paying our working interest share of future costs 
sales volumes decreased in fiscal versus fiscal our decrease in sales volumes for the year was solely attributable to our normal production decline in the giddings field 
production from our properties in the giddings field decreased from  boe during the fiscal year ended june to  boe during the fiscal year ended june  production of natural gas from our properties in the giddings field increased  while production of crude oil and ngls decreased compared to the year ended june  first eor oil production at delhi began in the last two weeks of march our net production from delhi for the year ended june  was  bbls of oil compared to bbls of oil during the year ended june  we lowered our depletion rate to less than per boe during the fourth quarter of fiscal our depletion rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was per boe  compared to for the third quarter of the decrease in our depletion rate was due to the addition of million barrels of proved oil reserves at delhi  while associated legacy capital costs of only million of costs per incremental barrel were transferred to our full cost pool 
the product prices we received declined in fiscal versus fiscal during the year ended june   the average price we received was per boe  as compared to per boe during the year ended june  finances we ended the year with million of working capital  compared to million at june  at june   working capital included million of cash  cash equivalents and short term certificates of deposit  and million of recoverable income taxes arising from current year tax losses carried back to a prior tax year 
the million reduction in our working capital since june  was due primarily to investments of million in oil and natural gas properties  offset by positive cash flow generated from our oil and gas properties cash flows from operations covered our general and administrative expenses and funded a portion of our capital expenditures 
cash flows from operations were million during the year ended june   which includes million received in january from the internal revenue service as a result of a carry back of our tax loss for the year ended june  non cash stock based compensation expense of million comprised over of g a for fiscal year non cash stock based compensation expense remains an important part of our total compensation program to help motivate and retain high performing employees and consultants  in addition to conserving our cash resources 
we nearly completed negotiations with an industry partner to help finance the resumption of development drilling at giddings 
for details  see the looking forward section below 

table of contents we filed a universal shelf registration with the sec 
with considerable market price volatility becoming more common  we view a shelf registration as an important part of prudent capital management 
we remained debt free 
all of our expenditures were funded solely by working capital and we ended our fiscal year with no funded debt 
looking forward into our base case capital budget of million will focus on selective low cost testing and development of our current portfolio properties within the following major operations continue the roll out of the co eor project at delhi that is operated and funded by denbury 
the operator is continuing development activities through its installation of phases ii and iii that began earlier in calendar  and the rate of co injection has continued to increase 
further roll out is expected to continue during our fiscal gross oil production  and our resulting net production from our royalty interests  is expected to substantially increase during the year accordingly 
resume development drilling at giddings on up to of our proved and probable drilling locations 
immediately following the close of our recently completed fiscal year  we entered into a joint development agreement jda with an industry partner 
the jda provides that we operate the drilling of two firm commitment wells on our proved locations in the giddings field  with the potential to add up to three option wells as elected by our partner 
under the terms of the jda  we will receive a carried working interest in recognition of our costs to date  a cost bearing working interest for our cash participation  and a back in working interest on each well drilled on our partner s working interest following a simple well basket payout and well by well simple pay out on the subsequent wells bringing our after payout working interest to 
the leases carry approximately net revenue interest to the working interest 
the first location  the supak brinkman h located in burleson county  is a million gross afe re entry operation to add a single austin chalk lateral to an existing wellbore 
we began operations on this location in late august  we expect to follow with drilling operations on a million gross afe grass roots location new well  the dodd  in northern grimes county to complete two  opposing laterals into the georgetown formation 
our outside engineers have assigned to the working interest approximately  net boe of proved reserves to the supak and  net boe of reserves to the dodd 
the dodd reserves are split evenly between proved and probable reserve categories 
our share of expected net capital expenditures for the jv program is million  assuming all five wells are drilled 
we are also exploring opportunities to enter into a second joint venture to develop additional drilling locations  which would require an increase in our capital subject to the terms of such joint venture 
increase our woodford shale test activity 
we plan to complete up to two more test wells at our shallow  depth woodford acreage block in wagoner county  ok during fiscal to add to our knowledge base 
separately  in our mid depth haskell county  ok  woodford shale leasehold  we expect to begin re entry operations on the first of a two vertical well program to begin testing vertical completions in the woodford between  and  depth 
we intend to use the information gained to attract candidates for joint venture development 
pursue commercial joint ventures utilizing our proprietary artificial lift technology 
based on tests results at giddings  we believe our technology could re establish production in many wells throughout giddings and other fields developed with horizontal wells where liquids are associated with their production 
we are currently negotiating with a major producer at giddings  and have entered into discussions with a second producer  to provide our lift technology with the intent of gaining an interest in the newly re established production 
we also plan on approaching other producers during fiscal for potential applications both within and outside of giddings 
continue testing of our neptune oil project in south texas 
now that adequate water injection capacity exists in the field  we plan to conduct a workover on the garcia producer to re complete in a different portion of the mirando sand and re enter up to two additional producer wells to complete our testing program 

table of contents exercise lease options and renew other leases 
we plan to exercise lease options and renew other leases to maintain high value drilling locations at giddings and our leasehold in oklahoma  as well as provide funds for forced pooling associated with producing woodford wells in oklahoma 
continued conservative financial management 
emphasize long term share value over near term earnings during the current period of low natural gas prices 
retain financial strength and flexibility to assure we obtain proper value of our core assets 
primarily use internally generated funds and our working capital to achieve our goals for fiscal we may accelerate our development operations where warranted by utilizing joint ventures  project financing  selective divestments of noncore assets or minor equity offerings at attractive stock valuations when capital market conditions improve 
improve financial results through reductions in depletion expense and expected increases in delhi production 
the fourfold increase in proved reserves  without a substantial increase in future capital costs  is expected to dramatically reduce our depletion expense in future periods 
when combined with our expected revenue growth from our delhi royalty interests bearing no future operating expense or incremental expenditures for capital  our financial results are expected to improve 
liquidity and capital resources at june   our working capital was million and we continued to be debt free 
this compares to working capital of million at june  the million decrease in working capital since june   was due primarily to investments of million in oil and natural gas properties not including million incurred related to recognition of asset retirement obligations 
of the million of incurred capital expenditures during the year ended june   million was for leasehold acquisitions and million was for development activities

table of contents sales volumes 
crude oil  ngls  and natural gas sales volumes  net to our interest  for the year ended june  decreased to  boe  compared to  boe for the year ended june  our sales volumes for the year ended june  included  bbls of oil from delhi of which  bbls of oil were sold during the th quarter of and  boe from our properties in the giddings field in texas 
first eor oil production at delhi began in the last two weeks of march total production from delhi  net to our interest  for the year ended june  was  bbls of oil compared to bbls of oil during the year ended june  production from our properties in the giddings field decreased from  boe during the fiscal year ended june to  boe during the fiscal year ended june  production of natural gas from our properties in the giddings field increased  while production of crude oil and ngls decreased compared to the year ended june  petroleum revenues 
crude oil  ngls and natural gas revenues for the year ended june  decreased from the year ended june  this was due to a decline in sales volumes and a decline in the average price received per boe  from per boe for the year ended june  to per boe for the year ended june  lease operating expenses including production severance taxes 
lease operating expenses and production taxes for the year ended june  increased compared to the year ended june   primarily due to the additions of three producing wells and an increase in workover expense from thousand during fiscal to thousand during fiscal lease operating expense and production taxes per barrel of oil equivalent increased from per boe during fiscal  to per boe during fiscal general and administrative expenses g a 
g a expenses decreased to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  the reduction was due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense  which was  of total g a and  of total g a for the year ended june  and  respectively  and a reduction of legal fees of approximately thousand due to the settlement of the delhi litigation in july non cash stock based compensation is an integral part of total staff compensation utilized to recruit quality staff from other  more established companies and  as a result  will likely continue to be a significant component of our g a costs 
depreciation  depletion amortization expense dd a 
dd a decreased by to  for year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net sales volumes  and a lower annual depletion rate vs 
per boe 
our depletion rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was per boe compared to for the rd quarter of  due to the addition of million proved oil reserves at delhi with associated legacy costs of only million transferred to our full cost pool 
the lower fourth quarter rate is the primary cause of the lower annual depletion rate 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended june  decreased  to  compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease in interest income is due to lower average daily balances of cash and short term certificates of deposit and a reduction in market interest rates received on invested cash 
inflation 
although the general inflation rate in the united states  as measured by the consumer price index and the producer price index  has been relatively low in recent years  the oil and gas industry has experienced unusually volatile price movements in commodity prices  vendor goods and oilfield services 
prices for drilling and oilfield services  oilfield equipment  tubulars  labor  expertise and other services greatly impact our lease operating expenses and our capital expenditures 
during fiscal and into fiscal  we saw a substantial decline in both petroleum product prices and drilling and oilfield services costs from prior years  followed more recently by moderate increases in products and services 
product prices  operating costs and development costs may not always move in tandem 
known trends and uncertainties 
while general worldwide economic conditions improved during fiscal  they continue to be uncertain and volatile 
concerns over uncertain future economic growth are affecting numerous industries  companies  as well as consumers  which impact demand for crude oil and natural gas 
if demand decreases in the future  it may put downward pressure on crude oil and natural gas prices  thereby lowering our revenues and working capital going forward 

table of contents seasonality 
our business is generally not directly seasonal  except for instances when weather conditions may adversely affect access to our properties or delivery of our petroleum products 
although we do not generally modify our production for changes in market demand  we do experience seasonality in the product prices we receive  driven by summer cooling and driving  winter heating  and extremes in seasonal weather including hurricanes that may substantially affect oil and natural gas production and imports 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we select certain accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these policies  together with our estimates have a significant affect on our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas properties 
companies engaged in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost accounting method for our oil and natural gas properties as prescribed by sec regulation s x rule under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition  exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized 
oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties and include non producing leasehold  geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs 
we exclude these costs until the property has been evaluated 
costs are transferred to the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated 
as of june   our total unevaluated costs were million 
if these costs were evaluated and included in our full cost pool  with no increases in our proved reserves as of june   our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense would have increased by approximately thousand 
estimates of proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the estimated quantities of proved reserves are used to calculate depletion expense  and the estimated future net cash flows associated with those proved reserves is the basis in determining impairment under the quarterly ceiling test calculation 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  additional development activity  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare our reserve estimates  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for the properties make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements 
material revisions to reserve estimates and or significant changes in commodity prices could substantially affect our estimated future net cash flows of our proved reserves  affecting our quarterly ceiling test calculation and could significantly affect our depletion rate 
a decrease in commodity prices used to determine our proved reserves and standardized measure as of june   would not have resulted in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
holding all other factors constant  a reduction in the company s proved reserve estimate at june  of  and would affect depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by approximately thousand  thousand  and thousand  respectively 
on december   the sec issued its final rule on the modernization of reporting oil and gas reserves 
the new rule allows consideration of new technologies in evaluating reserves  allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors  require reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price based on the prior month period rather than year end prices  revises the disclosure requirements for oil and gas operations  and revises accounting for the limitation on capitalized costs for full cost companies 
the new rule became effective for our annual report on form k for the most recent fiscal ended june  and did not have a material affect on our financial statements 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared or filed  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and net operating loss carry backs and carry forwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our net operating loss 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of june   we have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss that is limited by irs section management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making the assessment of the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  as of end of the current fiscal year  we believe that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this valuation method requires the input of certain assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected term of the award  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rate used is the us treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
our dividend yield is zero  as we do not pay a dividend 
because of our limited trading experience of our common stock and limited exercise history of our stock option awards  estimating the volatility and expected term is very subjective 
we base our estimate of our expected future volatility  on peer companies whose common stock has been trading longer than ours  along with our own limited trading history while operating as an oil and natural gas producer 
future estimates of our stock volatility could be substantially different from our current estimate  which could significantly affect the amount of expense we recognize for our stock based compensation awards 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as of june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
commodity price risk our most significant market risk is the pricing for crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
we expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
in addition  a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if future oil and gas commodity prices sustained a significant decline 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as  if and when needed 
although our current production base may not be sufficient enough to effectively allow hedging  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk
