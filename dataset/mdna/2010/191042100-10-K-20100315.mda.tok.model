spending on purchases for discretionary items  such as the company s citizens band and two way radios  radar detectors and other consumer electronic products  tends to decline during recessionary periods and be focused on lower price point products 
in the economic environment in the us  canada and europe  where substantially all of the company s sales occur  had deteriorated  resulting in an adverse impact on consumer spending for discretionary products  particularly those at higher price points  as store traffic declined at the mass merchants  consumer electronics specialty stores  large department store chains  warehouse clubs and travel center chains that sell the company s products 
for  the company believes there will be a modest global economic recovery with a rebound in consumer spending for discretionary items  including ones at higher price points  although continuing high unemployment will act to moderate this consumer spending rebound 
this modest improvement in the global economy  together with growth achieved through expanded distribution in europe and new product introductions  is anticipated to generate an increase in net sales and favorable product mix is expected to provide an increase in gross margins 
the company will continue to receive the positive effect of lower overhead costs achieved by the cost reduction steps taken in  including a work force reduction and elimination of certain fixed marketing  general and administrative expenses

lower domestic sales made up much of the decline  with citizens band radio and detection sales declining percent and percent  respectively 
the decline in citizens band radios reflected the recession s negative impact on freight traffic  which fell markedly resulting in a reduction in the disposable income of professional drivers and directly impacting sales of citizens band radios  especially those at higher price points 
detection sales declined not only because of reduced demand by consumers and their switch to purchases of lower price point models but also because of a store count reduction by a major retailer  the decision by a major retailer not to repeat a radar promotion with any vendor in and the bankruptcy and liquidation of circuit city in  which accounted for more than percent of radar detection sales in partially offsetting these declines were strong sales of the new mobile navigation product for the professional driver and an percent

margin declines were experienced both domestically and in europe due primarily to an unfavorable sales mix as the recession caused consumers to become very price conscious and focus diminished discretionary spending on purchases of lower price point  lower margin products 
especially impacted were sales of domestic detection products as the average selling price in declined percent compared to the prior year 
the gross margin for domestic citizens band radios also experienced compression because of the shift in discretionary spending by price conscious professional drivers as unit sales of higher price point models sold to professional drivers fell over percent in compared to  a rate that was more than twice that of the decline in unit sales of lower price point models 
also contributing to the decrease in cobra s gross margin was a percent increase in certain sales promotion funds that are accounted for as a reduction in sales in order to help maintain sales in the difficult economy and the impact of the fixed components of the cost of sales being expensed across a lower level of sales  which combined reduced gross margin by approximately one point 
lastly  a weaker euro  down percent compared to  reduced gross margin on sales in europe

the decrease in gross margin was due in part to the impact of the weaker british pound sterling noted above 
also contributing to the decrease in gross margin was a large decrease in high margin aura database sales 
these fees declined as a result of an increase in the portion of sales made outside of the uk  where the consumer s purchase price includes unlimited downloads for competitive reasons  and higher sales of new products that do not use aura database downloads such as gps enabled handheld navigation units designed for the outdoor enthusiast  which are available under the snooper brand as well as various third party brands and provide skiers  runners  hikers and others with maps of trails and a record of their activities 
the shift in sales made outside of the uk reflected both the severity of the recession in the uk compared to other countries in europe and ppl s successful efforts in expanding its distribution channels beyond its uk core market

this conclusion was based on the fact that the us operation had sustained cumulative losses over the past three years  was forecasted to have a loss in because of the recession and had no tax planning strategies available that  if implemented  would generate taxable income sufficient for the us operation to realize in full its net deferred tax assets within a reasonable time horizon absent a turnaround in the business 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of million for a valuation allowance in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a tax benefit of million primarily for the valuation allowance release related to a federal tax refund of  resulting from a provision in the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  enacted november   which allows eligible businesses a one time election to carry back net operating losses from or but not both for three  four or five years rather than the standard two years 
for the company s remaining deferred tax valuation allowance  until the more likely than not realization criteria can be met  the company will not report a us tax benefit for any future pre tax losses or a us tax provision for any future pre tax income 
this does not affect tax reporting for ceel and ppl as each of these is in a separate  non us tax jurisdiction 
beginning in  the company intended to repatriate the future earnings of its irish subsidiary ceel  which will increase the company s effective tax on these earnings to reflect the higher us tax rate once the prior year s net operating loss is utilized and the valuation allowance is reversed

in part  these declines reflected the impact of the deepening recession on store traffic and consumer spending during the fourth quarter holiday selling period and  in the case of citizens band radios  the effect of historically high fuel prices early in the year 
additionally  detection and two way radio sales were negatively impacted as a result of competitive pressures  especially for shelf space for these products at several mass retailers 
two way radio sales were also adversely affected by the declining emphasis on the category by retailers 
partially offsetting these declines were higher sales of power inverters  as a result of expanded distribution and increased promotional activity at travel centers  and two way radios in canada because of increased placement  which helped continue cobra s leading position in this market

the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or a historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions 
the accounting policies and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment  except for revenue from sales of products to certain customers whose contractual terms specify fob destination 
revenue from sales of products to these customers is recognized at the estimated time of receipt by the customer when title and risk of loss would pass to the customer 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described in the policies for sales returns reserve and warranty reserve 
the company bundles aura database subscriptions with certain detection and navigation products and classifies the database subscription as deferred revenue 
additionally  prepaid subscriptions to the aura database are classified as deferred revenue 
the deferred subscription revenue is recognized into income over the applicable subscription period 
sales returns reserve 
the company has a policy that allows its customers to return product that was returned to them by their customers 
the reserve reflects the sales  cost of sales and gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reduction in accounts receivable and increases in inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any known changes in key variables affecting these return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding whether current return rates will approximate anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 
warranty reserve 
the company generally provides a one year consumer warranty for its products and also allows its customers to return product that has been returned by their customers 
consequently  the company maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical return rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales and the unit standard cost of each model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in its estimate  as historical experience indicates that most returns will occur within six months of the company s original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical return rates and how the returned product will be disposed of  either by liquidation or return to vendors for credit on new purchases 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal  either liquidation prices or the credit given by vendors 

table of contents liquidation reserve 
the company maintains a liquidation reserve representing the write down of returned product from our customers to its net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for partial credit against similar  new models  this decision depends upon the estimated future demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to the vendor  taking into consideration the liquidation prices expected to be received and the amount of vendor credit 
the amount of the reserve is determined by comparing the cost of each unit returned to the estimated amount to be realized upon each unit s disposition  either from returning the unit to the vendor for credit towards the cost of new  similar product or liquidating the unit 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price or vendor credit per unit 
net realizable value reserve 
the company maintains a net realizable value reserve to write down below cost  as necessary  certain inventory not previously sold to customers where it is determined that net realizable value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which slow moving  excess or non current models are to be included in the reserve and the estimated net realizable value of such model ie  the per unit price that it is estimated can be received in the marketplace if the model was sold 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined will be sold below cost from quarter to quarter 
advertising and sales promotion accrual 
the advertising and sales promotion accrual reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  generally agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer by multiplying the customer s estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary quarter to quarter depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of its planned program sales  negotiate changes to the term of the existing programs or add new ones  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in such customer s programs 
periodic adjustments may also be necessary for unused customer funds 
deferred compensation 
obligations under the deferred compensation plans which are non qualified defined benefit plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in the determination of obligations under the deferred compensation plans and annual deferred compensation expense include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company

the compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future performance

software related to products to be sold 
the company purchases and or incurs costs in connection with the development of software to be used in products that the company intends to sell  mainly mobile navigation products 
coding and related costs incurred after technological feasibility of the software has been established and a working model of the product developed are capitalized and deferred as intangible assets 
capitalized costs are charged to earnings based on the ratio of actual product sales during the reporting period to expected product sales over the estimated product life cycle 
software related intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date for possible impairment 
if such review indicates that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or if impairment indicators exist 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of estimated fair value of ppl reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
the fair values used in the impairment evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections and comparisons with comparable companies as well as the company s market capitalization 
due to the company s low market capitalization at december   a goodwill impairment evaluation indicated that the entire goodwill balance was impaired and resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist for an amortizable intangible asset  the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets  no impairment charge is recorded 
if the projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the intangible asset to its fair value 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
the deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the company operates  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning and strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred 
table of contents tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
due to the operating results for  the expected continuation of a global recession and the absence of tax planning strategies to generate a sufficient level of taxable income  management concluded the full realization of the deferred tax assets within a reasonable time horizon did not satisfy the more likely than not realization criteria 
accordingly  the company established a million deferred tax valuation allowance for its us operation in the second quarter of the valuation allowance is a non cash charge that does not preclude the company from fully realizing the net deferred tax assets in the future 
at december  the deferred tax valuation allowance totaled million 
we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the united states 
through  the company had not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its irish subsidiary because of the company s intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings 
as of december   us income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of million of such earnings 
it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed 
beginning in  the company intended to repatriate the future earnings of its irish subsidiary ceel  which will increase the company s effective tax on these earnings to reflect the higher us tax rate once the prior year s net operating loss is utilized and the valuation allowance is reversed 
however  since ceel generated an operating loss for  no funds were repatriated to the us in the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange risks and interest rates are inherent to the company s operations 
changes to these factors could cause fluctuations in the company s net earnings  cash flows and the fair values of financial instruments subject to market risks 
the company identifies these risks and mitigates the financial impact with hedging and interest rate swaps 
debt incurred under a revolving loan agreement with a balance of million as of december  is priced at an interest rate that floats with the market 
therefore  the fair value of this debt is not significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market 
a basis point movement in the floating debt rate would result in approximately a  increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows 
also  the company has million of debt as of december  with a rate of interest that is fixed as a result of an interest rate swap 
accordingly  fair value of this fixed rate debt can be significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market 
the company s suppliers are located in china  hong kong and south korea 
the company historically has negotiated substantially all of its purchases in us dollars and  in the case of ppl  uses forward contracts to purchase dollars at a fixed exchange rate to the british pound sterling 
the company considers opportunities to make purchases in other currencies  such as euros  to the extent that doing so would be advantageous in light of currency fluctuations involving the us dollar and other currencies 
in  approximately percent of the company s sales were outside the united states  principally in europe and canada  compared to percent in the company minimizes the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with relationships outside of the united states by conducting nearly all of its transactions in us dollars  except for some billings of its european business  which are conducted in euros and the billings of ppl which are primarily in british pound sterling 
the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however  forward contracts are occasionally used for hedging a portion of the company s european business euro denominated transactions and hedging dollar purchases for ppl 
please refer to notes and in the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference  for further information on the company s financial instruments and derivatives 
since the company did not have any open foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a percent movement in the us dollar pound sterling euro exchange rates is not applicable
