item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   december   and december  should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements below and elsewhere in this annual report 
business overview system wide restaurants fiscal year company company company owned franchise total owned franchise total owned franchise total restaurants at beginning of period b a new restaurants opened restaurants permanently closed restaurants at end of period b a includes nine locations that are classified as discontinued operations 
b includes three locations that are classified as discontinued operations 
there are currently company owned and franchise premium convenience restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  and the united arab emirates uae 
one franchised restaurant in minnesota and one location in the uae closed subsequent to fiscal 
table of contents our restaurants offer innovative savory made to order products featuring our authentic hearth baked crackly crust signature cosi bread and fresh distinctive ingredients 
we maintain a pipeline of new menu offerings that are introduced seasonally through limited time offerings to keep our products relevant to our target customers 
our menu features high quality sandwiches  freshly tossed salads  cosi bagels  hot melts  flatbread pizzas  s mores and other desserts  and a variety of coffees along with other soft drink beverages  bottled beverages including premium still and sparkling water  teas  alcoholic beverages  and other specialty coffees 
our restaurants offer lunch and afternoon coffee in a counter service format  with most offering breakfast and or dinner and dessert menus as well 
we operate our company owned restaurants in two formats cosi and cosi downtown 
cosi downtown restaurants  which are located in nonresidential central business districts  close for the day in the early evening  while cosi restaurants offer dinner and dessert in a casual dining atmosphere 
we are currently eligible to offer franchises in states and the district of columbia 
we offer franchises to area developers and individual franchise operators 
domestically  the initial franchise fee  payable to us  for both an area developer and an individual franchise operator  is  for the first restaurant and  for each additional restaurant 
the fees for international agreements vary based on a variety of factors 
we believe that offering cosi franchised restaurants to area developers and individual franchisees offers the prospects of strong financial returns 
by franchising  we believe we will be able to increase the presence of our restaurants in various markets throughout the country and generate additional revenue without the large upfront capital commitments and risk associated with opening company owned restaurants 
we believe that incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy will position us to maximize the market potential for the cosi brand and concept consistent with our available capital and we expect that company owned restaurants restaurants that we own as opposed to franchised restaurants will always be an important part of our new restaurant growth 
during fiscal  we opened one new company owned restaurant in kohl children s museum in illinois and we purchased one franchised restaurant in minnesota and are now operating it as a company owned location 
during  we permanently closed four underperforming company owned restaurants where we were able to negotiate acceptable lease termination agreements with the landlords 
in addition  during fiscal  we opened six new and permanently closed ten franchised restaurants 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable and generally accepted for companies in the restaurant industry 
we believe that the following addresses the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets asc property  plant  equipment requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of this standard has affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results that have been significant in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment at the individual restaurant level periodically and record an impairment loss whenever we determine impairment factors are present 
we consider a history of poor financial operating performance to be the primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations 
we determine whether a restaurant location is impaired based on expected undiscounted cash flows  generally for the remainder of the lease term  and then determine the impairment charge based on discounted cash flows for the same period 
restaurants are not considered for impairment during 
table of contents the ramp up period before they enter the comparable restaurant base  unless specific circumstances warrant otherwise 
lease termination charges asc exit or disposal cost obligations requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred  rather than at the end of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
for all exit activities  we estimate our likely liability under contractual leases for restaurants that have been closed 
such estimates have affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results and are impacted by management s judgments about the time it may take to find a suitable subtenant or assignee  or the terms under which a termination of the lease agreement may be negotiated with the landlord 
accounting for lease obligations in accordance with asc leases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we take possession 
we include any rent escalations  rent abatements during the construction period and any other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense calculation 
landlord allowances in accordance with asc leases  we record landlord allowances as deferred rent in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize them on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
stock based compensation expense in accordance with asc compensation stock compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense according to the fair value recognition provision  which generally requires  among other things  that all employee share based compensation be measured using a fair value method and that all the resulting compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements 
we measure the estimated fair value of our granted stock options using a black scholes pricing model and of our restricted stock based on the fair market value of a share of registered stock on the date of grant 
the weighted average fair values of the stock options granted through  the last time we issued stock options  were determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation 
pre vesting forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data 
the expected volatility is based on an average of the historical volatility of the company s stock  the implied volatility of market options  peer company volatility  and other factors 
the average expected life represents the period of time that stock option grants are expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical terms and other factors 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate of us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining term equal to the expected life of stock option grants 
income taxes we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets that relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards 
our determination of the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards based on the company s operating results 
a positive adjustment to income will be recorded in future years if we determine that we could realize these deferred tax assets 
we have adopted the provisions of asc income taxes beginning in fiscal no adjustment was made to the beginning retained earnings balance  as the ultimate deductibility of all tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility 
no interest or penalties have been accrued relative to tax positions due to the company having either a tax loss or net operating loss carry forwards to offset any taxable income in all subject years 
as a result  no liability for uncertain tax positions has been recorded 
revenue restaurant net sales 
our company owned restaurant sales are composed almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
we record revenue at the time of the purchase of our products by our customers 
franchise fees and royalties 
franchise fees and royalties includes fees earned from franchise agreements entered into with area developers and franchise operators  as well as royalties received based on sales generated at franchised restaurants 
we recognize the franchise fee in the period in which a franchise location opens or when fees are forfeited as a result of a termination of an area developer agreement 
we recognize franchise royalties in the period in which sales are made by our franchise operators 

table of contents gift card sales 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase gift cards at our restaurants and through our website 
customers can purchase these cards at varying dollar amounts 
at the time of purchase by the customer  we record a gift card liability for the face value of the card purchased 
we recognize the revenue and reduce the gift card liability when the gift card is redeemed 
we do not reduce our recorded liability for potential non use of purchased gift cards

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were approximately million on december   compared with million on december  we had negative working capital of million on december   compared with negative working capital of million as of december  the decrease in working capital was primarily a function of funding the operating loss for the year 
our principal requirements for cash in will be for working capital needs and routine maintenance of our existing restaurants 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities during the twelve month period ended december   was approximately million compared to million of net cash provided by operating activities in the twelve month period ended december  the increase in cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily the result of funding our operating loss and the payment of approximately million for certain lease termination and legal settlement obligations 
total cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the year over year decrease is due primarily to lower capital expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal the capital expenditures during fiscal were primarily for the capital maintenance of our existing company owned restaurants 
during fiscal capital expenditures included the construction of one new company owned restaurant that opened during the second quarter of fiscal cash provided by financing activities during fiscal of million is from the settlement of a claim  in which we recovered short swing profits realized by a stockholder of the company under section b of the securities exchange act of during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of approximately million was from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options 
we currently do not expect to open any additional company owned restaurants or incur any significant remodeling capital costs during fiscal however  we do expect to incur capital maintenance costs on existing company owned restaurants 
as we currently have no credit facility or available line of credit  we expect to fund any required capital maintenance costs on existing company owned locations from cash and cash equivalents on hand  expected cash flows generated by existing company owned restaurants  expected franchise fees and royalties and from the proceeds of a shareholders rights offering which was successfully completed subsequent to the end of fiscal the rights offering was completed during the first quarter of fiscal see note and yielded net proceeds of million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  the proceeds from the completed rights offering and the expected cash flows from company owned restaurant operations and expected franchise fees and royalties will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for working capital needs and maintenance of existing restaurant locations for the next twelve months 
our conclusion is based on our expected performance for fiscal and includes a sensitivity analysis that projects varying levels of decline in consumer demand 
the range of levels selected was based on our reasonable expectation of demand given the seasonality of our historical performance and the potential impact the current economic environment may have on consumer spending 
in analyzing our capital cash outlays during fiscal  of our cash outlay was spent on maintenance costs associated with existing company owned locations 
we currently do not expect significant levels of cash outlays for capital expenditures during fiscal if our company owned restaurants do not generate the cash flow levels that we expect  if new franchised restaurants do not open according to our expectations  if we do not generate the franchise fees and royalties that we currently expect  if we incur significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond our normal liquidity needs  or if we experience other unforeseen circumstances then  in order to fund our cash requirements  we may have to effect further labor reductions in general and administrative support functions  seek to sell certain company owned locations to franchisees and or other third parties  seek other sources of financing or take other actions necessitated by the impact of such unanticipated circumstances 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing  sell company owned locations to franchisees or other third parties or that we will be able to do so in a timely manner and on acceptable terms to meet our requirements 
if the prevailing instability in the credit and financial markets continues  it may be more difficult for the company to obtain additional financing and for franchisees to obtain financing necessary to open restaurants or to acquire company owned locations 
an inability to access additional sources of liquidity to fund our cash needs could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

we have no derivative financial commodity instruments 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  highly liquid  short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations

in fiscals and  interest income was million and million  respectively 
during fiscals and we did not have any significant debt 
foreign currency risk as of fiscal  all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts denominated  in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 

table of contents inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our business are food and labor costs 
some of our food costs are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices 
volatility in the commodity markets such as the wheat and dairy markets can have an adverse impact on our results from operations 
some of our hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage will directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
historically  inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operation
