altera designs  manufactures  and markets a variety of products programmable logic devices plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds  are standard semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  that our customers program to perform desired logic functions in their electronic systems 
hardcopy application specific integrated circuits asics transition customer designs from high density fpgas to low cost non programmable implementations for volume production 
because they are customized only on the last few mask layers  hardcopy asics deliver performance that can be an alternative to traditional asics  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
pre defined design building blocks  known as intellectual property ip cores  can be licensed by customers to add standard functions to their pld designs 
proprietary development software  which operates on personal computers and engineering workstations  is used by customers to develop  compile  and verify their designs  and then program their designs into our plds 
we were one of the first suppliers of complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos plds and are currently a global leader in this market 
our broad range of plds offer unique features as well as differing densities and performance specifications  and serve a wide range of customers 
an overview of typical pld applications within these markets is shown in the table below

table of contents digital logic overview most electronic systems use three types of digital integrated circuits processors  which include microprocessors  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  control central computing tasks and signal processing 
memory stores programming instructions and data 
logic manages the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system 
system designers typically use standard architectures to meet their processor and memory needs  but need a wide variety of logic circuits to differentiate their end products 
most applications use one or more of the following types of logic in their designs asics often referred to as standard cells  asics are manufactured with custom designs created by the customer 
as a result  each asic has a fixed function used by a single customer in a single application 
application specific standard products assps assps are standard devices that usually cannot be customized by the end user 
in contrast to an asic  which is built for a single customer  an assp is built for a specific type of application targeted to a small number of customers 
assps are sometimes described as asics developed for multiple customers 
plds unlike asics and assps  plds are standard products that can be customized for a wide range of applications 
as a result  plds are typically sold to hundreds or thousands of customers 
this flexibility offers many advantages  including simple design changes  shorter design cycles  and lower development costs 
in a broad sense  these products compete with each other as they may be used in the same types of applications in electronic systems 
however  differences in cost  performance  density  flexibility  ease of use  and time to market dictate how much they directly compete for particular applications 
the table below summarizes key characteristics of asics  assps  and plds 
asic assp pld customizable yes  by chip fabrication facility no yes  by end user erasability reprogrammability no no yes relative time to market slow immediate fast relative unit cost low moderate moderate to high customer s development cost high low moderate field upgradability no no yes plds vs 
asics and assps in contrast to asics  pld designs are programmed directly into the pld 
this means that the pld is fully functional and verified when the design is completed  avoiding the lengthy and complex cycles required to verify and fabricate asics 
this user programmability allows pld customers to test and revise their designs quickly and with minimal development cost 
in addition to these ease of use and time to market advantages  plds can be upgraded in the field  which allows customers to modify the pld design after the electronic system has been shipped 
customers use assps when they need specific fixed functions with little differentiation  for example when implementing certain electronic industry standards 
however  assps have fixed functionality  which limits the range of applications they can address 
in contrast to assps  pld flexibility allows customers to define functionality to suit their needs  rather than restrict their system architecture based on assp manufacturer specifications 
furthermore  pld designers can add ip design blocks to execute standardized functions otherwise performed by assps 
these design flexibility advantages historically resulted in a relatively high unit cost for plds 
programmability required a larger die size  which typically translated into a higher per unit cost when compared to asics or assps manufactured using the same process technology 
as a result  unit volume for plds was typically lower than for asics or assps 
for our most current designs  pld process technology is typically two or three process generations more advanced than asic and assp process technology 
as chip manufacturing becomes more advanced  the total cost of chip development increases  reducing the cost advantage of asics and assps 
as a result  some asic and assp suppliers choose to use non leading edge process technology for new designs to reduce costs 
we believe this has brought us to a tipping point with respect to our opportunity to displace asics and assps 
it is no longer technologically feasible for asic and assp suppliers to continue to use old process generations for technically advanced systems  and at the same time it is not economically feasible for them to use new generations of technology for low and mid range volume applications 
the process technology gap between plds and asic and assp alternatives will increase over time and  when combined with the traditional pld advantages of greater flexibility  lower development cost  and faster time to market  should drive the accelerated adoption of plds in the years ahead 

table of contents in addition  we believe that innovations in pld architecture and pld development tools have also contributed to the increasing use of plds over asics and assps 
newer pld capabilities  such as high speed transceivers  programmable power technology  and embedded digital signal processing dsp  help electronics engineers use plds to meet increasingly complex system requirements for performance  power consumption and cost 
consequently  we believe that customers will increasingly use plds not only for prototyping  but also for production quantities rather than asics or assps 
strategy and competition our greatest growth opportunity is in the displacement of asics and assps in the development of next generation electronic systems 
we believe that the increasing cost of advanced chip manufacturing technology drives the development and use of standard programmable digital integrated circuits 
as with microprocessors and memory  plds provide the flexibility for the customer to define and change functions without incurring the cost  risk  and delays of custom chip fabrication 
to capture a larger share of the chips purchased by our customers  we focus on providing the most advanced programmable solutions plds with the speed  density  low power consumption  functionality  and package types to meet customer needs plds optimized for low cost and high volume applications hardcopy asics to enable our customers to move easily from our largest plds to a low cost asic optimized  pre verified system level ip cores to speed the design process state of the art development tools that offer low cost  ease of use  and compatibility with other industry standard electronic design automation eda tools a complete customer support system as a result  our strategy in recent years has not only been to add more prototyping customers  but more importantly  to use cost optimized products to increase our penetration into higher volume applications and end markets 
pld vendors have innovated and used the most advanced process technology to rapidly reduce pld cost structure and power consumption while increasing device speed and density 
this makes programmable logic an increasingly competitive alternative to asics and assps and will increase the use of plds 
in addition  the ability to quickly and efficiently integrate system level ip within a pld not only provides advantages relative to asics and assps  but it also allows the displacement of other semiconductor products including digital signal processors and microcontrollers 
as a result  we may encounter a variety of semiconductor vendors during a given customer engagement 
semiconductor companies we may compete with include international business machines corp 
ibm  nec corporation  toshiba semiconductor company  lsi logic corporation  texas instruments inc  freescale semiconductor inc and microchip technology inc 
we compete directly with other pld vendors to realize the asic and assp displacement opportunity and for market share within the pld market 
using publicly available data and information obtained from gartner dataquest  we estimate that two vendors altera and xilinx  inc account for of the total pld market 
the smaller vendors  including lattice semiconductor corporation and actel corporation  together represent approximately of the pld market 
two distinct sub segments of the pld market  cplds and fpgas  comprise the majority of revenues but  due to product differences  usually do not compete directly for the same customer designs 
the fpga market has outgrown the cpld market over the last several years 
fpgas now account for approximately of total pld sales and are expected to continue to be the fastest growing segment of the pld market 
based on our estimates  we believe that our share of the fpga market increased from in to in  and that maintaining or increasing our fpga market share is important to our long term growth 
competition among pld vendors is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design  when customers select products for use in their systems 
because each vendor s products are proprietary  the cost to switch plds after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  customers rarely switch pld vendors after the initial selection for a particular design 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be two or more years before the customer starts volume purchases of our devices 
typically  the customer selects the pld vendor relatively early in the design process  but it may take several years to complete system design  build prototypes  sample the marketplace for customer acceptance  make modifications  and manufacture in volume 
thus  there is a delay between developing a competitive advantage and experiencing a shift in pld market share  meaning that market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success or timing of a customer s product  and because the end markets are highly fragmented we have over  pld customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their competitive strength in winning designs at a particular point in time 

table of contents the principal competitive factors in the pld market include technical innovation device performance  power consumption  and features capability and productivity of software development tools and ip cores pricing and availability quality and reliability technical service and customer support manufacturing and operational competence customer familiarity with existing vendors and entrenched products we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our proprietary device architecture and installed base of software development systems provides some competitive advantage 
due to unique architectural innovation and advanced technologies  our new product families provide greater functionality and lower power consumption at a lower price for any given density compared to their predecessors 
newer product features such as multi gigabit transceivers and programmable power technology have enhanced our design win rate relative to other pld vendors 
we also believe that our new product families compete favorably against asics and assps  as well as against other types of chips such as microcontrollers  microprocessors  and digital signal processors 
designers can add some of the functionality of these other chips to plds using pre built and pre verified ip cores 
an ip core is typically offered in either a hard or soft form 
a hard ip core is embedded into the actual circuitry of our chips 
a soft ip core is a licensed design file that our customers incorporate into their design and program onto the pld 
by incorporating more functionality and logic capacity on a programmable chip while providing the necessary design tools and ip cores to design a reliable system  we believe we can enhance the advantages of plds over competing solutions 
as is true of the semiconductor industry as a whole  the digital logic segment and the pld sub segment are intensely competitive  and each successive product generation is characterized by rapid technological change and price decline 
all of these factors may adversely affect our future operating results 
products our products consist primarily of devices  ip cores  and proprietary development tools 
a brief overview of these products follows 
devices our devices fall into the following four categories  spanning multiple architectures and families with numerous product options fpgas cplds hardcopy asics configuration devices that store the programming code for our fpgas our percentage of net sales by product category is as follows product fpgas cplds other products including hardcopy asics  configuration devices  ip cores  and development tools each device family has unique functional benefits and different density and performance specifications 
some of our latest device families  typically designed into new equipment  are summarized and described below 

table of contents stratix iii and stratix iv high end  system level fpgas our stratix product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and address a broad range of applications requiring system integration across all our markets 
stratix fpgas provide high logic density and performance and low power consumption  while offering high speed and flexible embedded system functionality such as memory and dsp blocks 
additionally  our stratix iv gx and stratix iv gt fpgas offer advanced transceiver capabilities for applications that require reliable  multi gigabit serial data transfer rates of up to gbps 
programmable power technology allows customer designs to meet stringent requirements for both low power and high speed 
arria and arria ii gx mid range  transceiver equipped fpgas our arria product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and enable a simplified transceiver based design for applications requiring high performance data transfer protocols 
arria ii gx fpgas offer best in class signal integrity with data transfer rates of up to gbps  providing designers a high quality and reliable solution for next generation high bandwidth systems across all our markets 
cyclone iii and cyclone iv low cost fpgas our cyclone product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and bring programmable flexibility to cost sensitive applications in all our markets 
our cyclone iii and cyclone iv fpgas use low power process technology to meet market requirements for low power consumption 
additionally  our cyclone iv gx fpgas incorporate up to eight integrated transceivers with data rates up to gbps 
initial shipments of our cyclone iv fpgas are expected in the first quarter of architectural innovation allows cyclone fpgas to combine a low cost structure with abundant device resources  making them ideal for high volume applications 
max ii cplds our max families are instant on  non volatile cplds that are used in high speed glue logic functions for a broad range of electronics equipment 
glue logic permits multiple subsystem components to interact 
our max ii cplds have a revolutionary architecture that reduces costs by or more  consumes less power  and increases performance by as much as over the previous generation max family 
for the most demanding low power and battery operated portable applications  our max iiz cplds offer microamp standby current in ultra small chip packaging 
hardcopy asics our hardcopy asics offer customers a migration path from high density fpga families to a low cost asic for high volume production 
for a given process technology  hardcopy asics deliver nearly the performance of comparable cell based asics  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
in contrast to traditional cell based asics  in which every mask layer is custom and unique to the customer s design  our hardcopy asics share a common set of base layers so only the last few mask layers are customized to implement the customer s design 
by removing the configuration circuitry  programmable routing  and programmability for logic and memory  we reduce the die size and therefore device cost  but deliver functionality  performance and power characteristics that are equivalent to or more favorable than that of an fpga 
as a result  customers get the flexibility and time to market advantages of a high density fpga during the prototyping and early production phases  and then seamlessly convert the design to a hardcopy asic for high volume 
this allows hardcopy asics to be used in high volume cost sensitive applications historically served by traditional cell based asics 
intellectual property cores ip cores are pre verified building blocks that execute system level functions 
customers integrate ip cores in their pld designs with our proprietary development software 
soft ip cores available for use in our devices include our nios series of embedded processors  our portfolio of megacore functions that we license to our customers  and our altera megafunction partners program ampp sm cores  which are pre verified by us and licensed to our customers by third parties 
the nios series of embedded processors use a reduced instruction set computing risc architecture and can be efficiently used in our fpgas and hardcopy asic devices as a cost competitive and flexible alternative to discrete microcontroller solutions 
the nios series of embedded processors compete favorably with many discrete microcontrollers 
with ip cores  system designers can focus more time and energy on improving and differentiating the unique aspects of their system designs  rather than spending time designing common off the shelf functions 
ip cores are essential to providing solutions with higher levels of integration and faster time to market 
today  we offer a broad range of soft ip cores for dsp algorithms  bus interfaces  memory controllers  telecommunications  data communications  microprocessors  and peripherals 
before licensing a soft ip core  customers can download an encrypted soft ip core from our website and verify that it works in their own system designs 
while licensing soft ip cores represents a small portion of our net sales  we believe a broad product offering in this area is necessary to compete with asic and assp vendors as well as other pld vendors 

table of contents development tools to enhance engineering productivity  customers use our proprietary development tools  consisting primarily of the quartus ii software  for design entry  design compilation  design verification  and device programming 
designers can use our development tools on a variety of computing platforms including microsoft windows  unix including solaris and hp ux  and linux operating environments with built in interfaces to many industry standard eda tools offered by cadence design systems  inc  mentor graphics corporation  synopsys  inc  and others 
like ip cores  our development tools generate less than of our net sales  but are a critical and necessary element of our product portfolio because they are used to program our devices and can drive our success in competing for design wins against pld  asic  and assp vendors 
research and development our research and development activities focus primarily on plds  ip cores  development software  and hardware 
we develop these related products in parallel to provide comprehensive design support to customers 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we introduced a number of new families in recent years  including the stratix iv including e  gx and gt  stratix iii  cyclone iv including e and gx  cyclone iii including ls  arria ii gx  max iiz  max ii  hardcopy iv and hardcopy iii device families  as well as major enhancements to our ip core offerings and the quartus ii development platform 
our research and development costs  which are charged to expense as incurred  were million in  million in  and million in patents  trademarks  and licenses we rely on intellectual property laws including patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in products and technology 
activities include patents as of december   we owned more than  united states and foreign patents 
we also had more than  patent applications pending worldwide 
trademarks we use  register  and apply to register certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign countries 
product registrations we file registrations in the united states under the semiconductor chip protection act to protect our chip designs 
when appropriate  we file lawsuits to protect our intellectual property rights 
we have also licensed technology that allows us to design  manufacture  and sell products using certain intellectual property owned by others 
marketing and sales we market our products worldwide through a network of distributors  independent sales representatives  and direct sales personnel 
we add or remove independent sales representatives or distributors from our selling organization as we deem appropriate 
altera distributors in all of the major geographic markets that we serve  we work with distributors to provide demand creation for the broad customer base and order fulfillment services for most of our customers 
these distributors are franchised by component manufacturers to sell a wide variety of products to many customers  and they may sell competing products or solutions 
we have contracts with our distributors that can be terminated by either party upon notice 
all of our distributors stock inventory of our products 
distributors purchase products from us at a set distributor cost denominated in us dollars 
title and risk of loss transfer upon shipment from our stocking locations  which are located in the asia pacific region at the independent subcontractors we employ for test and assembly services or at our warehouse in san jose 
when products are shipped to a distributor  we defer revenue on the sale until the distributor sells the products in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
consequently  the deferred revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded as a current liability under the caption deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
all payments to us are denominated in us dollars 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy  see note significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our sales cycle begins with a design win phase  which can be lengthy  is not always certain and often requires the ongoing participation of sales  engineering  and managerial personnel 
once customer demand has been created and a design is ready to move to prototyping or production  the order fulfillment process begins 
customer orders are primarily processed and fulfilled by a local distributor 
for these orders  our distributors are the legal sellers of the products and therefore bear all risks related to the sale of commercial goods  such as credit loss  inventory shrinkage and theft  and foreign currency fluctuations 
for certain arrangements  altera drop ships products to fulfill orders processed through our primary distributor 
our distributors periodically return certain amounts of unsold product and receive price concessions for unsold product if we reduce prices 
for high volume or competitive situations  we often provide price concessions to our distributors 
typically  a customer purchasing a small quantity of product from a distributor will pay list price 
however  a customer using our products in volume production  purchasing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of units  will often negotiate a substantial price discount from the distributor 
under these circumstances  the distributor will often negotiate and receive a price concession from altera 
these price concessions are negotiated in us dollars 
average aggregate price concessions typically range from to of our list price on an annual basis  depending upon the composition of our sales  volume and factors associated with timing 
this is a standard practice in the semiconductor industry  and we generally provide some level of price concession to every distributor 
our net sales are the sum of our own direct sales to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  plus our distributors resale of altera products 
for  and  worldwide sales through distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
arrow electronics  inc including its affiliates arrow  our largest distributor  accounted for of our net sales in  in  and in our second largest distributor  macnica  inc including its affiliates macnica  located in japan  accounted for of our net sales in  in  and in no other distributor accounted for more than of our net sales in   or see note accounts receivable  net and significant customers to our consolidated financial statements 
altera sales  marketing  and customer support altera has a dedicated global sales and marketing organization to create customer demand and manage our network of distributors and independent sales representatives 
we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts  and provide technical  business  and marketing support to distributors and independent sales representatives 
independent sales representatives  who are mostly located in north america and in select european countries  create demand and provide customer support in a defined territory and often with a defined set of customers 
they do not stock inventory or fulfill orders 
all of our contracts with independent sales representatives can be terminated by either party upon notice 
customer support and service are important to selling and marketing our products 
we provide several levels of technical support  including application assistance  design services  and customer training 
we also publish data sheets and application notes  conduct technical seminars  and provide design assistance to customers via the internet and electronic links 
we have domestic sales offices in numerous major metropolitan areas throughout the united states  and we maintain international sales support offices in bangalore  beijing  cork  chengdu  helsinki  hong kong  london  munich  osaka  ottawa  paris  seoul  shanghai  shenzhen  singapore  stockholm  taipei  tokyo  toronto and turin

backlog our backlog consists mostly of distributor orders  as well as limited oem orders  that are for delivery within the next three months 
our backlog of orders on december   was approximately billion  compared to billion on december  
table of contents historically  backlog is a poor predictor of future sales or customer demand for the following reasons while our backlog increases during periods of high demand and supply constraints  in most cases  purchasers may cancel product orders up to days before the scheduled delivery date without incurring significant cancellation penalties 
our backlog is valued at list price  which in most cases is substantially higher than the price ultimately recognized as revenue 
manufacturing wafer supply die  cut from silicon wafers  are the essential components of all our devices and comprise a significant portion of the total device cost 
our manufacturing strategy is known as a fabless business model since we purchase our silicon wafers from independent semiconductor foundries instead of manufacturing them ourselves 
this strategy allows us to take advantage of these suppliers economies of scale and gives us direct and timely access to advanced process technology 
we purchase nearly all of our silicon wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  an independent semiconductor foundry 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from tsmc 
in the past  we have used other foundry vendors  and we may establish additional foundry relationships as they become economically beneficial or technically necessary 
testing and assembly after wafer manufacturing is completed  each silicon wafer is tested using a variety of test and handling equipment that is owned by us and consigned to our partners 
the vast majority of our silicon wafer testing is performed at tsmc 
our san jose facility is used primarily for new product development 
the wafers are then shipped to various assembly suppliers in asia  where they are divided into good die and encapsulated in packages 
we use a number of independent assembly suppliers to take advantage of their economies of scale and supply flexibility  and to give us direct and timely access to advanced packaging technology 
we purchase almost all of our assembly services from amkor electronics  inc amkor  in korea and the philippines  and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc ase in malaysia and taiwan 
following assembly  each packaged unit completes final testing  marking  and inspection before being packaged for storage as finished goods 
we also use amkor and ase for almost all of our final test and back end operation services 
these suppliers perform final testing using our proprietary test software operating on hardware that is consigned to or owned by our suppliers 
the majority of our inventory  including finished goods  is warehoused in asia at our subcontract test and assembly partners with a smaller portion located at our corporate facility in san jose  california 
these suppliers also ship our products to oems and distributors

risk factors 
the following risk factors  among others that are not presently known or that we currently believe unimportant  could affect our future results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
before you decide to buy  hold  or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider these risks  in addition to the other information contained in this report 
our business  financial condition  and operations results could be seriously harmed if any of the events described here actually occurs 
in that situation  the market price for our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor companies  such as altera  experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability 
the semiconductor industry has experienced economic downturns and business contractions from time to time  such as the downturn 
downturns in the semiconductor industry can be severe and prolonged 
these downturns can result in significant reductions in product demand and excess customer inventories 
during the downturn  general worldwide economic conditions significantly deteriorated due to credit conditions resulting from the recent financial crisis 
it is difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities in this economic environment 
in  we experienced lower sales than in although business conditions improved during the second half of  that trend may not continue 
our ability to predict the quantity and type of products our customers will need in the future is challenging because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management 
these factors could affect the timing of customer orders and the overall level of demand for our products 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success or timing of a customer s product  and because our end markets are highly fragmented we have over  pld customers  our ability to forecast end customer demand is difficult 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell as quickly as estimated  if at all 
as a result we could hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  the disruptions in financial markets may continue to adversely affect the ability of our distributors or their customers original equipment manufacturers or subcontract manufacturers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations  which could adversely affect demand for our products 
our operating cash flows are highly dependent on the continued collection of receivables and our ability to sell inventories 
further declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of our receivables 
in addition to reductions in sales and elevated risk associated with the collection of receivables  our profitability and cash flows may suffer during downturns because we may not be able to reduce costs at the same rate as our sales decline 
as further described below  we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers and to assemble  test and ship our semiconductor products 
the tightening of global credit markets may adversely affect the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for operations 
if our subcontractors capital structures weaken  they may fail to satisfy our demand and our business could be materially disrupted 
if global economic and market conditions remain uncertain or persist  spread or deteriorate further  we could experience a material impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors 
our gross margins may fluctuate due to many factors  including geographic and or market segment pricing mix changes in the mix of our prototyping and production based business competitive pricing dynamics and customer mix various manufacturing cost variables including product yields  wafer prices  package and assembly costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  and absorption of manufacturing overhead additionally  since the majority of our sales are booked and shipped through our distributors within the same quarter  forecasting our gross margins is difficult 

table of contents our failure to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry would adversely affect our financial results and business prospects 
the semiconductor industry  including the pld market  is intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry depends on our ability to provide our customers with solutions providing greater value than those offered by competing programmable logic vendors  such as xilinx and lattice  and other semiconductor companies that indirectly compete with us 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by asic  assp  microcontroller  and digital signal processing dsp vendors  we compete against these vendors 
many of these vendors have substantially more financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we may be unable to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
further  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
in addition  customers may replace one or more of our fpgas with a standard cell asic for cost reduction and that would adversely impact our revenue 
the length of our design in and sales cycles could affect our ability to forecast future sales 
our sales depend on our products being designed into end customers products  and on those products being produced in volume 
our products are very complex  and the time from design in to volume production ranges from six months to three years or more 
from initial product design in to volume production  many factors can affect the timing and or volume of our sales 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive position of our technology  the competitiveness of our end customers products in the markets they serve  our customers financial stability  end customer program delays and cancellations  and our ability to ship products according to customer schedules 
our business is characterized by a general decline in semiconductor product selling prices that may materially and adversely affect our profitability 
the selling prices of our products have decreased over time 
we have offset the selling price decreases by reducing manufacturing costs  improving yields  and increasing unit sales 
however  our ongoing efforts may not be successful or may not keep pace with the anticipated  continued decline in product selling prices  which could ultimately reduce revenues and gross margins 
because we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales  we may be subject to political  economic  and other conditions that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non us laws  regulations and customs 
during  sales outside of the us and canada constituted approximately of our net sales  and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic  market  political  and social conditions in a specific country or region fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates adverse changes in tax laws increased freight costs interruptions in air transportation reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries longer receivable collection periods natural or man made disasters in the countries or regions where we sell our products different labor regulations our business must comply with a variety of foreign laws and take risks associated with legislation and regulations for importing and exporting semiconductor products 
in the future  the united states or other countries may impose quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes  or other charges  restrictions  or trade barriers for the import or export of our products 
we rely heavily on distributors to generate a significant portion of our sales and fulfill our customer orders 
the failure of our distributors to perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales 
worldwide sales through distributors accounted for of our net sales during we rely on many distributors to help us create end customer demand  provide technical support and other value added services to end customers  fill customer orders  and stock our products 
our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party upon notice 
our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions 
lower sales  lower earnings  debt downgrades  the inability to access capital markets  and higher interest rates could potentially affect our distributors operations 

table of contents we are highly dependent on arrow electronics  inc including its affiliates arrow  in many locations across the world  particularly in north america 
during  arrow accounted for approximately of net sales on a worldwide basis  while our next largest distributor  macnica  inc including its affiliates macnica  accounted for approximately of net sales 
as of december   accounts receivable from arrow and macnica individually accounted for and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable 
our ability to add or replace distributors is limited 
our distributors are contracted by altera to perform two primary  yet distinct  functions that are difficult to replace distributors provide logistics support  such as order entry  credit  forecasting  inventory management  and shipment of product  to end customers 
the process of integrating systems to allow for electronic data interchange is complex and can be time consuming 
distributors create demand for our products at the engineering level 
this mandates the training of an extended distributor sales force  as well as hiring and training specialized applications engineers skilled in promoting and servicing products at the engineering level 
in addition  our distributors expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels may not be easily transferable to a new distributor 
also  end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor 
we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
nearly all of our silicon wafers are produced by tsmc in its manufacturing facilities located primarily in taiwan and the us silicon wafer production facilities have a fixed capacity that is allocated solely by our vendors and beyond our direct control 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from our foundry suppliers 
our operations would be disrupted if tsmc ended its relationship with us and we were unable to arrange a satisfactory and cost effective alternative to quickly fulfill customer orders 
to ensure continued wafer supply  we may establish other wafer supply sources as these arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
however  only a few foundry vendors have the capability to manufacture our most advanced products 
if we engage alternative supply sources  we may encounter start up difficulties and incur additional costs 
in addition  shipments could be significantly delayed while these sources are qualified for volume production 
furthermore  because we rely on third party foundries  we have little or no direct control over production costs  delivery schedules  and wafer quality 
we also face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
wafer shortages and or increased wafer and assembly material costs could lower our gross margins  reduce our sales  or otherwise materially disrupt our business 
if market demand for silicon wafers or assembly material suddenly exceeds market supply  our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited 
a shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet product demand 
moreover  silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost 
if we are unable to purchase wafers at favorable prices  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
product manufacturing is complex  and our foundries may not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability that our business requires 
manufacturing our products is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
we depend not only on sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity and wafer prices  but also good production yields the number of good die per wafer and timely wafer delivery to meet customer demand and maintain profit margins 
wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as a result  we may experience problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendor 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin new product production  when we transition to new processes  or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another  or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
as a result of manufacturing defects  tsmc has also occasionally scrapped wafers  resulting in longer manufacturing lead times 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among the various factories used by our wafer suppliers  and we may occasionally experience production delays 
these difficulties and delays can potentially cause significantly higher costs and lower product availability 

table of contents we depend on independent subcontractors  located in asia  to assemble  test  and ship our semiconductor products 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
because we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble  test  and ship our semiconductor products and to provide package piece parts  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels 
we are dependent upon sufficient subcontractor assembly and test capacities  both in raw materials and services  to meet the demand for our own products 
our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors 
if market demand for subcontractor material and services exceeds available supply or if the subcontractors capital structures weaken  we may experience product shortages  quality assurance problems  and or increased manufacturing costs 
conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
the economic  market  social  and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and distributors are located are unpredictable  can be volatile  and can have a significant impact on our business because we may be unable to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner 
market and political conditions  including currency fluctuation  terrorism  political strife  war  labor disruption  and other factors  including natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  tariff  import or export quotas  power and water shortages  or interruption in air transportation  in areas where our independent subcontractors and distributors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
for example  because we rely heavily on tsmc to produce a significant portion of our silicon wafers  earthquakes or other natural disasters in taiwan and asia could limit our wafer supply and thereby harm our business  financial condition  and operational results 
our failure to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 
we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change 
our products are manufactured using a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
our current product development efforts focus on developing new plds  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
our development efforts may impact the timely introduction of competitive new products or product enhancements 
additionally  we may not be successful in developing new products or using and converting established products to new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our current generation product families  the stratix iv including e  gx and gt families  are manufactured on a nanometer process technology  but our next generation product families will be manufactured on smaller circuit geometries we have not used before 
the use of advanced process technology has technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect research and development spending  yields  product costs  and product delivery timeliness 
any prolonged disruption to our global communications infrastructure could impair our ability to plan factory activity and respond to customer demand 
demand for our products is highly volatile  especially at the detailed ordering code level 
to achieve short delivery lead times and superior levels of customer service while maintaining low levels of inventory  we constantly adjust our manufacturing subcontractors production schedules 
we develop and adjust these schedules based on end customer demand as communicated by our distributors and based on our inventory levels  manufacturing cycle times  component lead times  and projected production yields 
we combine and distribute all of this information electronically over a complex global communications network 
our ability to estimate demand and to adjust our production schedules is highly dependent on this network  we have no manual back up 
a prolonged disruption or service failure in a portion of this network would impair our ability to plan factory activity and respond to demand 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we produce highly complex hardware and software products that incorporate leading edge technology 
our pre shipment testing programs may not detect all defects 
because our product warranties against materials and workmanship defects and non conformance to our specifications are for varying lengths of time  we have occasionally been required to replace components or refund the purchase price paid due to product defects 
if the costs for customer or warranty claims increase significantly compared with our historical experience  our revenue  gross margins  and net income may be adversely affected 
for example  if we cannot fix a product defect in a timely manner  we may incur product reengineering expenses  increased inventory costs  or damage to our reputation  any of which could materially affect our revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
our devices are used in automotive  military  aerospace  avionics  medical equipment  and other systems where system failure could cause damage to property or people 
we may receive product liability claims if our devices cause system failures 
based on our historical experience  we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low  but could be higher if both the sales volume in these applications and the frequency of system failures caused by our devices increases 

table of contents our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 
our corporate headquarters in san jose  california is located near major earthquake faults 
some of our international facilities and those of our key suppliers  including tsmc which produces nearly all of our silicon wafers  are also located near major earthquake faults 
any catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  could make it difficult for altera and our independent subcontractors to meet product design deadlines  maintain our records  pay our suppliers  or manufacture or ship our products 
as we carry only limited insurance coverage  any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents  and we do not have coverage for certain losses 
we believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice and economic and availability considerations 
if our insurance coverage is inadequate to protect us against unforeseen catastrophic losses  any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
legislative action in the united states could materially and adversely affect us from a tax perspective 
legislative action may be taken by the us congress which  if ultimately enacted  would adversely affect our effective tax rate and or require us to take further action  at potentially significant expense  to seek to preserve our effective tax rate 
in and  president obama s administration announced budgets  which included proposed future tax legislation that could substantially modify the rules governing the us taxation of certain us affiliates 
these potential changes include  but are not limited to  curbing the deferral of us taxation of certain foreign earnings and limiting the ability to use foreign tax credits 
many details of the proposal remain unknown  and any legislation enacting such modifications would require congressional support and approval 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 
however  if any of these proposals are enacted into law  they could significantly impact our effective tax rate 
the failure of our intellectual property rights to provide meaningful protection from our competitors could harm our competitive position 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright  and mask work laws to protect our intellectual property  proprietary information  and technology rights 
as of december   we owned more than  us patents and foreign patents  and had more than  patents applications pending worldwide 
our patents and patent applications may not protect us from our competition  which may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new patentable technologies that displace our products 
in addition  other parties  including our former employees or consultants  may try to disclose  obtain  or use our proprietary information or technologies without our authorization despite our best efforts at prevention 
if other companies obtain this information or develop similar information or technologies  they may develop products that compete against ours 
moreover  the laws of certain countries where we sell  manufacture  or distribute products may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
even if we spend significant resources and efforts to protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
if others use our proprietary rights  it could materially harm our business and require expensive litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products 
we occasionally receive inquiries about possible patent infringements that may require us to obtain licenses relating to our current or future products 
we may be unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  or the license agreements may have set durations or may not provide complete protection against infringement claims involving all of our current or future products 
if we are sued for patent infringement  the costs and outcome of litigation will be unpredictable and may have a negative impact on our financial results 
intellectual property claims  regardless of their merit  can result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
legal proceedings are also unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control 
if our defense against intellectual property infringement claims is unsuccessful  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or be subject to an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
alternatively  we could be required to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  the success of which may be uncertain 
intellectual property litigation may have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item and the risk factors included in item a of this annual report 
executive overview company and market overview we are a global semiconductor company  serving over  customers within the telecom and wireless  industrial automation  military and auto  networking  computer and storage  and other market segments 
the other market segment includes sub segments of broadcast  consumer  medical and test 
we design  manufacture  and market a variety of products programmable logic devices plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds  are standard semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  that our customers program to perform desired logic functions in their electronic systems 
hardcopy application specific integrated circuit asic devices transition customer designs from high density fpgas to low cost non programmable devices for volume production 
pre defined design building blocks  known as intellectual property ip cores  can be licensed by customers to easily implement standard functions in their pld designs 
proprietary development software  which operates on personal computers and engineering workstations  is used by customers to develop  compile  and verify their designs  and then program their designs into our plds 
in  sales of plds generated of our net sales  with fpga and cpld sales comprising approximately and of our net sales  respectively 
the remainder of our sales is comprised of our hardcopy devices and configuration devices used in conjunction with our fpgas  as well as licensing of ip cores and proprietary development tools 
driving operational excellence since the pld market was created in the s  the financial business models of the leading pld suppliers have generally been favorable when compared to most other semiconductor companies 
fabless strategies  high barriers to entry  and proprietary architectures have helped drive strong financial results for pld suppliers 
as the semiconductor industry and the pld market have matured  revenue growth in the pld segment  while still higher than many other semiconductor segments  has expectedly slowed 
we regularly engage in a strategic review of our business to improve operations and financial returns 
we are focused on maximizing return on invested capital by pursuing greater efficiencies in all aspects of our operations while seeking balance with our commitment to continued investment in advanced technology for the development of new products 
in recent years  we have increased our focus on enhancing our business model to simplify our business processes while also growing pld market share 
we believe that our early and continued focus on cost reduction and productivity enhancement before the business slowdown related to the global financial crisis during and may provide us with some benefits compared to other semiconductor companies 
our ability to maintain investment in the research and development of future products  which has been aided by our early and ongoing cost savings initiatives  is a vital factor for our future earnings growth 
in addition  our prior work in analyzing business processes has not only allowed us to effectively identify and implement simplification and cost reduction initiatives  but the concept of workflow efficiency is an increasingly valued aspect of our business culture 
this work and our evolving culture may be an asset as we navigate our company through the economic downturn 
market opportunity based on publicly available data and information derived from gartner dataquest  we estimate that the pld market was approximately billion in and the accessible asic and assp market was approximately billion 
the total asic and assp market is estimated to be billion  the accessible portion of the asic and assp market excludes cell phones and certain consumer applications including pc related equipment  video games and portable media applications 
we believe that our greatest opportunity for growth is displacing asics and assps 

table of contents for our most current designs  pld process technology is typically two or three process generations more advanced than asic and assp process technology 
as chip manufacturing becomes more advanced  the total cost of chip development increases  reducing the cost advantage of asics and assps 
as a result  some asic and assp suppliers choose to use non leading edge process technology for new designs to reduce development costs 
we believe this has brought us to a tipping point with respect to our opportunity to displace asics and assps 
it is no longer technologically feasible for many asic and assp suppliers to continue to use old process generations for technically advanced systems  and at the same time it is not economically feasible for them to use new generations of technology for low and mid range volume applications 
the process technology gap between plds and asic and assp alternatives will increase over time and  when combined with the traditional pld advantages of greater flexibility  lower development cost  and faster time to market  should drive the accelerated adoption of plds in the years ahead 
we have seen evidence of the tipping point with the introduction of our stratix iv fpga products 
an increasing number of asic and assp opportunities are being displaced by stratix iv fpgas and  to date  the stratix iv family has been the fastest ramping fpga product in the history of the pld industry 
in the initial fifteen months of customer designs  our stratix iv products are well ahead of any previous stratix product generation at the same point in time with respect to design opportunity value and design win value 
in fact  using the initial month benchmark  the value of stratix iv fpga design opportunities has already reached the level that any prior stratix generation attained in its lifetime 
leveraging our global structure we believe that we have opportunities to further expand our position outside of the united states 
our organization and management structure integrates our us and us operations and provides our management team with a global perspective on our markets 
we believe that this infrastructure provides opportunities to develop and commercialize new products that meet global needs and can be rapidly launched in multiple markets 
our global organizational focus should allow us to continue to grow outside of the united states faster than within the united states 
competing for design wins we compete with other pld vendors to displace fixed chip logic alternatives and for market share within the pld market 
competition between pld vendors is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design  when customers select products for use in the customer s electronic system 
because each pld vendor s products are proprietary  the cost to switch plds after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  a design win can provide the pld vendor with a profitable revenue stream through the life of the customer s program 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be two or more years before a customer starts volume production of its system 
typically  the customer selects the pld vendor relatively early in a customer s design process  but it may take several years to complete system design  build prototypes  sample the marketplace for customer acceptance  make modifications  and manufacture in volume 
thus  there is a delay between developing a competitive advantage and experiencing a shift in the pld market  meaning that market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success and timing of customer programs  and because the end markets are highly fragmented we have over  pld customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their own competitive strength in winning designs at a particular point in time 
developing competitive products a pld vendor s ability to secure design wins and to maintain or increase market share is highly dependent on the cost and quality of its products  particularly the effectiveness and reliability of its proprietary development software 
development software  working in tandem with device logic architecture and features  creates the functionality desired by the customer 
as customers gain familiarity with a particular pld vendor s software  they often want to use that same software again in another design  giving that pld vendor a potential advantage as the next system is designed 
we develop our software in parallel with our devices  and there are schedule and integration risks between the two processes 
if we fail to create adequate software to support our new devices as they are introduced  we weaken our competitive position  which can have long lasting effects if customers switch to competing solutions and become less familiar and less skilled with our software 
we focus the majority of our research and development resources on next generation fpgas because increasing our fpga market share is important to our long term growth and profitability 
due to the higher integration density and lower cost per function  the fpga market has outgrown the cpld market in recent years  and industry participants and observers believe this trend will continue 
since the initial introduction of our stratix and cyclone fpga families in  we have introduced several more fpga families in the stratix  cyclone and arria series of products 
as a result of these product introductions  we estimate  based on publicly available data and with information derived from gartner dataquest  that our market share has increased as follows market share pld fpga cpld 
table of contents complementing our stratix fpgas is our hardcopy family of asics 
we first shipped hardcopy devices in  offering customers low cost  non programmable production devices that use our highest density fpgas as an integrated development vehicle 
hardcopy devices are targeted specifically at those applications and customers that have used plds for prototyping and development and traditional cell based asics from other vendors for their volume production needs 
in  our hardcopy asic sales were less than of net sales  and we believe the hardcopy family may increase as a percentage of net sales over the long term 
the availability of a hardcopy conversion path for high density fpga designs is a competitive advantage 
since  we have introduced newer versions of the hardcopy family to support newer generations of fpgas 
our latest generation of hardcopy devices offers transceiver functionality for the first time  thereby increasing the appeal of a hardcopy based solution 
our approach is unique in the industry  but may underperform our expectations 
as we develop new generations of fpgas  we may create parallel hardcopy devices  which would entail ongoing engineering effort and expense 
we have improved our cpld offering by introducing the max ii family in and the max iiz family in max ii cplds offer pricing and features that we believe are competitively attractive  with cost  performance  power consumption  and density that are superior to our previous offerings 
an fpga family typically reaches peak sales four to five years after initial product shipment 
as a result  the stratix ii and cyclone ii families we introduced in  which comprised approximately of our net sales in  may be at or near peak sales 
we believe that the products we introduced from to have yet to reach peak sales  but will eventually experience sales declines 
to improve or even sustain our growth rate  we must successfully introduce successor generations of devices 
the degree to which other pld vendors improve the competitiveness and execution of their products may impair our ability to improve our growth rate 
within the next several quarters  we plan to ship newer fpga families using more advanced production techniques that will further improve product performance and lower cost 
our foundry partner  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  will manufacture these die using production processes that are new to the industry 
given the extreme complexity of semiconductor fabrication  tsmc may encounter difficulties that could delay our product launch or limit supply so that we would be unable to meet customer commitments 
we may discover manufacturing errors after we begin shipping  which would harm customer relations and cause us to incur additional unforeseen costs 
simultaneous introduction of new pld architectures and ramp of new technology processes are inherently risky 
diagnosing failures  identifying root causes  and implementing corrective actions in a production wafer fabrication facility are expensive and time consuming 
we may not successfully commercialize our new products  or our new products may not enable us to maintain or increase market share 
some of our competitive offerings may be offered later than the competition and it is possible that our competitive offerings will be less effective  thus weakening our market share 
it is also possible that our primary competitor may have secured design wins that  when they enter production  will reverse some of our recent market share gains 
our main competitor is larger in size with more sales  and research and development resources  and we may not enjoy the same success that we saw with previous fpga generations 
customer intimacy and cost optimized product strategy we rely on customer interaction to gain product development insights  and we make development decisions years before a product begins to ship 
we have been able to gain market share on the strength of our product definition methodology and the successful rollout of new products 
however  because our products are complex  we assume considerable risk with every new product introduction 
if we misinterpret customer requirements or demand changes  our products may become uncompetitive 
our competitors are knowledgeable and skilled and  in some cases  larger than we are 
since it is difficult to gauge competitive success until the design win phase is well underway  it may be too late to make changes to a generation of products if those products are uncompetitive 
if a product generation is uncompetitive and we lose market share  regaining customers is very challenging 
since and following the semiconductor industry correction early in this decade  our strategy to displace asics and assps has included the development of cost optimized products 
these products have contributed to growth across all of our market segments and are increasingly being used by our customers in production volumes  not just as prototyping or low volume solutions 
production volumes vary by industry  but customers that buy our products in production volumes expect lower unit pricing 
consequently  our business today is subject to a wider gross margin range than the gross margin range associated with a less diverse  largely prototyping business 
depending on the market segment mix  our gross margins can vary more quarter to quarter than in the past 
since the majority of our business books and ships in the same quarter  forecasting our gross margins has also become more difficult 
while we believe that growth will occur across all of our market segments  our gross margins could move up or down if the mix shifts between smaller  higher margin segments versus larger  lower margin segments 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires our management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we sell more than of our products to distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
in most cases  sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns 
we defer recognition of revenue and costs until the products are resold by the distributor 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us with periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that reported data is accurate 
at times  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
this reconciliation process requires us to estimate the amount of in transit shipments net of in transit returns to our distributors 
in transit days can significantly vary among geographies and individual distributors 
we also apply judgment when estimating the total value of price concessions earned by our distributors but not claimed by the end of the reporting period 
this is because there is a time lag between the price concessions earned and claimed by the distributors for any underlying resale of products 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  and net income 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost determined on a first in first out basis approximated by standard cost or market 
we routinely compare our inventory against projected demand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories as necessary 
we establish provisions for inventory for technological obsolescence or if inventory levels on hand are in excess of projected customer demand 
the recording of such provisions results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of goods sold 
historically  it has been difficult to forecast customer demand 
actual demand may materially differ from our projected demand  and this difference could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory or a benefit from inventory previously written down 
many of the orders we receive from our customers and distributors request delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times less than our manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to our customers  we build and stock a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may not materialize 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we generally allow customers to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
thus  even product built to satisfy specific customer orders may not ultimately be required to fulfill customer demand 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances  when necessary  to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
if  in the future  we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap  whereby we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the merits of the position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of us gaap and complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations 
if the payment ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the tax liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result

table of contents results of operations on september   our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the friday nearest december to december of each year 
this change was effective beginning with our fiscal year and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any previously reported period

sales by product category we classify our products into three categories new  mainstream  and mature and other products 
the composition of each product category is as follows new products include the stratix ii and gx  stratix iii  stratix iv including e  gx and gt  arria  arria ii gx  cyclone ii  cyclone iii including ls  max ii and hardcopy devices  mainstream products include the stratix and gx  cyclone  and max a devices  and mature and other products include the classic  max  max a  max b  max s  max  flex series  apex series  mercury  excalibur  configuration and other devices  intellectual property cores  and software and other tools 
the product categories above have been assigned based upon the approximate relative life cycle stages of our products 
the product categories compositions are adjusted approximately every two to three years 
new products are primarily comprised of our most advanced products 
customers typically select these products for their latest generation of electronic systems 
demand is generally driven by prototyping and production needs 
mainstream products are somewhat older products that are generally no longer design win vehicles 
demand for these products is driven by customers later stage production based needs 
mature products are yet older products with demand generated by the oldest customer systems still in production 
this category also includes sales of software  intellectual property  and other miscellaneous devices 

table of contents net sales by product category were as follows annual growth rate new mainstream mature and other net sales sales by market segment during  we modified market segment classifications to more closely align with end customer products and product requirements 
in addition  we refined our methodology for assigning net sales to market segments to better align distributor price discounts with end customer markets 
accordingly  prior year data has been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation 
the following market segment data is derived from data that is provided to us by our distributors and end customers 
with a broad base of customers  who in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple market segments  the assignment of net sales to a market segment requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
as such  actual results may differ from those reported 
net sales by market segment were as follows annual growth rate telecom wireless industrial automation  military auto networking  computer storage other net sales in  net sales in the telecom wireless segment advanced versus  primarily as a result of strong sales to wireless equipment customers  including those selling second and third generation equipment in asia 
net sales to end customers outside the telecom wireless segment declined for versus  primarily as a result of lower demand resulting from the worldwide economic downturn 
sales in the telecom and wireless  and industrial automation  military and auto segments  each advanced by in compared to  primarily as a result of strong traction in asic and assp replacement 
additionally  sales in these market segments were lower due to wide spread customer inventory reduction programs 
sales in the other segment declined in compared to  primarily due to customer program transitions and a slowdown in the world wide economy 
sales of fpgas and cplds our plds consist of field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  and complex programmable logic devices  or cplds 
fpgas consist of our stratix  cyclone  arria  apex  flex  and acex series  as well as our excalibur and mercury families 
cplds consist of our max  max ii  and classic families 
our other products consist of hardcopy  hardcopy ii and other masked programmed logic devices  configuration devices  software and other tools and ip cores collectively  other products 

table of contents net sales of fpgas and cplds  and other products were as follows annual growth rate fpga cpld other products net sales sales by geography the following table is based on the geographic location of the original equipment manufacturers or the distributors who purchased our products 
the geographic location of distributors may be different from the geographic location of the ultimate end users 
net sales by geography were as follows annual growth rate north america asia pacific europe japan net sales price concessions and product returns from distributors we sell the majority of our products to distributors worldwide at a list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated prices based on a variety of factors  including customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive differentiation 
the majority of our distributors sales to their customers are priced at a discount from our list price 
under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of its original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed and we validate the distributor s resale information  including end customer  device  quantity and price  against the distributor price concession that we have approved in advance 
to receive price concessions  distributors must submit the price concession claims to us for approval within days of the resale of the product to an end customer 
primarily because of the uncertainty related to the final price  we defer revenue recognition on sales to distributors until our products are sold from the distributor to the end customer  which is when our price is fixed or determinable 
accordingly  these pricing uncertainties impact our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
total price concessions earned by distributors were billion and billion for and  respectively 
see note deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors to our consolidated financial statements 
average aggregate price concessions typically range from to of our list price on an annual basis  depending upon the composition of our sales  volume and factors associated with timing of shipments to distributors or payment of price concessions 
our distributors have certain rights under our contracts to return defective  overstocked  obsolete and discontinued products 
our stock rotation program generally allows distributors to return unsold product to altera  subject to certain contract limits  based on a percentage of sales occurring over various periods prior to the stock rotation 
products resold by the distributor to end customers are no longer eligible for return  unless specifically authorized by us 
in addition  we generally warrant our products against defects in material  workmanship and non conformance to our specifications 
returns from distributors totaled million and million for and  respectively 
see note deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors to our consolidated financial statements 
gross margin gross margin percentage 
table of contents gross margin rates are heavily influenced by both market segment mix and the timing of material cost improvements 
gross margin percentages decreased in compared to primarily as a result of a disproportionate decrease in revenue from our smaller  higher margin customer base 
we also experienced a more pronounced decline in our highest margin market segments 
while these variables will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis  we continue to target a gross margin over the long term 
we believe the gross margin target affords us the right mix of growth opportunities across all served markets 
gross margin percentages increased in compared to primarily as a result of material cost improvements  as well as favorable market segment mix 
stock based compensation expense included in cost of sales did not have a significant impact on our gross margin in  or research and development expense research and development expense includes costs for compensation and benefits including stock based compensation  development masks  prototype wafers  and depreciation and amortization 
these expenditures are for the design of new pld and asic families  the development of process technologies  new package technology  software to support new products and design environments  and ip cores 
we will continue to make significant investments in the development of new products and focus our efforts on the development of new programmable logic devices that use advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes  as well as related development software 
we are currently investing in the development of future silicon products  as well as our quartus ii software  our library of ip cores  and other future products

stock based compensation decreased by million in compared to compensation and benefits expenses decreased by million in compared to the decrease in compensation and benefits is the net result of a decrease of million  resulting from our cost reduction efforts described above  substantially offset by an increase of million in variable compensation expense associated with operating results 
the absence in of million of restructuring charges recognized in was substantially offset by a million increase in non recurring charges related to the elimination of certain external sales representatives and employee termination costs 
deferred compensation plan we allow our us based officers and director level employees to defer a portion of their compensation under the altera corporation non qualified deferred compensation plan nqdc plan 
since the inception of the nqdc plan  we have not made any contributions to the nqdc plan and we have no commitments to do so in the future 
there are no nqdc plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments 
investment income or loss earned by the nqdc plan is recorded as gain loss on deferred compensation plan securities in our consolidated statements of income 
we reported losses gains on nqdc plan assets of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts resulted from the overall market performance of the underlying securities 
the investment loss gain also represents a decrease increase in the future payout to employees and is recorded as compensation expense benefit deferred compensation plan in our consolidated statements of income 
the compensation expense benefit associated with our deferred compensation plan obligations is offset by losses gains from related securities 
the net effect of the investment income or loss and related compensation expense or benefit has no impact on our income before income taxes  net income  or cash balances 
see note employee benefits plans to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our nqdc plan 
interest income and other interest income and other consists mainly of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
the year over year decrease in interest income and other was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower returns on our money market funds  partially offset by the effect of an increase in invested balances 

table of contents interest expense the decrease of million in interest expense from to was due primarily to the decrease in of the libor rate  which represents the principal basis of our interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our long term credit facility 
the increase of million in interest expense from to was due primarily to the increase in weighted average outstanding borrowings under our long term credit facility  partially offset by changes in the libor rate 
see note long term credit facility to our consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense our effective tax rate reflects the impact of significant amounts of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates substantially below the us statutory rate 
our effective tax rates were for  for and for the significant net increase in our effective tax rate in was primarily due to the impact of two discrete income tax expense charges 
first  on may   the ninth circuit court of appeals issued its ruling in the case of xilinx  inc v 
commissioner xilinx case  holding that stock based compensation was required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a us company and its foreign subsidiary 
as a result of the ruling in the xilinx case  we recognized a discrete income tax expense charge of million during on january   the court withdrew its prior opinion in the xilinx case 
at this point  further actions by the court remain unknown and there has been no conclusive action with respect to the ultimate treatment of stock based compensation in transfer pricing arrangements between a us company and its foreign subsidiary 
as such  no adjustments to our income tax expense have been made 
secondly  on february   california enacted changes in tax laws that are expected to have a beneficial impact on our effective tax rate beginning in as a result  we revalued our state deferred tax assets that are expected to reverse after the effective date of the change and recognized discrete income tax expense charges of million during these adjustments were partially offset by proportionately higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates below the us statutory tax rate 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
restructuring charges during  we announced a net reduction of approximately positions 
we incurred restructuring related charges of approximately million in the charges were comprised of employee severance costs of approximately million  charges related to the termination of certain external sales representatives of approximately million and operating lease impairments of approximately million 
as a result of the workforce reduction  we expect to achieve annual net cost savings of approximately million 
no significant restructuring activities were initiated in in  we announced a restructuring of our operations in order to lower our overall cost structure and enhance near and long term profitability of the company 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of jobs and the consolidation of excess facilities resulting in the restructuring of our office leases in san diego and santa cruz  california  ottawa  canada  and hong kong 
annual cost savings from the restructuring action approximate million 
the restructuring charges are included in our consolidated statements of income as follows in thousands cost of sales research and development expense selling  general  and administrative expense we anticipate that the remaining restructuring obligations of million as of december  will be substantially paid prior to december  see note restructuring charges to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents financial condition  liquidity  credit facility and capital resources overview we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations 
we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility  which has been used primarily to fund common stock repurchases and to realign our capital structure 
as of december   we have borrowed million under the facility 
the remaining capacity of million available under the facility also represents a source of liquidity 
the terms of the facility require compliance with certain financial and non financial covenants 
financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios related to interest coverage and financial leverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
see note long term credit facility to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the facility 
we use cash from operations and available amounts under the facility for repurchases of our common stock  cash dividends  and capital expenditures 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our current available sources of funds including cash  cash equivalents  and the facility  plus anticipated cash generated from operations  will be adequate to finance our operations  stock repurchases  cash dividends and capital expenditures for at least the next year 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million during the year ended december  the change in cash and cash equivalents for  and was as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents total cash and cash equivalents accounted for and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
operating activities in  our operating activities provided million in cash  primarily attributable to net income of million  adjusted for non cash stock based compensation expense of million net of related tax effects  depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income tax benefit of million and a non cash gain on the substantive termination of our retiree medical plan of million 
significant changes in working capital accounts excluding cash and cash equivalents included a million increase in accounts receivable  net  a million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities  a million increase in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  a million decrease in inventories  a million decrease in other assets and a million increase in income tax payable 
our sales to distributors are primarily made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns  and we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable at the list selling price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors in the liability section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
accordingly  increases in accounts receivable  net associated with higher billings are generally offset by corresponding increases in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
however  timing differences between gross billings  advances to distributors  discounts earned  collections  revenue recognition and changes in the mix of sales to oems and distributors may result in a temporary interruption to the normal relationship between these two accounts 
the million increase in accounts receivable  net  principally related to increased gross billings to distributors and oems associated with an upward trend in demand for our products in december compared with december the million increase in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors was not as significant an increase as was experienced in accounts receivable  net  from the increased gross billings  due to the timing factors as discussed above 
as previously mentioned  gross billings were significantly higher in december than in december  but were outpaced by sell through to end customers when comparing the same periods  thus lessening the impact of the increase in gross billings on deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
another contributing factor was a significant decrease in advances to distributors 
repayments of advances by distributors primarily resulted from changes in distributor working capital requirements and changes in the terms of certain distributor funding arrangements 
see note deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the million decrease in inventories resulted from proactive management of inventory levels  primarily in work in process inventory  and the effects of increased sales out volume at the end of the million decrease in other assets is primarily due to million in repayments of advances from distributors made in previous periods to  in substance  finance distributors accounts receivable and inventory 
the repayment of advances resulted from changes in distributor working capital requirements and changes in the terms of certain distributor funding arrangements 
see note deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
the million increase in income tax payable is primarily due to taxes accrued on our income before income taxes and the recognition of a discrete income tax expense charge of million as a result of the ruling in the xilinx case 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
in our operating activities provided million in cash  primarily attributable to net income of million  adjusted for non cash stock based compensation expense of million net of related tax effects  and depreciation and amortization of million 
significant changes in working capital accounts excluding cash included a million decrease in accounts receivable  net  substantially offset by a million decrease in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  a million increase in inventories  and a million increase in other assets  net 
investing activities cash used for investing activities in primarily consisted of net purchases of deferred compensation plan securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
we completed construction of a new office building in penang  malaysia and incurred total capital expenditures of million  which were principally incurred in cash provided by investing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from the maturities and sales of available for sale investments of million and sale of land for million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
capital expenditures primarily reflect million of non recurring expenditures associated with the construction of a new office building in penang  malaysia 
as of december   we no longer held any available for sale investments 
financing activities cash used for financing activities in primarily consisted of cash dividend payments of million  principal payments on capital lease obligations of million and minimum statutory withholding for vested restricted stock units of million  partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock to employees through our employee stock plans 
cash used for financing activities in primarily consisted of repurchases of our common stock of million  cash dividend payments of million  principal payments on capital lease obligations of million and minimum statutory withholding for vested restricted stock units of million  partially offset by proceeds from the facility of million and million from the issuance of common stock to employees through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
our dividend policy could be impacted in the future by  among other items  future changes in our cash flows from operations and our capital spending needs such as those relating to research and development  investments and acquisitions  common stock repurchases  and other strategic investments 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of december   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations wafer purchase obligations long term credit facility interest on long term credit facility obligations under service award program total contractual cash obligations we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through rental expense under all operating leases amounted to million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order materials and services from these subcontractors well in advance  and we are obligated to pay for the materials once they are completed 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials in interest is based on the outstanding credit facility balance and rate in effect as of december  the contractual amounts to be paid are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the libor rate used in the calculation of the future interest payments is based on rates in effect as of december  
future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid 
we offer to our u 
s and non us employees participation in the service award program sap 
the sap provides employees with one to four weeks of additional paid vacation upon their attainment of five  ten  fifteen  twenty and twenty five year service anniversaries 
see note employee benefits plans to our consolidated financial statements 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as income tax payable non current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
in addition to the above obligations  in the normal course of business  we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments pursuant to such agreements have not been material 
we believe that any future payments required pursuant to such agreements would not be significant to our consolidated financial condition or operating results 
impact of foreign currency and inflation we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars 
for us subsidiaries and branches  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and the impact of the remeasurement of local currency assets and liabilities into us dollars for  or was not significant 
during  we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes related to the construction cost for our new building in penang  malaysia 
as of december  all forward contracts had matured 
the realized loss from the settlement of the forward contracts was million for we did not enter into any forward contracts in or we do not enter into foreign exchange transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
common stock repurchases we repurchase shares under our stock purchase program announced on july   which has no specified expiration 
no existing repurchase plans or programs have expired  nor have we decided to terminate any repurchase plans or programs prior to expiration 
since the inception of our stock repurchase program through december   our board of directors has authorized million shares for repurchase and we have repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of billion 
as of december   million shares remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program

in addition  we repurchased shares of our common stock under the guidelines of sec rule b off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
subsequent events we evaluated subsequent events through february  when the financial statements were issued 
on january   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  on january   our board of directors approved a million share increase to the number of shares authorized for repurchase under our share repurchase program 
new accounting pronouncements accounting standards adopted in fair value measurements and disclosures in august  the fasb issued guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value 
the guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  an entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset or  if unavailable  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar assets when traded as assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
our investment strategy is focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements 
our exposure to market risk as a result of changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents  certain interest rate sensitive assets held under the nqdc plan and our long term credit facility 
our nqdc plan assets include holdings of various issuers  types and maturity dates 
the market value of these investments on any given day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
the actual impact on the fair value of the portfolio in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
our consolidated operating results are affected by  among other factors  interest income on our cash equivalents 
if the interest rate declines  our consolidated operating results may be negatively impacted 

table of contents in addition to our cash flows from operations  we derive our liquidity from our long term credit facility the facility 
our total borrowings under the facility as of december  were million 
borrowings under this facility bear a variable interest rate at either a eurodollar rate libor or a prime rate  at our option  plus an applicable margin based upon certain financial ratios  determined and payable quarterly 
the interest rate as of december  was libor plus 
in addition  we pay a facility fee on the entire facility 
this facility fee varies with certain financial ratios and was as of december  our consolidated operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on the facility in any given period 
due to the variable interest rate on the facility  the fair value of the facility would not likely be materially affected by any future changes in interest rates 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk inherent in the marketable equity securities held in our nqdc plan 
a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of these equity securities would not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk we have international operations and incur expenditure in currencies other than us dollars 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility  resulting from foreign currency transaction gains and losses and remeasurement of local currency assets and liabilities into us dollars  has been insignificant 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates in effect at december   the resulting transaction gains or losses and the effects of remeasurement would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows
