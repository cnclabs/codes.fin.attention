the company follows  share based payment  now codified within fasc compensation stock compensation  which establishes standards surrounding the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
under fasc  we recognize an expense for the fair value of our outstanding stock options as they vest  whether held by employees or others 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
this guidance allows companies  in certain circumstances  to utilize a simplified method in determining the expected term of stock option grants when calculating the compensation expense to be recorded under fasc compensation stock compensation 
the simplified method can be used after december  only if a company s stock options exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected option term 
in and  we utilized the simplified method to determine the expected option term  based upon the vesting and original contractual terms of the option

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we apply fasc the temporary differences included therein are attributable to differing methods of reflecting depreciation and stock based compensation for financial statement and income tax purposes

in addition  we own other patents that we believe are valuable in limited product lines  but not material to our success or competitiveness in general 
there are no capitalized costs of such patents

in connection with the purchase and expansion of the alabama facility  we closed on industrial development bonds during the proceeds were utilized for both the repayment of certain advances used to purchase the alabama facility and to expand such facility for our future needs 
during july  we completed a second industrial development bond financing aggregating million through the city of montgomery  alabama 
such transaction funded an approximate  square foot addition to the manufacturing facility as well as the remaining machinery and equipment additions required therein 
this project was substantially completed during 
table of contents in order to market the industrial development bonds idb s at favorable rates  we obtained a substitute irrevocable letter of credit for the issue and a new irrevocable letter of credit for the issue 
renewable annually  we are required to maintain a stipulated level of working capital  a designated maximum debt to tangible ratio  and a required debt service coverage ratio 
such letters of credit are secured by a first priority mortgage on the underlying alabama facility and equipment 
in the first quarter of  both idb s were tendered 
as of december   the bonds have not been remarketed reference subsequent events for update 
the bonds interest rate is the prime rate 
principal and interest are payable quarterly 
we believe current operations are sufficient to meet these obligations 
the bonds maturity dates are march and july for the and series bonds 
in september and october both bond issues were tendered due to the volatility of the credit markets  remarketed and again tendered in february we are involved in making sales in the canadian market and must deal with the currency fluctuations of the canadian currency

in the year ended december  the company recorded approximately  in foreign currency translation adjustments decreasing shareholders equity by  as a result of the weakening of the canadian dollar in relationship to the us dollar  in the conversion of the company s canadian subsidiary balance sheet to us dollars 
during the past few years  we have introduced various new products to our customers 
at times this has required us to carry greater amounts of overall inventory and has resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of such inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases can continue to be provided by operations and current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are petroleum chemical based and commodity chemicals that are subject to fluctuating prices 
the cost of petroleum and related products  major components in many of our products  which were already in an increasing cost spiral  became even more unstable in the practical dynamics of our business do not afford us the same pricing flexibility with our customers  available to our suppliers 
we cannot as immediately as our suppliers pass along the price increases to our national retailers and distributors 
as of december  and through the date hereof  we did not and do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  nor do we have any other present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
in addition  except for our need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  we know of no trend  additional demand  event  or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way
