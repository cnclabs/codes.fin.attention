item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information about the acquisition of aes 
we operate our business in two segments  equipment leasing equipment leasing and equipment manufacturing 
the equipment manufacturing segment is conducted by our seamap subsidiaries and  therefore  is referred to in this form k as our seamap segment 
for additional information about our business segments  including related financial information  see note to our consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
we lease and sell geophysical and other equipment used primarily by seismic data acquisition contractors to perform seismic data acquisition surveys on land  in transition zones marsh and shallow water areas and marine areas 
we conduct our operations on a worldwide basis and believe that we are the world s largest independent lessor of seismic equipment 
we believe that our competitors  in general  have neither as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool as we do  nor similar exclusive lease referral agreements with seismic equipment suppliers 
prior to the fall of  we had experienced an extended period of growth in our business  as had most businesses involved in providing seismic related goods and services 
this growth was  we believe  driven primarily by worldwide oil and gas exploration activity  which was in turn driven by the demand for oil and gas and historically high prices for oil and natural gas 
with the global economic and financial crisis that arose in the fall of  we saw demand for our products decline  especially within certain markets such as north america and the commonwealth of independent states cis  which consists of former soviet republics 
the onslaught of the global recession and the resulting decline in demand for oil and gas  coupled with a relatively high supply of those commodities  resulted in a dramatic decline in the price for oil and natural gas 
this  we believe  resulted in a dramatic slow down in oil and gas exploration activity and  therefore  a decline in demand for seismic related goods and services 
in recent months  there have been indications of renewed oil and gas exploration activity  although we believe the extent of this improvement remains uncertain 
the price for oil has recovered  although not to the levels seen in natural gas prices  while recently higher than the lows seen during  remain significantly depressed from levels 
while the oil and gas industry has been  and we expect will be  subject to significant cyclicality  we believe that our business will benefit from a long term demand for oil and gas 
our equipment is utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world  which are described in item business customers  sales  backlog and marketing 
we lease seismic equipment worldwide  and  on occasion  sell new or used seismic equipment through mii in huntsville  texas and its branch operations in colombia and peru  and through mcl in calgary  alberta 
mse  from its location in ufa  bashkortostan  russia  leases seismic equipment primarily in the russian federation and the cis 
sap  from its location in brisbane  australia  leases seismic equipment in australia and other locations within the pacific rim and also sells new seismic  oceanographic and hydrographic equipment throughout the pacific rim 
seamap uk  located in somerset  united kingdom and seamap singapore  located in singapore  design  manufacture and sell marine seismic equipment throughout the world 

table of contents we own a variety of technologically advanced equipment acquired from the leading seismic manufacturers 
our lease pool includes many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition  including various electronic components of land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems  geophones and cables  earth vibrators  peripheral equipment  survey and other equipment 
the majority of our seismic equipment lease pool is provided by two manufacturers  the sercel subsidiaries of compagnie generale de geophysique veritas sercel and cgv  respectively and ion geophysical corporation ion 
we believe that the majority of the advanced seismic data acquisition systems in use worldwide are either sercel or ion systems 
at january   approximately of our equipment lease pool  on a cost basis  consisted of seismic recording channels and related equipment  with the remainder consisting of geophones  compressors  energy source controllers and other peripheral equipment 
for the past several years  we have had a series of supply and exclusive lease referral agreements with sercel  which we believe have provided us with certain competitive advantages  primarily due to preferential pricing and expedited delivery arrangements under the agreements 
under these agreements  we have been the exclusive worldwide short term leasing representative for certain products 
in september  we renewed our agreement with sercel 
we lease our equipment on a short term basis  generally for two to six months  to seismic contractors who need additional capacity to complete a seismic survey 
certain equipment that is used in vertical seismic profiling or downhole operations is generally leased to oil field service companies and generally for shorter periods of one to two weeks 
short term leasing agreements enable our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies 
a typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys 
our customers may lease a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crew s capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew 
demand for short term seismic equipment leases is affected by many factors  including i the highly variable size and technological demands of individual seismic surveys  ii seasonal weather patterns and sporadic demand for seismic surveys in certain regions  iii the term of the lease and iv the cost of seismic equipment 
we believe these factors allow seismic contractors to use short term seismic equipment leasing as a cost effective alternative to purchasing additional equipment 
our equipment lease rates vary according to an item s expected useful life  utilization  acquisition cost and the term of the lease 
sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
mii and mcl also sell a broad range of used seismic equipment on a worldwide basis 
seamap designs  manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic  hydrographic and offshore industries 
seamap s primary products include the gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources  and the buoylink rgps tracking system  which is used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers 
business strategy our business strategy is to meet the needs of the seismic industry by leasing a wide range of equipment and to provide technologically advanced solutions for marine seismic applications 
to accomplish this  we have identified the following major objectives provide a technologically advanced seismic equipment lease pool 
we intend to maintain the size and diversity of our equipment lease pool 
we believe that the availability of a large and diverse seismic equipment lease pool encourages seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers to lease  rather than purchase  such equipment  due to the capital and operating efficiencies provided by short term leases 
continue to expand international operations 
we intend to continue to expand our international leasing activities in new geographic areas  including the cis  south america  europe  the middle east and north africa 
growth within the cis has been abated by the global economic and financial crisis  however  we believe this to be a temporary situation and that this area presents long term growth opportunities 
we believe there are significant opportunities to continue to expand our international leasing and sales activities 
we believe that we can conduct business in wide ranging geographic areas from our existing facilities 

table of contents however  for legal  tax or operational reasons  we may decide in the future to establish facilities in additional locations 
we generally expect to establish any such facilities through a green field approach  but we may consider making selective acquisitions from time to time 
maintain alliances with major seismic equipment manufacturers 
our relationships with leading seismic equipment manufacturers  particularly sercel  allow us to expand our equipment lease pool through favorable pricing and delivery terms 
we believe these relationships provide a competitive advantage 
pursue additional business development opportunities 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business activities within the oil service industry  particularly in the seismic sector 
these opportunities could include the introduction of new products or services or the acquisition of existing businesses 
seismic technology and the oil service industry seismic surveys are a principal source of information used by oil and gas companies to identify geological conditions that are favorable for the accumulation of oil and gas and to evaluate the potential for successful drilling  development and production of oil and gas 
seismic technology has been used by the oil and gas industry since the s  and has advanced significantly with improvements in computing and electronic technologies 
beginning in the early s  the oil and gas industry significantly expanded its use of d seismic data 
d seismic data provides a more comprehensive subsurface image and is believed to have contributed to improved drilling success rates  particularly in mature oil and gas basins such as those in north america 
additionally  d seismic data continues to be used in many areas where d data acquisition is cost prohibitive or logistical access is limited 
oil and gas exploration companies utilize seismic data generated from the use of digital seismic systems and peripheral equipment in determining optimal locations for drilling oil and gas wells  in the development of oil and gas reserves and in reservoir management for the production of oil and gas 
a complete digital seismic data acquisition system generally consists of i a central electronics unit that records and stores digital data ceu  ii seismic recording channel boxes that contain from one to eight seismic channels channel boxes  iii geophones  or seismic sensors  iv energy sources including dynamite  air guns or earth vibrators that create the necessary acoustic wave to be recorded  v cables that transmit digital seismic data from the channel boxes to the ceu  vi geographic survey equipment  vii drilling equipment used in the seismic survey and viii other peripheral  or accessory  equipment 
in certain applications  specialized seismic recording devices are deployed vertically within a well bore 
multiple recording channels  or levels are generally deployed within a given well and are referred to as downhole or vsp vertical seismic profiling tools 
these applications are used to provide additional data points in a traditional seismic survey  to monitor and analyze reservoir properties  to monitor and analyze fluid treatment operations  as well as a variety of other uses 
in seismic data acquisition  an acoustic wave is generated at or below the earth s surface through the discharge of compressed air  the detonation of small explosive charges or the use of large mechanical vibrators 
as the acoustic wave travels through the earth  it is partially reflected by the underlying rock layers and the reflected energy is captured by sensors  such as geophones  which are situated at intervals along paths from the point of acoustical impulse 
the resulting signals are then transmitted to the channel boxes  which convert the signals from analog to digital data and transmit this data via cable to the ceu 
the ceu stores the seismic data on magnetic tape  disk or other recording media for processing 
the digital data is then input into a specialized seismic processing system that uses sophisticated computer software programs to enhance the recorded signal and produce an image of the subsurface strata 
by interpreting seismic data  oil and gas exploration companies create detailed maps of exploration prospects and oil and gas reservoirs 
historically  a d seismic survey was the standard data acquisition technique used to map geologic formations over a broad area 
d seismic data can be visualized as a single vertical plane of subsurface information 
data gathered from a d seismic survey is best visualized as a cube of information that can be sliced into numerous planes  providing different views of a geologic structure with much higher resolution than is available with traditional d seismic survey techniques 
d seismic surveys generally require a larger amount of equipment than d surveys 
by using a greater number of channels and flexible configuration  d seismic data provides more 
table of contents extensive and detailed information regarding the subsurface geology than d data 
as a result  d data allows the geophysicists interpreting the data to more closely select the optimal location of a prospective drill site or define an oil and gas reservoir 
in the exploration and development process  oil and gas companies establish requirements for seismic data acquisition programs based on their technical objectives 
because of the expense associated with drilling oil and gas wells  decisions regarding whether or where to drill are critical to the overall process 
since d seismic data increases drilling success rates and reduces costs  we believe that d seismic surveys are now predominant 
as a result of the increasing requirements for this higher resolution data  which in turn requires additional channels to collect and transmit data  seismic data acquisition systems have been expanding in size during the past several years 
industry advances include the use of high resolution d  three component geophones d c  which enhance the d image of the sub surface  and time lapse d seismic techniques  where surveys are periodically reacquired to allow the monitoring of producing oil and gas fields for optimal production and reserve recovery 
these and other technical advances have contributed to increased drilling success rates and reduced oil and gas finding costs 
with the expanded use of seismic technology  particularly d seismic surveys  the size of data acquisition surveys has increased substantially in the past several years 
demand for higher resolution data  larger surveys and more rapid completion of such surveys now requires seismic contractors to use data acquisition systems with a greater number of seismic recording channels 
additionally  the size of seismic surveys varies significantly  requiring frequent changes in the configuration of equipment and crews used for seismic surveys 
as a result of these changes  the number of seismic survey channels has increased from smaller d surveys  which typically averaged channels  to larger d surveys  which today average more than  channels and sometimes use as many as  channels 
we believe that many seismic contractors will continue to meet changes in equipment needs by leasing incremental equipment to expand crew size as necessary  thereby reducing the substantial capital expenditures required to purchase such equipment 
seismic surveys utilizing d  d or d techniques require essentially the same equipment 
the manner in which the equipment is deployed and the resulting data analyzed differs  however 
accordingly  our equipment can generally be utilized in d  d and d seismic surveys 
since d and d seismic surveys generally utilize significantly more equipment than d seismic surveys  the potential to lease our seismic equipment has increased from earlier periods 
business and operations equipment leasing 
we own a comprehensive lease pool of seismic equipment for short term leasing to our customers  who are primarily seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers in the case of downhole equipment 
we lease this equipment multiple times until the end of its useful life or its sale 
our equipment leasing services generally include the lease of the various components of seismic data acquisition systems and related equipment to meet a customer s job specifications 
these specifications frequently vary as to the number of required recording channels  geophones  energy sources eg  earth vibrators and other equipment 
our customers generally lease seismic equipment to supplement their own inventory of recording channels and related equipment 
our land equipment lease pool includes a total of over  seismic recording land channels each channel capable of electronically converting seismic data from analog to digital format and transmitting the digital data  geophones and cables  and other peripheral equipment 
our lease pool of marine seismic equipment includes more than kilometers of streamers recording channels that are towed behind a vessel  air compressors  air guns  streamer positioning equipment  energy source controllers and other equipment 
our lease pool of downhole equipment includes approximately levels of downhole seismic tools 
our lease pool equipment is manufactured by leading seismic equipment manufacturers and is widely used in the seismic industry 
our marine lease pool includes energy source controllers and rgps tracking systems that are manufactured by our seamap segment 
our equipment leases generally have terms of two to six months  one to two weeks in the case of downhole equipment  and are typically renewable following the initial rental period 
our equipment lease rates vary according 
table of contents to an item s expected useful life  utilization  initial cost and the term of the lease 
we provide maintenance of our leased equipment during the lease term for malfunctions due to failure of material and parts and will provide replacement equipment  as necessary 
in addition  we provide field technical support services when requested by our customers 
the customer is responsible for the cost of repairing equipment damages other than normal wear and tear and replacing destroyed or lost equipment under the terms of our standard lease agreements 
the customer is also normally responsible for the costs of shipping the equipment from and to one of our facilities and is responsible for all taxes  other than income taxes  related to the lease of the equipment 
the customer is required to obtain and maintain insurance for the replacement value of the equipment and a specified minimum amount of general liability insurance 
while it is our general practice to lease our seismic equipment on a monthly basis  in certain circumstances we lease equipment on a day rate usage basis 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
in canada and russia  a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from december through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain 
in other areas of the world  such as southeast asia and the pacific rim  periods of heavy rain  known as monsoons  can impair seismic operations 
we are able  in many cases  to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization 
for additional information about the impact of seasonality and weather  see item a risk factors 
upon completion of a lease  the equipment must generally be returned to one of our facilities for inspection  testing and  if necessary  repair 
while the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping and repairs  during this time the equipment is not available for lease to another customer 
therefore  managing this process and the utilization of the equipment is an important aspect of our operations 
given the short term of most of our leases  we believe that the highest achievable annual utilization for most of our equipment is approximately 
however  many factors can affect this utilization  including the term of our leases  the shipping time required to return equipment to one of our facilities  the time required to inspect  test and repair equipment after return from a lease and the demand for the equipment 
historically  the majority of the inspection  testing and repair have been done in our huntsville  texas or calgary  alberta facilities 
in recent years  however  we have added inspection and testing capabilities to our facilities in ufa  bashkortostan  russia and singapore 
with the establishment of our branch operations in colombia and peru  we added inspection  test and repair capabilities in those countries 
we believe that by expanding these capabilities we have been able to more effectively utilize our equipment and reduce costs associated with these operations  although it is not possible to quantify the effect of any such improvement 
the incremental cost for these additional facilities was not material 
lease pool equipment sales 
on occasion  we sell used equipment from our lease pool  normally in response to specific customer demand or to declining demand for rental of specific equipment 
used equipment sold from our lease pool can have a wide range of gross margins depending upon the amount of depreciation that has been recorded on the item 
when used equipment is sold from our lease pool  the net book value plus any cost associated with the sale is recorded to cost of goods sold 
sales of our lease pool equipment typically occur as opportunities arise and do not have a significant seasonal aspect 
sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately million  million and million in each of the three fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
we typically do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment 
however  we will evaluate any opportunities for the sale of equipment from our lease pool  and based upon our evaluation  may sell additional equipment 
such sales of lease pool equipment could be material 
other equipment sales 
the other equipment sales included in our equipment leasing segment fall into two broad categories sales of new seismic equipment 
on occasion  we will sell new seismic equipment in response to a specific demand from a customer 
these sales are made in cooperation with our suppliers of lease pool equipment 
sales of hydrographic and oceanographic equipment 
sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic

seamap designs  manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic  hydrographic and offshore industries 
seamap s primary products include i the gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which are designed to provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources  and ii the buoylink rgps tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers 
seamap s design operations are located in the united kingdom and in singapore and its manufacturing facilities are located in singapore 
key supplier agreements the sercel lease agreement in september  we entered into a new exclusive equipment lease agreement with sercel the exclusive equipment lease agreement  which replaced an agreement that expired in december under the new agreement  we are  with some exceptions  the exclusive worldwide authorized lessor for sercel s dsu xl three component digital sensors and the exclusive authorized lessor for sercel s downhole seismic tools in north and south america through december under the agreement  we agreed not to offer financing leases or leases with terms greater than one year related to the exclusive products as defined in the agreement without sercel s prior consent 
sercel agreed to refer any inquires for short term rentals of the exclusive products for use within the exclusive territory as defined in the agreement to us and to not recommend any competitor of ours as a source of such rentals 
sercel and we agreed to cooperate in the promotion and marketing of the exclusive products 
the agreement provides that sercel grant us specified pricing for the purchase of the exclusive products and certain other products 
in return  we agreed to purchase a total of  stations  or  channels  of dsu xl three component digital sensors and levels of downhole tools by december  as of january  we had purchased  stations of dsu xl and approximately levels of downhole tools pursuant to this agreement 
see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding our plans to meet these purchase obligations 
other agreements sap has a number of manufacturer s representation agreements for major product lines  including acoustic positioning systems  data acquisition systems  geophones  hydrophones  connectors  cables  test equipment  gps systems  heave compensators and attitude sensors  hydrographic data acquisition systems  magnetometers  tide gauges and current meters  radio positioning equipment  side scan sonar and sub bottom profiling systems  underwater communications and location devices  echo sounders and transducers 
certain software utilized by seamap s gunlink products was developed by tanglesolve instrumentation  ltd 
tanglesolve under a cooperation agreement with seamap 
under this agreement  tanglesolve received a royalty payment from the sale of each gunlink product 
in december  seamap acquired all of the capital stock of tanglesolve 
at the time  tanglesolve s only material assets were the cooperation agreement and the intellectual property related to the gunlink software 
in connection with this transaction  seamap entered into a new cooperation agreement with the former shareholders of tanglesolve whereby they provide certain on going support services 
in december  the cooperation agreement was extended through december by mutual consent  as provided for in the agreement 
customers  sales  backlog and marketing our lease customers generally are seismic data acquisition contractors 
we typically have a small number of lease customers  the composition of which changes yearly as leases are negotiated and concluded and equipment needs vary 
as of january   we had approximately lease customers with active leases of various lengths  but typically for less than a year 

table of contents we do not maintain a backlog of orders relating to our equipment leasing segment 
as of january   our seamap segment had a backlog of orders amounting to approximately million  compared to million as of january  we expect all of these orders to be fulfilled during our fiscal year ending january  we participate in both domestic and international trade shows and expositions to inform the industry of our products and services and we advertise in major geophysical trade journals 
a summary of our revenues from customers by geographic region is as follows in thousands years ended january  united states uk europe canada south america asia south pacific eurasia other total non united states total comprised of eastern europe  the russian federation and the cis includes africa and the middle east the net book value of our long lived assets in our various geographic locations is as follows in thousands as of january  location of property and equipment united states canada australia russia south america singapore united kingdom total non united states total for information regarding the risks associated with our foreign operations  see item a risk factors 
for fiscal  three customers the polarcus group of companies  cgv and global geophysical services represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
in fiscal and  one customer  cgv  accounted for approximately and  respectively of our consolidated revenues 
the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
no other customer accounted for or more of our revenues during these periods 
competition our major competitors are the major seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms and seismic contractors who might have excess equipment available for lease from time to time 
we face lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing  but competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors have not had as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool nor as wide 
table of contents geographic presence as we do 
we compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of i price and delivery  ii variety and availability of both peripheral seismic equipment and complete data acquisition systems and iii length of lease term 
we believe that our infrastructure and broad geographic presence also provide a major competitive advantage by contributing to our operational efficiencies 
we compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad range of seismic equipment owners  including seismic data acquisition contractors  who use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment  many of whom have substantially greater financial resources than our own 
suppliers we have several suppliers of seismic equipment for our lease pool 
we acquire the majority of our seismic lease pool equipment from  sercel 
however  we also acquire lease pool equipment from a number of other suppliers including ion  bauer compressors  inc and oyo geospace corporation 
management believes that our current relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 
for the years ended january   and  approximately  and  respectively of our revenues were generated from the rental of products we acquired from sercel 
for additional information regarding the risk associated with our suppliers  see item a risk factors 
employees as of january   we employed people full time  none of whom are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement

environmental regulation we are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment and the manner in which chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes are handled and wastes generated from such operations are disposed 
we have established proactive environmental policies for the management of these chemicals and materials as well as the handling and recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits for regulated activities  capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges  and special precautions for disposal of certain wastes 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctive relief 
spills or releases of chemicals  materials and wastes at our facilities or at offsite locations where they are transported for recycling or disposal could subject us to environmental liability  which may be strict  joint and several  for the costs of cleaning up chemicals  materials and wastes released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by such spills or releases 
as a result of such actions  we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes  remediate environmental contamination  and undertake measures to prevent future contamination 
the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial 
table of contents position 
for instance  the adoption of laws or implementing regulations with regard to climate change that have the effect of lowering the demand for carbon based fuels or with regard to hydraulic fracturing that have the effect of decreasing the performance of exploratory activities by energy companies could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us  we cannot give any assurance that this trend will continue in the future

the risk factors described below are not the only risks we face 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional factors that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us  such as general economic conditions 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements included under cautionary statements abut forward looking statements of this form k 
all forward looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below 
if the current  weak economic conditions continue for an extended period of time or commodity prices become depressed or decline  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
historically  the demand for our products and services has been sensitive to the level of exploration spending by oil and gas companies 
commencing in late  prices for oil and natural gas declined significantly and did not recover until relatively recently 
during the period of depressed commodity prices  many oil and gas exploration and production companies significantly reduced their levels of capital spending  including amounts dedicated to the leasing or purchasing our seismic equipment 
a return of depressed commodity prices  or a decline in existing commodity prices  could adversely affect demand for the services and equipment we provide  and therefore adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
further  perceptions of a long term decrease in commodity prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
additionally  these factors may adversely impact our statement of financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets or of our other long lived assets 

table of contents demand for seismic data is not assured 
demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  production and development activities  as well as on the number of crews conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition worldwide 
the levels of such spending are influenced by oil and gas prices and industry expectations of future price levels  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the availability of current geophysical data  the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration operations  the granting of leases or exploration concessions and the expiration of such rights  domestic and foreign tax policies  merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  and local and international political and economic conditions 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry can have a significant effect on our revenues and profitability 
historically  oil and natural gas prices  as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity  have fluctuated significantly 
these fluctuations have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress development activity  adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in a given financial period 
projects awarded to and scheduled by our customers can be delayed or cancelled due to factors that are outside of their control  which can affect the demand for our products and services 
these factors include budgetary or other financial issues of the oil and gas exploration companies  adverse weather conditions  difficulties in obtaining permits or other regulatory issues  the availability of other equipment required for a particular project  political unrest or security concerns in certain foreign locations  as well as a variety of other factors 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of one of these customers could harm our results of operations 
we typically lease and sell significant amounts of seismic equipment to a relatively small number of customers  the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers equipment needs vary 
therefore  at any one time  a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers 
in the fiscal years ended january   and  our single largest customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in the fiscal year ended january  there has recently been considerable consolidation among certain of our customers and this trend may continue 
this consolidation could result in the loss of our customers and could result in a decrease in the demand for our equipment 
the financial soundness of our customers could materially affect our business and operating results 
as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges that continue to affect the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  our customers may experience cash flow concerns 
as a result  if customers operating and financial performance deteriorates  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts 
table of contents receivable owed to us 
any inability of current and or potential customers to pay us for services may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as of january   we had approximately million of customer accounts and contracts receivable  of which approximately million was over days past due 
for the years ended january  and  we had charges of million and million  respectively  to our provision for doubtful accounts 
significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we derive significant revenues from foreign sales  which pose additional risks to our operations 
many of our foreign operations are conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
those currencies include the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the singapore dollar  the russian ruble and the british pound sterling 
these internationally sourced revenues are subject to the risk of taxation policies  expropriation  political turmoil  civil disturbances  armed hostilities  and other geopolitical hazards as well as foreign currency exchange controls in which payment could not be made in us dollars and fluctuations 
for example  for accounting purposes  balance sheet accounts of our operating subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period 
statement of operations items are translated at average currency exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
this translation adjustment has in the past been  and may in the future be  material because of the significant amount of assets held by our international subsidiaries and the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates 
we may not be able to obtain funding or obtain funding on acceptable terms because of the deterioration of the credit and capital markets  which may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile 
the debt and equity capital markets have been exceedingly distressed 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions have made  and will likely continue to make  it difficult to obtain funding in the capital markets 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to our current debt and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide any new funding 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to grow our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected if we are unable to continually obtain additional lease contracts 
our seismic equipment leases typically have a term of two to six months and provide gross revenues that recover only a portion of our capital investment on the initial lease 
our ability to generate lease revenues and profits is dependent on obtaining additional lease contracts after the termination of an original lease 
however  lease customers are under no obligation to  and frequently do not  continue to lease seismic equipment after the expiration of a lease 
although we have been successful in obtaining additional lease contracts with other customers after the termination of the original leases  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so 
our failure to obtain additional leases or extensions beyond the initial lease term would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

table of contents our failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our operations 
our success is dependent on  among other things  the services of certain key personnel  including specifically billy f 
mitcham  jr  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
mitcham or other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our long lived assets may be subject to impairment due to the current financial crisis 
we periodically review our long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets and our lease pool of equipment  for impairment 
if we expect significant sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices in the future  we may be required to write down the value of these assets if the future cash flows anticipated to be generated from the related the assets falls below net book value 
declines in oil and natural gas prices  if sustained  could result in future impairments 
if we are forced to write down the value of our long lived assets  these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded 
see the discussion included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies long lived assets 
our seismic lease pool is subject to technological obsolescence 
we have a substantial capital investment in seismic data acquisition equipment 
the development by manufacturers of seismic equipment of newer technology systems or component parts that have significant competitive advantages over seismic systems and component parts now in use could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and sell our existing seismic equipment 
significant improvements in technology may also require us to recognize an asset impairment charge to our lease pool investment and to correspondingly invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our existing lease pool with newer technology equipment demanded by our customers  which could affect our ability to compete as well as have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
seasonal conditions cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year have historically accounted for a greater portion of our lease revenues than do our second and third quarters 
this seasonality in leasing revenues is primarily due to the increased seismic survey activity in canada and russia from january through march or april 
this seasonal pattern may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
we face competition in our seismic equipment leasing activities 
we have several competitors engaged in seismic equipment leasing and sales  including seismic equipment manufacturers and data acquisition contractors that use seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than our own 
there are also several smaller competitors that  in the aggregate  generate significant revenues from the sale of seismic survey equipment 
pressures from existing or new competitors could adversely affect our business operations 
we rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations 
we purchase the majority of our seismic equipment for our lease pool from a small number of suppliers 
should our relationships with our suppliers deteriorate  we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology required by our customers and maintaining our existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers specifications 
in addition  we may  from time to time  experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers  and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet our lease commitments 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involve several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules  any of these events could adversely affect our future results of operations 

table of contents equipment in our lease pool may be subject to the intellectual property claims of others that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the lease of the equipment 
certain of the equipment in our lease pool is proprietary to us 
the equipment we acquired with the acquisition of aes see item business includes heli pickers and associated equipment that is manufactured by aes and is subject to various patents see item business intellectual property 
we also have some equipment in our lease pool that is manufactured by our seamap segment  which is subject to intellectual property rights and protection as discussed below 
we may be subject to infringement claims and other intellectual property disputes as competition in the marketplace continues to intensify 
in the future  we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention from operations 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could  among other things result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  and prevent us from leasing or selling our products that incorporate the technology 
additionally  the equipment that we acquire from other suppliers may be subject to the intellectual property infringement claims from third parties 
we generally are indemnified by our suppliers against any claims that may be brought against us by third parties related to equipment they sold to us 
however  such claims could affect our ability to acquire additional such products or to lease them in the future 
the loss of this future revenue could adversely affect our business and would not generally be covered by the indemnities from our suppliers 
the operations of seamap are subject to special risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the design and manufacturing operations of our seamap segment are subject to risks not associated with our equipment leasing business 
these risks include the following risks associated with intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our design information  documentation and other proprietary information 
these intellectual property protection measures may not be sufficient to prevent wrongful misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  these measures will not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the laws of many foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to protect proprietary information could result in  among other things  loss of competitive advantage  loss of customer orders and decreased revenues 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be impaired 
we may be subject to infringement claims and other intellectual property disputes as competition in the marketplace continues to intensify 
in the future  we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention from operations 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could  among other things result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  require us to redesign the products that use the technology  and 
table of contents prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products that incorporate the technology 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
any litigation to protect our intellectual property or to defend ourselves against the claims of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful 
risks related to product performance 
the production of new products with high technology content involves occasional problems while the technology and manufacturing methods mature 
if significant reliability or quality problems develop  including those due to faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with reworking the manufacturing processes  high service and warranty expenses  high inventory obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there may be interruptions or delays in the activation of products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that cannot be promptly resolved  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
risks related to raw materials 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to design and test our products 
certain components used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of vendors 
if these suppliers were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us  or if these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems that prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components  these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance issues  materials shortages  excess demand  reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us  thereby adversely affecting our business and customer relationships 
some of the sole source and limited source vendors are companies who  from time to time  may allocate parts to equipment manufacturers due to market demand for components and equipment 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements 
many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared vendors  thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components 
if our supply arrangements are interrupted  we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from alternative sources  reduced supplies and higher prices of components will significantly limit our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to customers 
a delay in receiving certain components or the inability to receive certain components could harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
failures of components affect the reliability and performance of our products  can reduce customer confidence in our products  and may adversely affect our financial performance 
from time to time  we may experience delays in receipt of components and may receive components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could harm our business 
in addition  a consolidation among suppliers of these components 
table of contents or adverse developments in their businesses that affect their ability to meet our supply demands could adversely impact the availability of components that we depend on 
delayed deliveries from these sources could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could increase our costs of compliance and impose significant liabilities 
we are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and the handling of chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the recycling and disposal of wastes generated by those processes 
these laws and regulations may impose joint and several strict liability and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of remedial obligations  and issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations 
these laws and regulations could require us to acquire permits to conduct regulated activities install and maintain costly equipment and pollution control technologies  or to incur other significant environmental related expenses 
public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
we anticipate that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental laws and regulations will continue  the occurrence of which may require us to increase our capital expenditures or could result in increased operating expenses 
climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas  thereby adversely affecting our business  while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our manufacturing of seismic equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
on december   the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings allow the epa to adoption and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
accordingly  the epa had proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and could trigger permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources 
in addition  on october   the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in only very recently  on march   the epa announced a proposed rulemaking that would expand its final rule on reporting of greenhouse gas emissions to include owners and operators of onshore oil and natural gas production 
if the proposed rule is finalized in its current form  monitoring of those newly covered sources would commence on january  also  on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  or acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane that may contribute to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
under this legislation  the epa would issue a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
these allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time 
the net effect of acesa will be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products and natural gas 
the us senate has begun work on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions and president obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system 
the adoption and implementation of any laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  oil and gas exploration and production activities could have an adverse effect on the demand for our seismic equipment and associated services 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could adversely affect or delay our manufacturing of seismic equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 

table of contents federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business 
the federal congress is currently considering two companions bills in the united states  known as the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act  or frac act  that would repeal an exemption in the federal safe drinking water act for the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids near drinking water sources 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process for the completion of natural gas  and to a lesser extent  oil wells in formations with low permeabilities  such as shale formations 
if enacted  the frac act could result in additional regulatory burdens such as permitting  construction  financial assurance  monitoring  recordkeeping  and plugging and abandonment requirements 
the frac act also proposes requiring the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities  who would then make such information publicly available 
the availability of this information could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  various state and local governments are considering increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements  operational restrictions  and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain environmentally sensitive areas such as watersheds 
the adoption of the frac act or any other federal or state laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or otherwise limiting  the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in certain formations and adversely affect the demand for our seismic equipment and associated services 
moreover  the epa announced only recently  on march   that it has allocated million in and has requested funding in fiscal year for conducting a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
consequently  even if these bills are not adopted  the performance of the hydraulic fracturing study by the epa could spur further action at a later date towards federal legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities 
our stock price is subject to volatility 
energy and energy service company stock prices  including our stock price  have been extremely volatile from time to time 
stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by  among other things  impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing 
we have significant operations outside of the united states that expose us to certain additional risks 
we operate in a number of foreign locations and have subsidiaries or branches in foreign countries  including russia  peru and colombia 
our equipment is also often temporarily located in other foreign locations while under rent by our customers 
these operations expose us to political and economic risks and uncertainties 
should current circumstances change  we could encounter difficulties in operating in some countries and may not be able to retrieve our equipment that is located within these counties 
this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions and results of operations 
because we have no plans to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth 
any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available  our financial condition  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
accordingly  investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

table of contents provisions in our articles of incorporation and texas law could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares for a premium 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and the texas business corporation act may tend to delay  defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest  including an attempt that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares 
because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with preferences and rights as it determines  it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences  rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in two segments  equipment leasing and seamap 
our equipment leasing operations are conducted from our huntsville  texas headquarters and from our locations in calgary  canada  brisbane  australia  lima  peru  bogota  colombia  and ufa  russia 
this includes the operations of our mcl  sap and mse subsidiaries and our branches in peru and colombia 
these branches were established late in fiscal and did not contribute material revenues in the year ended january  seamap operates from its locations near bristol  united kingdom and in singapore 
management believes that the performance of our equipment leasing segment is indicated by revenues from equipment leasing and by the level of our investment in lease pool equipment 
management further believes that the performance of our seamap segment is indicated by revenues from equipment sales and by gross profit from those sales 
management monitors ebitda and adjusted ebitda  both as defined in the following table  as key indicators of our overall performance 

table of contents the following table presents certain operating information by operating segment years ended january  in thousands revenues equipment leasing seamap less inter segment sales total revenues cost of sales equipment leasing seamap less inter segment costs total direct costs gross profit equipment leasing seamap less inter segment amounts total gross profit operating expenses general and administrative provision for doubtful accounts gain on insurance settlement depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income ebitda adjusted ebitda reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda net income interest expense income  net depreciation  amortization and impairment provision for income taxes ebitda stock based compensation adjusted ebitda ebitda is defined as net income before a interest income and interest expense  b provision for or benefit from income taxes and c depreciation  amortization and impairment 
adjusted ebitda excludes stock based compensation 
we consider ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be important indicators for the performance of our business  but not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we have included these non gaap financial measures because management utilizes this information for assessing our performance and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures  service debt and finance working capital requirements 

table of contents the covenants of our revolving credit agreement require us to maintain a minimum level of ebitda 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are measurements that are commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance of companies such as us 
in particular  we believe that it is useful to our analysts and investors to understand this relationship because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities 
we believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
in evaluating our performance as measured by ebitda  management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measurement 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes  interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures 
accordingly  editda and adjusted ebitda are only two of the measurements that management utilizes 
other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda or adjusted ebitda differently than we do and ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
in our equipment leasing segment  we lease seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements 
the majority of all active leases at january  were for a term of less than one year 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
we acquire some marine lease pool equipment from our seamap segment 
these amounts are carried in our lease pool at the cost to our seamap segment  less accumulated depreciation 
from time to time  we sell lease pool equipment to our customers 
these sales are usually transacted when we have equipment for which we do not have near term needs in our leasing business 
we also occasionally sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers 
in addition to leasing seismic equipment  sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
our seamap segment designs  manufactures and sells a variety of products used primarily in marine seismic applications 
seamap s primary products include the i gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide marine operators more precise control of exploration tools  and ii the buoylink rgps tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers marine recording channels that are towed behind a vessel 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
in canada and russia  a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity normally occurs in the winter months  from december through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain 
in other areas of the world  such as southeast asia and the pacific rim  periods of heavy rain  known as monsoons  can impair seismic operations 
we are able  in many cases  to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization 
business outlook prior to the turmoil in global financial markets  which arose during  the oil and gas exploration industry enjoyed generally sustained growth for a period of more than four years  fueled primarily by historically high commodity prices for oil and natural gas 
we  along with much of the seismic industry  benefited from this growth 
these higher prices resulted in increased activity within the oil and gas industry and  in turn  resulted in an increased demand for seismic services 
beginning in approximately october  there was a dramatic decline in oil and gas prices which resulted in a significant reduction in oil and gas exploration activity 
accordingly  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to see a decline in demand for our products and services 
this decline was the most dramatic in north america  russia and the cis 
in north america  we believe the decline resulted from the decrease in oil and natural gas prices and from difficulties in the credit markets which limited the amount of capital available to independent oil and gas exploration companies 
in russia and the cis  we think the decline in global oil prices and the devaluation of the ruble had a dramatic negative effect on the economics of oil and gas exploration 
table of contents and production operations 
furthermore  the global financial crisis had a material adverse effect on the liquidity available to these companies in russia and the cis 
during this period  there were some areas where oil and gas exploration activities continued 
we believe that this continued activity was largely driven by the super major oil and gas companies and by national oil companies 
our revenues are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which  in turn  are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
land seismic data acquisition activity levels are measured in terms of the number of active recording crews  known as the crew count  and the number of recording channels deployed by those crews  known as channel count 
because an accurate and reliable census of active crews does not exist  it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding the absolute levels of seismic data acquisition activity 
furthermore  a significant number of seismic data acquisition contractors are either private or state owned enterprises and information about their activities is not available in the public domain 
in recent months there has been a recovery in global crude oil prices and  to a much lesser extent  north american natural gas prices 
as a result of this  there are indications of an increase in oil and gas exploration activity in some areas  such as russia  the cis  southeast asia and south america 
however  activity in north america has not recovered to the same degree 
accordingly  the current outlook for our business is uncertain 
however  the geographic breadth of our operations and our expansive lease pool of equipment  as well as our generally stable financial position and our million credit line position us  we believe  to address any downturn in the seismic industry for the foreseeable future 
the market for products sold by seamap and the demand for the leasing of marine seismic equipment is dependent upon activity within the offshore  or marine  seismic industry  including the re fitting of existing seismic vessels and the equipping of new vessels 
the ability of our customers to build or re fit vessels is dependant in part on their ability to obtain appropriate financing 
our seamap business in fiscal benefited from orders we received in late fiscal for our gunlink and buoylink products 
although there was a decline in marine seismic activity during fiscal  there have been recent indications of a rebound in such activity 
in addition  certain existing and potential customers have continued to express interest in our gunlink and buoylink products 
some of this interest involves the upgrade of exiting gunlink and buoylink products to newer versions or systems with greater functionality 
during fiscal and  we responded to the increased demand for our services and products by adding new equipment to our lease pool and by introducing new products from our seamap segment 
during fiscal and  we added approximately million and million  respectively  of equipment to our lease pool 
during fiscal  we added approximately million of new lease pool equipment  despite the decline in demand for equipment during this period 
although we did experience an overall decline in demand  there was an increase in demand for certain types of equipment  such as downhole seismic tools and three component digital sensors 
we responded to this demand by acquiring more of this equipment  as well as other equipment for which we had specific demand or anticipated demand in the near future 
we may acquire additional downhole  three component digital sensors and other equipment in fiscal  however  we do not expect our expenditures for lease pool equipment to reach the same level as in fiscal in the past few years we have expanded our lease pool by acquiring different types of equipment or equipment that can be used in different types of seismic applications 
for example  we added marine seismic equipment to our lease pool and have purchased downhole seismic equipment that can be utilized in a wide array of applications  some of which are not related to oil and gas exploration 
these applications include d surface seismic surveys  well and reservoir monitoring  analysis of fluid treatments of oil and gas wells and underground storage monitoring 
in the future we may seek to further expand the breadth of our lease pool  which could increase the amount we expend on the acquisition of lease pool equipment 
we also have expanded the geographic breadth of our operations by acquiring or establishing operating facilities in new locations 
most recently  in fiscal  we established branch operations in peru and in colombia 

table of contents we may seek to expand our operations in to additional locations in the future either through establishing green field operations or by acquiring existing operations 
however  we do not currently have any specific plans to establish any such operations 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated from foreign sources 
for the years ended january   and  revenues from international customers totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts represent  and of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years  respectively 
the decrease in the proportion of our revenues from foreign sources in fiscal was the result of a specific contract in the united states during that period and is not  we believe  indicative of a trend 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states  australian  canadian and singapore dollars  russian rubles and british pounds sterling 
we have not entered  nor do we intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
our revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three fiscal years  except as described above 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded operating income of approximately  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  and approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  the significant decline in fiscal was primarily the result of reduced equipment leasing revenues  reduced equipment sales within our leasing segment and higher lease pool depreciation charges 
these declines were offset by improved sales and gross profits from our seamap segment and by lower general and administrative expense 
the decline in operating income in fiscal was due primarily to significantly higher depreciation charges and  to a lesser extent  lower sales of new and used seismic equipment 
our equipment leasing segment recorded decreased gross profit in the year ended january  of approximately million  as compared to approximately million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
decreased leasing and equipment sales revenues  combined with higher direct costs and lease pool depreciation contributed to this decline 
despite an increase in rental revenues  gross profit in fiscal declined due to the higher depreciation charges that resulted from the significant amounts of lease pool equipment we added in fiscal and our seamap segment recorded gross profits of million  million and million in the years ended january   and  respectively 
seamap revenues increased in fiscal despite the overall downturn in the seismic industry due in part to production of orders received in fiscal for gunlink and buoylink products and on going support activities from our installed base of these products 
we were able to improve gross profit margins in this period through production and procurement efficiencies associated with the large orders received in fiscal although sales of seamap products declined from fiscal to fiscal  gross profit remained essentially the same 
the improvement in gross profit margins in this period resulted from production efficiencies and the elimination of certain royalty payments as more fully described below 

table of contents revenues and cost of sales equipment leasing revenues and cost of sales from our equipment leasing segment is comprised of the following year ended january  in thousands revenues equipment leasing lease pool equipment sales new seismic equipment sales sap equipment sales cost of sales lease pool depreciation direct costs equipment leasing cost of lease pool equipment sales cost of new seismic equipment sales cost of sap equipment sales gross profit gross profit margin beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to experience a decline in demand for our leasing services 
the demand for equipment in canada and russia that normally occurs with the onset of winter was lower than in prior years and was significantly less than had been anticipated earlier in the year 
this decline was due to significant reductions in oil and gas exploration activity as discussed above 
the reduced activity in north america and the cis  as well as other parts of the world  continued throughout fiscal resulting in a decline in equipment leasing revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  there were areas of improving demand such as south america and the pacific rim and late in demand began to increase in russia and for marine equipment 
these improvements did not  however  offset the overall decline in demand 
during fiscal  we generated approximately million in equipment leasing revenues from one project in the united states 
this was an unusually large contract and there can be no assurance that we will obtain similar contracts in the future 
in fiscal  our equipment leasing revenues increased approximately million  or  over fiscal this increase was due to continued strong demand for seismic equipment through the first part of fiscal and expansion of our lease pool 
in fiscal  we acquired approximately million of new lease pool equipment due to expected demand from customers 
likewise  in fiscal  we added approximately million of new lease pool equipment 
in fiscal  we added approximately million of new equipment to our lease pool  despite the decline in demand for rental equipment 
we added this equipment in response to demand for specific types of equipment  including downhole seismic tools and three component digital sensors 
we believe that the demand for this equipment  as well as for the balance of our lease pool of equipment  will increase as world wide oil and gas exploration activity recovers 
there can be  however  no assurance as to the timing or extent of the recovery  if any 
from time to time  we sell equipment from our lease pool based on specific customer demand or in order to redeploy our capital in other lease pool assets 
these transactions tend to occur as opportunities arise and accordingly are difficult to predict 
the gross profit and related gross profit margin from the sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately  in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal often  the equipment that is sold from our lease pool has been held by us  and 
table of contents therefore depreciated  for some period of time 
accordingly  the equipment sold may have a relatively low net book value at the time of the sale  resulting in a relatively high gross profit from the transaction 
the amount of the gross profit on a particular transaction varies greatly based primarily upon the age of the equipment 
occasionally  we sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers 
often  these arrangements are structured with a significant down payment  with the balance financed over a period of time at a market rate of interest 
the gross profit and related gross profit margin from the sales of new seismic equipment amounted to approximately  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal with the down turn in oil and gas exploration activity  we have seen a significant decline in demand for the purchase of new and used land seismic equipment 
we expect this trend to continue 
sap regularly sells new hydrographic and oceanographic equipment to customers in australia and throughout the pacific rim 
the gross profit and related gross profit margin from the sale of new seismic  hydrographic and oceanographic equipment by sap amounted to approximately  in fiscal  million  in fiscal  and million in fiscal included in sap equipment sales for the year ended january  and is approximately million and million  respectively  related to an approximately million contract with the australian government 
this contract is accounted for using the percentage of completion method and resulted in a gross loss of approximately  in fiscal and a gross profit of approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we incurred approximately  in unexpected costs related to the fulfillment of this contract and have submitted claims to the government for reimbursement of these expenses 
however  until the claims are approved we have not recognized any benefit from the claims in the calculation of profit from the project 
there is approximately  of additional revenues  and gross profit of approximately  to be recognized upon completion of the contract  which has been pending since the second quarter of fiscal all activities under the contract have been completed except for the acceptance by the government of final contract documentation 
the sale of hydrographic and oceanographic equipment in fiscal declined  we believe  due to the budgetary concerns of various governmental agencies in light of the global financial crisis 
these concerns caused projects and purchases to be cancelled or postponed 
we believe that many of these purchases have merely been delayed and will occur in the future  however  there can be no assurance of this 
depreciation expense related to lease pool equipment for fiscal amounted to approximately million  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the increase in depreciation expense in each of the periods resulted from the additions to our lease pool of equipment that we have made in recent periods 
at january   lease pool assets with an acquisition cost of approximately million were fully depreciated  yet remained in service 
this compares to million at january  and approximately million at january  these assets  though fully depreciated  are expected to continue to generate revenues through leasing activity 
our business generally parallels trends in the oil and gas industry 
increased demand for our equipment results in higher revenues and generally has no impact on depreciation in the short term as our equipment is depreciated from the first month it is placed in service until it is fully depreciated 
depreciation expense is recorded monthly whether or not the equipment is actually generating revenues on a lease contract 
during periods of high demand  such as we experienced prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  our ability to lease older equipment  including fully depreciated equipment is enhanced  whereas in periods of low demand such as we experienced in fiscal  the opposite is true 
as a result  revenues and depreciation expense will not necessarily directly correlate 
over the long term  depreciation expense is impacted by increases in equipment purchases to meet demand for our leased equipment 
we have been able to purchase equipment at discounts through volume purchase arrangements 
a lower purchase price results in lower depreciation expense than in previous periods 
although some of the equipment in our lease pool has reached the end of its depreciable life the equipment continues to be in service and continues to generate revenues 
because the depreciable life of our equipment in our industry is determined more by technical obsolescence than by usage or wear and tear  some of our equipment  although fully depreciated  is still capable of functioning appropriately 
we recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal in the amount of approximately million as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues  as the three main components of direct costs are freight  repairs and 
table of contents sublease expense 
in fiscal  costs increased despite the decline in leasing revenues due to the cost of importing equipment into russia  peru and colombia and due to costs associated with sub leasing certain equipment 
costs in fiscal decreased in spite of higher leasing revenues  primarily due to greater reimbursement of costs from our customers and lower costs to lease certain equipment from others 
seamap revenues and cost of sales for our seamap segment are as follows year ended january  in thousands equipment sales cost of equipment sales gross profit gross profit margin demand for seamap s products is generally dependent upon offshore oil and gas exploration activity 
a large portion of seamap s sales consist of large discrete orders the timing of which is dictated by our customers 
this timing generally relates to the availability of a vessel in port so that our equipment can be installed 
accordingly  there can be significant variation in sales from one period to another that does not necessarily indicate a fundamental change in demand for these products 
despite the overall decline in oil and gas exploration activity discussed above  we did not experience a decline in the demand for seamap s products in fiscal as of january   seamap had a backlog of approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of january  and million as of january  the backlog as of january  consisted primarily of orders from the polarcus group of companies polarcus to provide gunlink and buoylink systems for six new build vessels 
in the second quarter of fiscal  polarcus cancelled the orders related to two of the vessels 
the balance of the orders was completed and delivered during fiscal in addition to the revenues related to the polarcus orders  we generated revenues from the sale of various other equipment and from on going support and repair activities related to our installed base of gunlink and buoylink products 
revenues in fiscal were unusually large due to the sale of approximately of ancillary equipment in connection with gunlink sales that we normally do not provide to customers 
our gross profit margin from the sale of seamap equipment has increased in each of the last three fiscal years due to a number of factors 
beginning in fiscal and concluding in fiscal  we moved all production activities from the united kingdom to singapore 
labor and material costs are generally lower in singapore  thereby improving our gross profit margins 
as the gunlink and buoylink product lines have matured  we have been able to introduce design and production efficiencies that allow us to reduce cost through the use of less expensive components and materials 
when we receive larger orders  such as those from polarcus  we are able to take advantage of volume purchases and better plan production activities which contribute to improved gross margins 
effective december  we eliminated certain royalty costs that we had been required to pay upon the sale of the gunlink products 
prior to december  in connection with the sale of each gunlink system  we were required to pay a royalty to a party who had developed certain software utilized by those products 
in december  we purchased the intellectual property related to that software and  accordingly  are no longer required to pay the royalty 
had we owned this intellectual property during fiscal we estimate that our gross profit for those periods would have been improved by approximately million 
operating expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal amounted to approximately million  compared to approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses declined due to lower stock based compensation  incentive compensation  travel and legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses were essentially flat between fiscal and despite lower 
table of contents incentive compensation costs in fiscal this decline was offset by higher travel costs and higher legal and accounting costs 
in fiscal  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal under asc  the fair value of stock based awards  such as stock options and restricted stock  is estimated at the time of the grant 
this estimated value is then amortized over the expected vesting period of the award as compensation expense 
during fiscal  and  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in the amount of approximately million  million  and  respectively 
given the recent economic downturn and global financial crisis  we believe that certain of our customers may have difficulty accessing the liquidity necessary to meet their obligations to us 
accordingly  we have made a provision for those accounts that management believes may not be collectable 
included in the provision for doubtful accounts is approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal related to a contract receivable 
the customer has defaulted on this obligation and we are in the process of foreclosing on the equipment and other assets that were pledged as collateral 
we have reduced the carrying value of this contract receivable to an amount equal to the fair market value of the equipment  based on an independent appraisal  less the estimated costs to retrieve the equipment 
we intend to add this equipment to our lease pool 
at january  and  we had trade accounts and note receivables over days past due of approximately million and million  respectively 
in our industry  and in our experience  it is not unusual for accounts to become delinquent from time to time and this is not necessarily indicative of an account becoming uncollectable 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
in september  certain of our lease pool equipment was destroyed by hurricane ike while it was at a third party repair facility 
in december  we received a payment of approximately million from our insurance carrier in settlement of the damage claim arising from this destruction 
the amount received exceeded the net book value of the equipment destroyed  resulting in a gain of  depreciation and amortization  other than lease pool depreciation  relates primarily to the depreciation of furniture  fixtures and office equipment and the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of seamap 
other income and expense interest income reflects amounts earned on invested funds and finance charges related to seismic equipment sold under financing arrangements 
interest expense primarily reflects interest costs arising from borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
interest expense increased in fiscal due to borrowings under our line revolving line of credit used to finance purchases of lease pool equipment in late fiscal and during fiscal other income for the year ended january  and includes approximately  and  respectively  related to net foreign exchange gains 
these gains resulted primarily from transactions of our foreign subsidiaries denominated in us dollars 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes in fiscal amounted to approximately  this amount included a current tax benefit of  a deferred tax benefit of  a provision of  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax benefits and the reduction of estimated penalties and interest of  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax positions 
the current tax provision is made up of a benefit of approximately million in united states taxes and approximately million payable to foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom  singapore and russia 
in accordance with the provisions asc  we have estimated the amount of penalties and interest that might accrue during the period should certain uncertain tax positions be resolved not in our favor 
this amount is recorded as income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our canadian tax returns have been audited by the canadian revenue agency cra 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these audits  the cra and provincial taxing authorities have assessed additional taxes  penalties and interest of approximately million 
the matters giving rise to these assessments relate  we believe  primarily to issues as to whether deductions are properly taken in 
table of contents canada  or should be taken in the united states 
therefore  we have made application to the cra and to the internal revenue service irs for competent authority assistance in order to avoid potential double taxation as provided for under the tax treaty between the united states and canada 
accordingly  we expect these issues to be resolved pursuant to the competent authority process between the cra and irs 
we have  however  filed protective protests with the cra and with the province of alberta in case our request for competent authority assistance is denied 
the issues involved in these assessments are included in our analysis of uncertain tax positions 
in connection with the protests  we were required to make a payment totaling approximately million against these potential obligations 
should we prevail in our request for assistance or in our appeals  all  or a portion  of this payment will be refunded 
we are unable to estimate how long it will take to resolve these matters 
our provision for income taxes in fiscal amounted to approximately million 
this amount included current taxes of million  deferred taxes of million  a benefit of million related to the recognition of certain tax benefits and estimated penalties and interest of  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax positions 
the current tax provision is made up of approximately  in united states taxes and approximately million payable to foreign jurisdictions  primarily australia  singapore and russia 
income taxes currently payable in the united states were reduced by approximately  due to deductions arising from the exercise of non qualified stock options 
this amount did not reduce our current tax provision but is credited directly to paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of asc the million tax benefit was recognized upon the resolution of specific uncertain tax positions 
this uncertainty was resolved upon the expiration of the period in which certain of our us tax returns could be examined by the irs 
in accordance with the provisions asc we have estimated the amount of penalties and interest that might accrue during the period should certain uncertain tax positions be resolved not in our favor 
this amount is recorded as income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements

see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity and capital over the past three fiscal years has been cash flows provided by operating activities 
the principal factor that has affected our cash flows is in the level of oil and gas exploration and development activities as discussed above 
as of january   we had working capital of approximately million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  including restricted cash of approximately  as compared to working capital of approximately million and cash and temporary investments of approximately million at january  our working capital increased from january  to january  primarily due to working capital generated by operations and from the use of proceeds from our revolving credit facility to reduce accounts payable 
the accounts payable arose primarily from the purchase of lease pool equipment 
cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities were net income of  and non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization totaling approximately million  provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million and stock based compensation of approximately million 
the net change in other current assets and liabilities decreased net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal by approximately million 
the most significant items contributing to this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents were an increase in trade accounts and contracts receivable of approximately million  the payment of approximately million related to the pending tax audit in canada and a decrease in costs and contract billings in excess of revenue of approximately million 
the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related primarily to the effect of lease pool equipment purchases 
in fiscal  and  we acquired approximately million  million and million  respectively  of new lease pool equipment  however  the cash expenditures for these purchases did not all occur within those respective periods 
as of january   our accounts payable included approximately million related to lease pool purchases 
as of january   the amount in accounts payable related to lease pool purchases was approximately million  while the comparable amount as of january  was approximately million 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended january   and indicated purchases of equipment held for lease of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  the equipment added to our lease pool included additional stations of three component digital sensors  submersible recording channels  additional conventional recording channels and downhole seismic tools 
due to the recent decline in leasing activity  we expect lease pool additions in fiscal to be less than in fiscal cash flows from investing activities for each of the three fiscal years   and reflect proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the sale of used lease pool equipment 
we generally do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment  however  from time to time we will do so in response to particular customer demand 
in determining whether or not to sell lease pool equipment  we weigh expected future leasing revenues from that equipment versus the potential proceeds that may be received upon the sale of the equipment 
in fiscal  we received an insurance settlement of approximately million arising from the destruction of equipment during hurricane ike 
in fiscal  we paid the former shareholders of seamap million in settlement of the final earn out payment due in connection with the acquisition of seamap in fiscal also  in fiscal  we paid approximately million to purchase an entity that owned the intellectual property related to software utilized on one of seamap s primary products  gunlink 
in addition to the intellectual property  this entity held an account receivable from seamap in the amount of approximately million arising from royalties from the use of that intellectual property 
accordingly  our expenditure related to the acquisition of seamap and related activities amounted to approximately million in fiscal included within financing activities are net borrowings under our revolving line of credit of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the proceeds from these borrowings are used primarily to temporarily finance purchases of new lease pool equipment 
financing activities in fiscal and also include the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
these transactions resulted in cash infusions of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  sap purchased approximately million in short term investments  consisting of time deposits with an australian bank 
these deposits were then pledged as collateral for performance bonds issued in connection with sap s contract with the australian government 
approximately  of these investments were redeemed in fiscal as the collateral was released 
these obligations are expected to be fulfilled and the remaining collateral released during fiscal due to the financing nature of this transaction  the purchase of the temporary investments is reflected within cash flows from financing activities 
in connection with the temporary importation of our lease pool equipment into some countries we are required to post import bonds with the customs authorities of that country 
these bonds are normally provided by local insurance or surety companies 
in some cases the surety requires that we post collateral to secure our obligations under the bonds 
as of april   we have provided stand by letters of credit totaling approximately million as security for customs bonds 
in september  we entered into a new million revolving credit agreement with first victoria national bank the bank  which replaced our existing million facility with the bank 
amounts available for borrowing are determined by a borrowing base 
the borrowing base is computed based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible lease pool assets 
based upon the latest calculation of the borrowing base we believe that the entire million of the facility is available to us 
the agreement was amended in march to make its 
table of contents maturity april  however  at any time prior to that maturity  we can convert any or all outstanding balances into a series of month notes 
amounts converted into these notes are due in equal monthly installments 
the credit agreement is secured by essentially all of our domestic assets 
interest is payable monthly at the prime rate 
the credit agreement also provides that we may not incur or maintain indebtedness in excess of million without the prior written consent of the bank  except for borrowings related to the credit agreement 
as of april   we had approximately million outstanding under this agreement and million of the facility had been reserved to support outstanding letters of credit 
accordingly  approximately million was available under the facility as of that date 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us  among other things  to maintain a maximum debt to shareholders equity ratio  maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities ratio and produce quarterly earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of not less than a specified amount 
we are in compliance with all of these covenants as more fully described as follows actual as of january  or for description of financial covenant required amount period then ended ratio of debt to shareholder s equity not more than ratio of current assets to current liabilities not less than quarterly ebitda not less than million million on march   we acquired aes for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the consideration consisted of approximately million of cash at closing  approximately million in promissory notes and approximately  in deferred cash payments 
the promissory notes bear interest at annually  payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the notes is repayable in two equal installments on march  and the deferred cash payments will be made upon the expiration of certain indemnity periods 
we may offset amounts due pursuant to the promissory notes or the deferred cash payments against indemnity claims due from the sellers 
in addition  the sellers may be entitled to additional cash payments of up to approximately  should aes attain certain levels of revenues during the month period following the closing 
pursuant to our exclusive equipment lease agreement with sercel see part i item business we have agreed to purchase certain amounts of equipment through december  as of january  we had purchased or placed non cancellable orders for a portion of that equipment  which amounts are reflected in the table of contractual obligations below 
in order to fulfill the required purchases under the agreement we will be required to place orders for approximately million of additional equipment through december  should we fail to meet these obligations  sercel will have the right to terminate the agreement  including our exclusive referral arrangement 
the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total at january   we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million related to uncertain tax positions  including approximately million of non current income taxes payable 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when  if ever  these obligations will be paid 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and from proceeds of our existing working capital facility 

table of contents as of january   we had deposits in foreign banks equal to approximately million 
these funds may generally be transferred to our accounts in the united states without restriction 
however  the transfer of these funds may result in withholding taxes payable to foreign taxing authorities 
any such transfer taxes generally may be credited against our federal income tax obligations in the united states 
additionally  the transfer of funds from our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may result in currently taxable income in the united states 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to the allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence  the useful lives of our lease pool assets and amortizable intangible assets and the impairment assessments of our lease pool and various intangible assets 
other areas where we have made significant estimates include the valuation of stock options  the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets and the assessment of uncertain tax positions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition leases we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease unless there is a question as to whether it is collectible 
we do not enter into leases with embedded maintenance obligations 
under our standard lease  the customer is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment  excluding normal wear and tear 
we provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices 
in most situations  our customers pay shipping and handling costs directly to the shipping agents 
equipment sales we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from equipment sales upon agreement of terms and when delivery has occurred  unless there is a question as to its collectability 
we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally one to two years in duration 
long term project revenue from time to time  sap enters into contracts whereby it assembles and sales certain marine equipment  primarily to governmental entities 
performance under these contracts generally occurs over a period of several months 
revenue and costs related to these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a detailed review of outstanding receivable balances 
factors considered include the age of the receivable  the payment history of the customer  the general financial condition of the customer and any financial or operational leverage we may have in a particular situation 
we typically do not charge fees on past due accounts  although we reserve the right to do so in most of our contractual arrangements with our customers 
as of january   the average age of our accounts receivable was approximately days 
long lived assets we carry our lease pool of equipment and other property and equipment at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  and compute depreciation on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment  which range from two to years 
cables are depreciated over two years  geophones over three years  channel boxes over five to seven years and earth vibrators and other heavy equipment are depreciated over a year period 
buildings are depreciated over years  property improvements are amortized over years and 
table of contents leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of useful life and the life of the lease 
intangible assets are amortized from three to years 
the estimated useful lives for rental equipment are based on our experience as to the economic useful life of our products 
we review and consider industry trends in determining the appropriate useful life for our lease pool equipment  including technological obsolescence  market demand and actual historical useful service life of our lease pool equipment 
additionally  to the extent information is available publicly  we compare our depreciation policies to those of other companies in our industry for reasonableness 
when we purchase new equipment for our lease pool  we begin to depreciate it upon its first use and depreciation continues each month until the equipment is fully depreciated  whether or not the equipment is actually in use during that entire time period 
our policy regarding the removal of assets that are fully depreciated from our books is the following if an asset is fully depreciated and is still expected to generate revenue  then the asset will remain on our books 
however  if a fully depreciated asset is not expected to have any revenue generating capacity  then it is removed from our books 
in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a review of our lease pool assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we typically review all major categories of assets not each individual asset in our consolidated lease pool with remaining net book value to ascertain whether or not we believe that a particular asset group will generate sufficient cash flow over their remaining life to recover the remaining carrying value of those assets 
assets that we believe will not generate cash flow sufficient to cover the remaining net book value are subject to impairment 
we make our assessments based on customer demand  current market trends and market value of our equipment to determine if it will be able to recover its remaining net book value from future leasing or sales 
goodwill and other intangible assets we carry our amortizable intangible assets at cost  net of accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed on a straight line method over the estimated life of the asset 
currently  proprietary rights are amortized over a to year period  while covenants not to compete are amortized over a three year period 
the basis for the proprietary right lives are generally based upon the results of valuation reports commissioned from third parties 
covenants not to compete are amortized over the term of the contract 
goodwill is not subject to systematic amortization  but rather is tested for impairment annually 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we perform an impairment test on goodwill and other intangibles on an annual basis and at any time circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing compares the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets with their fair value 
when the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 
all of our goodwill and other intangible assets relate to our seamap segment  accordingly  we estimate fair value based upon estimated discounted cash flows of that segment 
in performing the analysis of discounted cash flows  we projected cash flow from the seamap segment for the next four fiscal years 
to determine the value of cash flows beyond the fourth year  we applied a terminal value which is expressed as a multiple of the fourth year s cash flow 
these cash flow streams are then discounted using our estimated cost of capital 
the key variables utilized in this analysis are i the level of projected cash flows  including the growth rate for the cash flows  ii the terminal value applied to the estimated cash flows and iii our cost of capital 
the sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in these assumptions is indicated in the following table variable decrease in fair value decrease in projected annual cash flow million decrease in terminal value applied to the estimated fourth year cash flow million basis point increase in cost of capital these changes in assumptions  individually and in the aggregate  would not have altered our conclusion that there was no impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  
table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we have assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
under asc  income taxes asc  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carry forward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider the following positive indicators the current level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities resulting from historically high prices for oil and natural gas  increasing world demand for oil  our recent history of profitable operations in various jurisdictions  our anticipated positive income in various jurisdictions  and our existing customer relationships 
we also considered the following negative indicators the risk of the world oil supply increasing  thereby depressing the price of oil and natural gas  the risk of decreased global demand for oil  and the potential for increased competition in the seismic equipment leasing and sales business 
based on our evaluation of the evidence  as of january  and we did not provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc is a two step process 
in the first step  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
in the second step  a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or both and 
the evaluation of tax positions and the measurement of the related benefit require significant judgment on the part of management 
we adopted provisions of the authoritative guidance included in acs effective february  as a result of the adoption we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax assets in the amount of approximately 
table of contents million  recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million and decreased the february  balance in retained earnings by approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation effective february   we adopted the provisions of authoritative guidance included in asc compensation stock compensation asc  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  stock based compensation expense recognized for share based awards includes i compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance in effect prior to february of  and ii compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of authoritative guidance included in asc determining the grant date fair value under both asc and prior authoritative guidance requires management to make estimates regarding the variables used in the calculation of the grant date fair value 
those variables are the future volatility of our common stock price  the length of time an optionee will hold their options until exercising them the expected term  and the number of options or shares that will be forfeited before they are exercised the forfeiture rate 
we utilize various mathematical models in calculating the variables 
share based compensation expense could be different if we used different models to calculate the variables 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered  nor do we intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of foreign locations  which gives rise to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to the extent possible  we attempt to denominate our transactions in foreign locations in us dollars 
for those cases in which transactions are not denominated in us dollars  we are exposed to risk from changes in exchange rates to the extent that non us dollar revenues exceed non us dollar expenses related to those operations 
our non us dollar transactions are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling  russian rubles  canadian dollars  australian dollars and singapore dollars 
as a result of these transactions  we generally hold cash balances that are denominated in these foreign currencies 
at january   our consolidated cash and cash equivalents included foreign currency denominated amounts equivalent to approximately million in us dollars 
a increase in the us dollar as compared to each of these currencies would result in a loss of approximately  in the us dollar value of these deposits  while a decrease would result in an equal amount of gain 
we do not currently hold or issue foreign exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge these exposures 
some of our foreign operations are conducted through wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
we currently have subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  russian ruble  australian dollar and the singapore dollar 
assets and liabilities from these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gains or losses are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
approximately of our net assets were impacted by changes in foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
during the year ended january   the us dollar generally decreased in value versus the above currencies 
as a result of this decline  we have recognized an increase of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income  primarily related to changes in the relative exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar  british pound sterling and the australian dollar 

table of contents interest rate risk as of january  there was approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
this agreement contains a floating interest rate based on the prime rate which was as of january  assuming the outstanding balance remains unchanged  a change of basis points in the prime rate would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately  we have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements in the past  and have no plans to do so 
do to fluctuating balances in the amount outstanding under this debt agreement we do not believe such arrangements to be cost effective
