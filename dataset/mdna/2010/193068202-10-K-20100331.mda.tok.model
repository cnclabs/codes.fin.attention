overview coldwater creek is a specialty retailer of women s apparel  accessories  jewelry and gift items 
founded in as a catalog company  today we are a multi channel specialty retailer generating sales through our retail stores  as well as our catalog and e commerce channels 
our proprietary merchandise assortment reflects a sophisticated yet relaxed and casual lifestyle 
a commitment to providing superior customer service is manifest in all aspects of our business

we currently have two operating segments retail and direct 
retail sales consist of sales generated at our premium retail stores and outlet stores along with our day spa locations 
direct sales consist of sales generated through our e commerce web site and from orders taken over the phone or through the mail 
executive summary during fiscal  our gross margin and results of operations were negatively impacted by a merchandise selection that we believe was too basic  did not differentiate us from our competitors and was weighted toward categories with lower price points 
in addition  although successful at driving traffic and sales  the combination of extensive value pricing  promotional discounting and quarterly sales events that did not meet our expectations led to a deterioration in our gross margin and results of operations 
low inventory levels during the first half of fiscal also negatively impacted the results of our summer sales event 
we define promotional discounts generally as temporary offerings 
these include coupons and in store promotions to customers for specified dollar or percentage discounts 

table of contents net sales increased to  million in fiscal compared to  million in fiscal this percent increase in net sales for the year was primarily driven by the addition of eight premium retail stores and two merchandise clearance outlet stores since january   offset by the closure of one merchandise clearance outlet store in the second quarter of fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our aggregate quarterly comparable premium retail store sales and a decrease in sales through our direct segment 
our gross margin rate for fiscal was percent  compared with percent in fiscal this percentage point decrease in the gross margin rate was primarily driven by a percentage point decline in our merchandise margins and a percentage point decline in leveraging of occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  compared with million  or percent of net sales  for fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million was primarily related to a decrease in employee expenses  lower marketing expenses  and lower overhead costs  partially offset by a million pre tax charge related to the departure of our former ceo 
we ended fiscal with million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at the prior year end 
working capital was million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal premium retail inventory  including the retail inventory in our distribution center  increased percent per square foot compared to fiscal total inventory increased percent to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this increase is attributable to inventory that was bought to support a more aggressive comparable store sales plan  the timing of spring inventory receipts relative to fiscal and a percent increase in premium retail store square footage 
outlook although macroeconomic conditions have improved to some extent  weak consumer spending has been prolonged with persisting concerns about high unemployment  income and deterioration in household net worth 
as long as these conditions continue we expect that consumer spending will remain difficult 
we remain cautious about fiscal year given the current environment  but we are implementing initiatives to position us for improved performance 
our initiatives in will be focused on improving our average unit retail prices and our average transaction value 
these initiatives will include refining our merchandise mix  adjusting our discounting cadence and modifying our approach to our quarterly sales events 
over the last two years we shifted our merchandise assortment to more basic items in a broad range of colors and styles  and away from our core strength of a diverse assortment across a variety of categories 
because we recognize that our customers are focused on fashion and differentiation  we have refocused our efforts to deliver unique and differentiated offerings creating a better balance of novelty items together with basic items in an effort to increase our average unit retail  average transaction dollars and gross margins 
these adjustments will begin to be reflected in our spring and summer collections  with the full impact of this initiative in place by september we are also focused on expanding and upgrading our home and jewelry categories as we believe there is an opportunity to increase their contribution to our operating results 
we believe that lower price points will continue to play a role in our customers purchasing decisions and we will continue to offer certain merchandise at lower opening price points as a component of our product offering  but we will reduce the breadth of these price points within our assortment 
during the second half of fiscal year we began testing higher price points on certain merchandise categories  and as a result  we are selectively raising price points to properly reflect the unique quality and design of our merchandise to increase our initial markup 
we also recognize that in 
table of contents the current economic environment discounts are an effective driver of traffic and we will continue to offer targeted promotions through our catalogs and email campaigns  although we will adjust the magnitude and timing of these promotions 
we have also adjusted our approach to our sales events as we have discovered over the last year that our customers are not responding to these events as they have in the past  resulting in a decrease in our merchandise margins 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took a sharper first markdown and reduced the duration of the sales event  which we believe improved the productivity of our sales events 
given the results  we expect to continue a similar strategy going forward 
we are also making efforts to restore our direct segment business  which has significantly deteriorated over the past two years  largely due to our decision to reduce catalog circulation in response to economic conditions 
we believe we have the opportunity to regain market share by selectively increasing catalog circulation 
in the second half of fiscal  we increased our catalog circulation by percent to million  compared to million in the second half of as a result of this increase we saw meaningful growth in reactivated customers 
we are also seeking to enhance the effectiveness of our internet marketing with one to one marketing initiatives as we work to personalize our messaging and make the experience more relevant to the customer 
during fiscal year  following two years of declining inventory levels  we invested in higher levels of inventory beginning in the fall season of and continuing into the first half of this investment was based on an increased sales plan that did not materialize to our expectations 
we have also purchased our spring and summer assortments at levels above our fiscal comparable stores sales plan 
though we currently have excess inventory  we are committed to the right sizing of our inventory levels by the second half of consequently  our performance in the first half of fiscal year will continue to be impacted by lower merchandise margins as a result of additional promotions to realign our inventory position 
we believe that the changes to our merchandise strategy  rebalancing of our pricing strategy  adjustment of our promotional cadence and sale events  and restoration of our direct segment business will position the company for improved long term performance and growth 
we continue to believe that our retail expansion will be a key driver for our long term growth 
however  we intend to pursue a scaled back store rollout program compared to the years prior to  until the economic outlook improves 
during fiscal  we opened new stores  ending the year with premium retail stores and merchandise clearance outlet stores 
we plan to open approximately new retail stores in fiscal other developments income tax valuation allowance during fiscal we recorded a million non cash income tax charge in continuing operations  or per share  related to a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
us gaap requires that we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its projected future performance 
consequently  based on available evidence  in particular our three year historical cumulative losses  we recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
the recording of a valuation allowance has no impact on cash and does not preclude us from utilizing the full amount of the deferred tax asset in future profitable periods 
we define markdowns generally as permanent reductions from the original selling price

pence  chairman of the board of directors  was appointed president and chief executive officer of coldwater creek  replacing daniel griesemer

net sales net sales consist of retail and direct sales  which include co branded credit card program marketing fees  revenue sharing and sales royalty revenue and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise 
the percent increase in net sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily driven by the addition of eight premium retail stores and two merchandise clearance outlet stores  slightly offset by the closure of one merchandise clearance outlet store and a 
table of contents decrease in comparable premium retail store sales as a result of lower average transaction value 
we experienced a decrease in sales through our direct segment as a result of lower average order values offset by lower sales returns 
we believe our sales performance for fiscal was negatively impacted by difficult macroeconomic conditions  low retail store traffic levels in the first two quarters of fiscal  the expansion of our value pricing initiatives  merchandise that did not differentiate us enough from our competitors  promotional discounting and quarterly sales events that did not meet our expectations 
comparable premium retail store sales by quarter is as follows percentage increase decrease premium retail store base fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter revenue from our co branded credit card program increased million for fiscal as compared with fiscal the amount of revenue sharing recognized as revenue during fiscal and fiscal was approximately million and million  respectively

these decreases were offset by lower shipping and handling costs of percentage points due to lower direct sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  decreased million during fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily driven by decreased employee  marketing and certain overhead expenses related to our cost savings initiatives 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a decreased by percentage points in fiscal as compared with fiscal this decrease in sg a rate was primarily the result of a percentage point decrease in employee expenses 
also contributing to the decrease in sg a rate was a percentage point decline in both marketing expenses and certain overhead costs 
we define comparable premium retail stores as those stores in which the gross square footage has not changed by more than percent in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months provided that store has been considered comparable for the entire quarter without closure for seven consecutive days or moving to a different temporary or permanent location 
due to the extensive promotions that occur as part of the opening of a premium store  we believe waiting sixteen months rather than twelve months to consider a store to be comparable provides a better view of the growth pattern of the premium retail store base 
the calculation of comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and as a result  the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation

direct segment net sales direct segment net sales decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal sales through our internet channel decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales from our phone and mail channel for the same period decreased million  from million to million 
the decrease in internet business net sales is primarily due to fewer orders over the internet  fewer catalogs mailed  and an approximate percent decrease in average transaction value during fiscal as a result of higher levels of internet markdowns 
the decrease in phone and mail businesses net sales was also impacted by fewer orders and less catalogs mailed in addition to an approximate percent decrease in average transaction value during fiscal as compared to fiscal phone and mail net sales are derived from orders taken from customers over the phone or through the mail 
catalogs are used as a brand marketing vehicle to drive sales in all channels and we encourage customers to choose the channel they deem most convenient 
sales made through other channels that we believe were driven by the initial receipt of a catalog are not included in phone and mail net sales 
consequently  as customers choose to purchase merchandise through other channels  we expect catalog business net sales to continue to generally decrease as a percent of total net sales

seasonality as with many apparel retailers  our net sales  operating results  liquidity and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including the following the composition  size and timing of various merchandise offerings  the number and timing of premium retail store openings  the timing of catalog mailings and the number of catalogs mailed  the timing of promotions  customer response to merchandise offerings  including the impact of economic and weather related influences  the actions of competitors and similar factors  overall merchandise return rates  including the impact of actual or perceived service and quality issues  our ability to accurately estimate and accrue for merchandise returns and to recover the cost of our merchandise  market price fluctuations in critical materials and services  including paper  production  postage and telecommunications costs  the timing of merchandise receiving and shipping  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine s day  easter  mother s day  thanksgiving and christmas 

table of contents our business materially depends on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforce 
additionally  as gift items and accessories are more prominently represented in the november and december holiday season merchandise offerings  we typically expect  absent offsetting factors  to realize higher consolidated gross margins and earnings in the second half of our fiscal year 
if  for any reason  we were to realize significantly lower than expected sales or profits during the november and december holiday selling season  as we did in fiscal years  and  our financial condition  results of operations  including related gross margins and cash flows  for the entire fiscal year will be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources in recent fiscal years  we financed ongoing operations and growth initiatives primarily from cash flow generated by operations  trade credit arrangements and the proceeds from our may public offering of common stock 
however  as we produce catalogs  open retail stores and purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales realization  and as operating cash flows and working capital experience fluctuations  we may occasionally utilize our bank credit facility 
on february   we entered into a secured credit agreement the agreement with wells fargo retail finance  llc

we also experienced a decrease in cash collected on tenant allowances of million as total cash collected on tenant allowances was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal in addition  we made a cash severance payment of million to our former ceo and we experienced a million decrease in interest income collected 
these decreases were offset by lower operating expenses  reduced marketing costs and an increase of million in fees collected from the co branded credit card program  which includes a million payment received related to the revenue sharing component of our co branded credit card program and a million increase in tax refunds received 
on a comparative year to year basis  the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from lower operating expenses  reduced payments on inventory purchases  reduced marketing costs and taxes received of million in fiscal versus taxes paid of million in fiscal we also experienced an increase in cash collected on tenant allowances of million as total cash collected was million in fiscal as compared

as a result of the foregoing  we had million in working capital at january   compared with million at january  our current ratio was at january   compared with at january  during fiscal year  following two years of declining inventory levels  we invested in higher levels of inventory beginning in the fall season of and continuing into the first half of this investment was based on an increased sales plan that did not materialize to our expectations 
we have also purchased our spring and summer assortments at levels above our fiscal comparable stores sales plan 
though we currently have excess inventory  we are committed to the right sizing of our inventory levels by the second half of consequently  our performance in the first half of fiscal year will continue to be impacted by lower merchandise margins as a result of additional promotions to realign our inventory position 
capital expenditures for the full year in fiscal are expected to be approximately million  primarily associated with the premium retail store expansion  store related expenditures  investments in information technology and  to a lesser extent  other corporate related capital expenditures 

table of contents the deterioration of the financial  credit and housing markets combined with high unemployment has led to declines in consumer confidence  reduced credit availability  and liquidity concerns 
we have factored these considerations into our business plans and have responded by implementing cost and capital savings initiatives 
in addition  we have invested our cash deposits in us treasury bills and money market funds that are invested in us treasury securities 
we do not anticipate borrowing under our credit facility during fiscal as we believe cash flow from operations and current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund current needs 
however  lower than expected sales or lower merchandise margins that negatively impact our cash flows could require us to borrow under our credit facility 
it is also possible that due to the impact of worsening economic conditions on our business  should we need to access our credit facility  it may not be available in full  or at all  for future borrowings  due to borrowing base and other limitations 
off balance sheet liabilities and other contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of january  in thousands payments due in fiscal year total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases a contractual commitments b capital leases c other financing obligations d other long term liabilities e f total a we lease retail store space as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
retail store leases require the payment of additional rent based on sales above a specified minimum 
the operating lease obligations noted above do not include any contingent rental expense we may incur based on future sales above the specified minimums or payments made for maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
several lease agreements provide lease renewal options 
future operating lease obligations would change if these renewal options were exercised 
b contractual commitments include inventory purchase orders of million and capital expenditure purchase orders of million 
we expect to pay substantially all of these commitments in the next twelve months 
the actual timing of the payments is subject to change based upon actual receipt of the inventory or capital asset and the terms of payment with the vendor 
c the weighted average interest rate on the capital leases is approximately percent 
payments represent the principal and accrued interest of million and interest expense to be incurred of approximately million 
d payments on other financing obligations represent interest expense to be incurred of approximately million and principal amounts due in the next twelve months of approximately million which has been recorded as a current liability 
e other long term liabilities include amounts on our january  consolidated balance sheet representing obligations under our supplemental employee retirement plan of million and asset retirement obligations under certain of our lease arrangements of million 
although we do not expect to pay any cash out in the next twelve months  the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is uncertain and subject to change based upon circumstances not necessarily within our control 
in addition  other long term liabilities include million related to our employee retention compensation program which will be paid during the next twelve months 
this does not include million of additional compensation expense that is to be recognized over the employees remaining service periods 

table of contents f we have excluded million and million of deferred rents and deferred revenue  respectively  from the other long term liabilities in the above table 
these amounts have been excluded because deferred rents relate to operating leases  which are already reflected in the operating lease category above and the deferred revenue does not represent a contractual obligation that will be settled in cash 
our only individually significant operating lease is for our  square foot distribution center and customer contact center located in mineral wells  west virginia 
our remaining lease commitment as of january  is approximately million and has been reflected in the schedule above 
all other operating leases primarily pertain to retail and outlet stores  day spas and to various equipment and technology 
subsequent to january   we entered into additional retail leases with minimum lease payment requirements  and as a result  as of march  our operating lease commitments increased by million 
as of january  we had million in letters of credit issued  of which million was issued under our credit facility with wells fargo retail finance  llc 
related to inventory purchase commitments and million under a separate letter of credit related to our distribution facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
sales returns we recognize sales and the related cost of sales for our direct segment at the time the merchandise is expected to be delivered to our customer and for our retail segment at the point of sale with a customer in a store 
we reduce our sales and costs of sales and establish an accrual for expected sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations 
the ability to reasonably estimate sales returns is made more complex by the fact that we offer our customers a return policy whereby they may return merchandise for any reason and at any time without any restrictions as to condition or time of purchase to any of our locations 
the actual amount of sales returns we subsequently realize may fluctuate from estimates due to several factors  including size and fit  merchandise mix  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in the catalog or web site  timeliness of delivery and competitive offerings 
we continually track subsequent sales return experience  compile customer feedback to identify any pervasive issues  reassess the marketplace  compare our findings to previous estimates and adjust the sales return accrual and cost of sales accordingly 
provisions for sales returns were as follows in thousands balance at beginning of period additions charged to net loss deductions for actual returns current year adjustments to prior year reserve balance at end of period fiscal year ended february  january  january  
table of contents inventory valuation our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the nature of our business requires that we make substantially all of our merchandising and marketing decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings 
these decisions and commitments are based upon  among other possible considerations  historical sales with identical or similar merchandise  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  and an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually make assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value  and  if so  by what dollar amount 
to determine whether inventory should be written down we consider current and anticipated demand and customer preferences in addition to the current and future estimated selling price 
the carrying value of the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to cost of sales 
during the last three years we have experienced declining gross margins due to an increase in the amount of inventory being sold with markdowns and promotional discounts 
during fiscal  we experienced significantly lower customer traffic than originally anticipated  which resulted in an increase in slow moving and aged inventory and led us to record an approximate million write down of overstock inventory that was liquidated through third parties 
during fiscal we purchased inventory based on an increased sales plan that did not materialize 
as a result  we will dispose of this excess inventory internally through various promotional offerings and through our outlets and web site at lower margins than originally planned 
we have made loss provisions for certain inventory items as of january  that we believe are adequate based upon current forecasts which consider current and future selling prices 
actual results may differ from our estimates if we are required to markdown or discount merchandise beyond our current expectations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is accounted for according to asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based upon the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeitures 
to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the immediate future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon a combination of both the implied and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based upon the exercise and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
if expected volatility or expected life were to increase  that would result in an increase in the fair value of our stock options 
table of contents which would result in higher compensation charges  while a decrease in volatility or the expected life would result in a lower fair value of our stock option awards resulting in lower compensation charges 
we also grant restricted stock units and common stock which are less subjective in determining fair value as the fair value of these awards is based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and not on an option pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures for all of our awards based upon historical experience of stock based pre vesting forfeitures 
we believe that our estimates are based upon outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
if actual forfeitures are higher than our estimates it would result in lower compensation expense and to the extent the actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate we would record higher compensation expense 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  more specifically leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures at our retail stores and day spas  are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  we then determine the fair value of the asset using a discounted cash flow model 
a loss is recognized  if any  for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value 
in assessing these future cash flows  management is required to make assumptions and judgments  including future sales  margin and operating expenses 
these assumptions and judgments can be affected by consumer spending and overall economic conditions on a localized or regional basis  as well as other factors not necessarily within our control 
the deterioration of the financial  credit  and housing markets have had a severe impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending 
these market conditions have had a negative effect on our business resulting in us evaluating certain retail stores for impairment as of january  during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the long lived assets of certain premium retail stores 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the long lived assets of certain day spa locations within our retail segment 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the long lived assets at certain premium retail stores 
if market conditions were to deteriorate for an extended period of time  it is possible that we could record additional impairments of certain long lived assets in the future 
contingent liabilities an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
we are involved in litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
actions filed against us from time to time include commercial  intellectual property infringement  customer and employment claims  including class action lawsuits alleging that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws 
if the recognition criteria have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
the assessment of the outcome of litigation can be very difficult to predict as it is subject to many factors  including those not within our control  and is highly dependent on individual facts and circumstances 
litigation is subject to highly complex legal processes and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been recorded in the financial statements 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under asc  income taxes asc 
in accordance with asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and respective tax bases  as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods where deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
we consider all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its projected future performance 
consequently  based on all available evidence  in particular our three year historical cumulative losses and recent operating losses  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset with corresponding charges of million to tax expense and million to other comprehensive income during fiscal as a result  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of january  was million 
when the results of our operations demonstrate a sustained level of taxable income it may become more likely than not that all or a part of the net deferred tax assets will be realized which could result in the reduction of the valuation allowance 
the determination of when to reduce a valuation allowance requires significant judgment by management in determining the appropriate level of evidence to objectively support the realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance activity on deferred tax assets was as follows in thousands balance at beginning of period additions charged to income tax expense reductions credited to income tax expense current year adjustments to prior year reserve other adjustments to comprehensive loss balance at end of period fiscal year ended february  january  january  recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars or us dollar based currencies 
we have been immaterially impacted by fluctuations in interest rates as a result of our relatively modest bank borrowings in recent fiscal years 
during the twelve month period ended january   we did not have borrowings under our credit facility and  consequently  did not have any material exposure to interest rate market risks during or at the end of this period 
however  as any future borrowings under our amended and restated bank credit facility will be at a variable rate of interest  we could potentially be materially adversely impacted should we require significant borrowings in the future  particularly during a period of rising interest rates 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments
