item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the company s subsidiaries are listed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million in the prior year 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence in the gulf or damage production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events  supply and demand of products  product storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production through the use of financial instruments 

table of contents if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the successful wells and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing 
the company has in place both a stock repurchase program and a limited partnership interest repurchase program 
spending under these programs in was thousand 
the company expects continue spending under these programs in the company currently maintains two credit facilities totaling million  with a combined current borrowing base of million 
the bank reviews the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and we are subject to certain financial covenants defined in the agreement 
we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
during the second quarter of  the company s offshore subsidiary arranged a subordinated credit facility with a private lender controlled by a director of the company 
the facility provides availability of million and is secured by properties released by the bank and pledged under this agreement 
the current advances under this credit facility are million due january it is the goal of the company to increase its oil and gas reserves and production through the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
the company also continues to explore and consider opportunities to further expand its oilfield servicing revenues through additional investment in field service equipment 
however  the majority of the company s capital spending is discretionary  and the ultimate level of expenditures will be dependent on the company s assessment of the oil and gas business environment  the number and quality of oil and gas prospects available  the market for oilfield services  and oil and gas business opportunities in general 
results of operations as compared to the company had a net loss of  in as compared to net income of  in the significant components of net income are discussed below 
oil and gas sales were  in as compared to  in a chart summarizing oil and gas production and revenue is presented below 
increase decrease barrels of oil produced average price received rounded  including the impact of derivatives oil revenue mcf of gas produced average price received rounded  including the impact of derivatives gas revenue total oil gas revenue 
table of contents oil gas prices received excluding the impact of derivatives were increase decrease oil price gas price changes in production related to gas are primarily due to the natural decline in our offshore properties 
the oil production remained relatively stable as a result of the additional properties added throughout field service income decreased by to  in from  in as a result of reduced utilization of equipment combined with rate decreases 
field service expense decreased by to  in from  in this decrease is the result of reduced labor and operating costs associated with the drop in equipment utilization in lease operating expenses decreased by to  in from  in due to overall price decreases in oil field services combined with reduced production taxes related to commodity prices 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to  in from  in this decrease is primarily due to reductions in personnel costs 
depreciation and depletion decreased by to  in from  in this decrease is primarily related to the decrease in offshore production in interest expense decreased by to  in from  in this decrease is due to lower outstanding debt balances during the year and slightly lower average interest rates 
the average interest rates paid on outstanding bank borrowings subject to interest during and were and respectively 
as of december  and  the total outstanding borrowings were  and  respectively 
income tax benefit of  was recorded for  including a reduction of  in the company s deferred tax liability 
the company expects to have a net operating loss on the federal income tax return  and to carry this loss back to offset previous year tax liabilities and receive a refund of approximately  item a
