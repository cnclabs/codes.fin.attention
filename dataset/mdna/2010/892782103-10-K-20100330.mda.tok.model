security charges are charges to cover the company s additional expenses required to ensure the safety of the shipper s cargo 
these charges amounted to million in compared to million in operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million  or from million for to million for this decrease was due primarily to lower inland and marine variable costs due to lower volumes and decreases in the market price of fuel 
fuel expenses in decreased million  or  due to significant decreases in the market price of fuel combined with decreased consumption due to one less tbc in liner service during half of the year in when compared to rent and purchased transportation decreased by million or due partially to tug charter rent for an additional tbc in service during the first half of and decreases in cargo volumes and fuel related components of inland purchased transportation

the company has determined that its marine operations and inland transportation related to marine operations qualify for the tonnage tax 
in the second quarter of  the company completed its analysis of the impact of making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime 
the analysis illustrated that using the tonnage tax method would reduce the company s cash outlay related to federal income taxes 
for federal tax purposes  the company can satisfy only of its amt alternative minimum taxable income with its net operating loss carryforwards nol and  therefore  results in a much larger cash outlay in comparison to the required payments associated with the tonnage tax regime 
as a result of this analysis  the company determined that it would be making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime on its federal tax return

off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s most critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  services for freight in transit at the end of a reporting period the company recognizes voyage revenue ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method 
voyage expenses are recognized as incurred 
fuel and other surcharges  demurrage and charterhire revenue are included in our revenues 
net demurrage is a charge assessed for failure to return empty freight equipment on time less a demurrage related allowance for bad debt 
charter hire is rental revenue for vessels not in use in a liner service 
the company recognizes demurrage and charterhire revenue based on negotiated fees included in the contracts of our customers 
these amounts are computed daily and included in operating revenue 
useful life and salvage values 
the company reviews the selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating our property and equipment 
depreciable lives of property and equipment range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sales are based on the expected values of equipment at the time of disposal 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately  the gain or losses on the disposal of the asset 
repairs and maintenance 
the company expenses repairs and maintenance as incurred 
every five years the company s vessels are required to go through regulatory dry docking 
the company elected  in 
table of contents a prior year  to account for its dry docking costs using the expense as incurred method as opposed to the defer and amortize method predominantly used by the company s industry peer group 
the company elected the expense as incurred method for accounting for these required regulatory dry docking costs as it is the method preferred by the securities and exchange commission 
using the expense as incurred method  the company recorded dry docking expenses of   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
had the company used the defer and amortize method such expenses would have been amortized over the five year period between regulatory dry dockings 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to our carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  the company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  replacement costs of such assets  business plans and overall market conditions 
the company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows and compares it to the carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  the company would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value primarily through the use of appraisals or other valuation techniques 
the company recognized no impairments in  or uncollectible accounts 
the company records a monthly provision based on specific known collectability problems  historical losses  and current economic information 
in addition  the company performs an analysis of the total receivables on a quarterly basis  including review of historical collection trends  and adjusts the provision account each quarter 
it is the company s policy to write off receivables once it is determined that additional efforts of collection will not result in the collection of the receivable 
income taxes 
the american jobs creation act of instituted an elective tonnage tax regime whereby a corporation may elect to pay a tonnage tax based upon the net tonnage of its qualifying us flag vessels rather than the traditional us corporate income tax on the taxable income from such vessels and related inland service 
the company has determined that its marine operations and inland transportation related to marine operations qualify for the tonnage tax 
in the second quarter of  the company completed its analysis of the impact of making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime 
the analysis illustrated that using the tonnage tax method would reduce the company s cash outlay related to federal income taxes  for federal tax purposes  the company can satisfy only of its alternative minimum taxable amt income with its net operating loss carryforwards nol s and  therefore  results in a much larger cash outlay in comparison to the required payments associated with the tonnage tax regime 
as a result of this analysis  the company made the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime on its federal tax return 
the federal tax expense related to under the tonnage tax method is estimated to be approximately  the remaining deferred tax asset of approximately  represents the state portion of the company s deferred tax asset 
the company s research of the tonnage tax suggests that states do not recognize the tonnage tax and  therefore  nol s related to state qualifying shipping income would not be suspended 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin included in asc  income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return

for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be 
table of contents sustained  the company has recognized the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the company s financial statements 
the company performed a review of its uncertain tax positions and concluded that there were no significant adjustments required related to uncertain tax positions as of december  and the company has no accrued interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
interest and penalties  if incurred  would be recognized as a component of income tax expense 
the company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized position over the next months 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and each state jurisdiction in which it operates which imposes an income tax 
the company has not been subject to internal revenue service irs examination of its federal income tax returns
