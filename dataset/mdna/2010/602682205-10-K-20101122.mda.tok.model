table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mindspeed technologies  inc we or mindspeed designs  develops and sells semiconductor solutions for communications applications in the wireline and wireless network infrastructure  which includes enterprise networks  broadband access networks fixed and mobile and metropolitan and wide area networks 
we have organized our solutions for these interrelated and rapidly converging networks into three product families communications convergence processing formerly known as multiservice access  high performance analog and wide area networking communications 
our communications convergence processing products include ultra low power  multi core digital signal processor dsp system on chip soc products for the fixed and mobile g g carrier infrastructure and residential and enterprise platforms 
our high performance analog products include high density crosspoint switches  optical drivers  equalization and signal conditioning solutions that solve difficult switching  timing and synchronization challenges in next generation optical networking  enterprise storage and broadcast video transmission applications 
our wan communications portfolio helps optimize today s circuit switched networks that furnish much of the internet s underlying long distance infrastructure 
our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems for use in a variety of network infrastructure equipment  including communications convergence processing triple play edge and metro trunking gateways for voice over internet protocol voip platforms  broadband customer premises equipment cpe gateways and other equipment that carriers use to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers  internet protocol ip private branch exchange pbx equipment and security appliances used in the enterprise and g g mobile base stations in the carrier infrastructure  high performance analog next generation fiber access network equipment including passive optical networking  or pon  systems  storage and server systems supporting high speed pci express  serial attached scsi sas and infiniband protocols  and production switches  routers and other systems that are driving the migration to g high definition hd transmission  and wan communications circuit switched networking equipment that implements asynchronous transfer mode atm and t e and t e communications protocols 
our customers include alcatel lucent  cisco systems  inc  huawei technologies co 
ltd  hitachi ltd  lm ericsson telephone company  nokia siemens networks and zhongxing telecom equipment corp 
we report on a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to september fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on october  fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on october  fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on october  trends and factors affecting our business our products are components of network infrastructure equipment 
as a result  we rely on network infrastructure oems to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
these design wins are an integral part of the long sales cycle for our products 
our customers may need six months or longer to test and evaluate our products and an additional six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
we believe our close relationships with leading network infrastructure oems facilitate early adoption of our products during development of their products  enhance our ability to obtain design wins and encourage adoption of our technology by the industry 
we believe our diverse portfolio of semiconductor solutions has us well positioned to capitalize on some of the most significant trends in telecommunications spending  including next generation network convergence  voip fiber access deployment in developing and developed markets  g g wireless infrastructure build out  the adoption of higher speed interconnectivity solutions  and the migration of broadcast video to high definition 
we market and sell our semiconductor products directly to network infrastructure oems 
we also sell our products indirectly through electronic component distributors and third party electronic manufacturing service 
table of contents providers  who manufacture products incorporating our semiconductor networking solutions for oems 
sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our revenues for fiscal our revenue is well diversified globally  with of fiscal revenue coming from outside of the americas 
we believe a portion of the products we sell to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region is ultimately shipped to end markets in the americas and europe 
we believe we are well situated in china  where fiber deployments are being rolled out by the country s major telecommunications carriers 
through our oem customers  we are shipping into the fiber to the building fttb deployments of china telecom  china unicom and china mobile 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of our revenue was derived from china 
we have significant research  development  engineering and product design capabilities 
our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to make  substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the formulation of industry standards 
we spent approximately million on research and development in fiscal we seek to maximize our return on our research and development spending by focusing our research and development investment in what we believe are key growth markets  including voip and other high bandwidth multiservice access applications  high performance analog applications such as optical networking and broadcast video transmission  and wireless infrastructure solutions for base station processing 
we have developed and maintain a broad intellectual property portfolio  and we may periodically enter into strategic arrangements to leverage our portfolio by licensing or selling our intellectual property 
we are dependent upon third parties for the development  manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products 
our ability to bring new products to market  to fulfill orders and to achieve long term revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to obtain sufficient external manufacturing capacity  including wafer fabrication capacity 
periods of upturn in the semiconductor industry may be characterized by rapid increases in demand and a shortage of capacity for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
in such periods  we may experience longer lead times or indeterminate delivery schedules  which may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders for our products 
during periods of capacity shortages for manufacturing  assembly and testing services  our primary foundries and other suppliers may devote their limited capacity to fulfill the requirements of their other customers that are larger than we are  or who have superior contractual rights to enforce manufacture of their products  including to the exclusion of producing our products 
we may also incur increased manufacturing costs  including costs of finding acceptable alternative foundries or assembly and test service providers 
in order to achieve sustained profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses and or increase our revenues 
we have completed a series of cost reduction actions  which have improved our operating cost structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  when necessary 
our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend on increased demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers  the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we believe the market for network infrastructure equipment in general  and for communications semiconductors in particular  offers attractive long term growth prospects due to increasing demand for network capacity  the continued upgrading and expansion of existing networks and the build out of telecommunication networks in developing countries 
however  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
in addition  there has been an increasing trend toward industry consolidation  particularly among major network equipment and telecommunications companies 
consolidation in the industry has generally led to pricing pressure and loss of market share 
these factors have caused substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our results of operations in the past  and we may experience cyclical fluctuations in our business in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
table of contents amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to inventories  stock based compensation  revenue recognition  income taxes and impairment of long lived assets 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand generally over months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
our products are used by oems that have designed our products into network infrastructure equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
in the event that quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally are unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
we base our assessment of the recoverability of our inventories  and the amounts of any write downs  on currently available information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
for the majority of our awards  we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting or the achievement of specific performance conditions 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we classify compensation expense related to these awards in our consolidated statement of operations based on the department to which the recipient reports 
revenue recognition our products are often integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements through our maintenance contracts for many of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
for sales of products where software is not included or is incidental to the equipment  we apply the provisions of asc  revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
we generate revenues from direct product sales  sales to distributors  maintenance contracts  development agreements and the sale and license of intellectual property 
we recognize revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  
table of contents iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
we recognize revenues on products shipped directly to customers at the time the products are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenues on sales to distributors based on the rights granted to these distributors in our distribution agreements 
we have certain distributors who have been granted return rights and receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers  the magnitude of which is not known at the time products are shipped to the distributor 
the return rights granted to these distributors consist of limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of the products in their inventory twice a year  as well as certain product return rights if the applicable distribution agreement is terminated 
these distributors also receive price concessions because they resell our products to end customers at various negotiated price points which vary by end customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive pricing environments 
when a distributor s resale is priced at a discount from the distributor s invoice price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of the distributor s original purchase price after the resale transaction is complete 
thus  a portion of the deferred income on sales to distributors balance will be credited back to the distributor in the future 
under these agreements  we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor  at which time our final net sales price is fixed and the distributor s right to return the products expires 
at the time of shipment to these distributors i we record a trade receivable at the invoiced selling price because there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  ii we relieve inventory for the carrying value of products shipped because legal title has passed to the distributor  and iii we record deferred revenue and deferred cost of inventory under the deferred income on sales to distributors caption in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the deferred cost of inventory component of this account for possible impairment by considering potential obsolescence of products that might be returned to us and by considering the potential of resale prices of these products being below our cost 
by reviewing deferred inventory costs in the manners discussed above  we ensure that any portion of deferred inventory costs that are not recoverable from future contractual revenue are charged to cost of sales as an expense 
deferred income on sales to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on sales to distributors  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods may be less than the originally recorded deferred income as a result of negotiated price concessions 
in recent years  such concessions have exceeded of list price on average 
for detail of this account balance  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenues from other distributors at the time of shipment and when title and risk of loss transfer to the distributor  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and when the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
these distributors may also be given business terms to return a portion of inventory  however they do not receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers 
at the time of shipment  product prices are fixed or determinable and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated and accrued 
revenue from the sale and license of intellectual property is recognized when the above mentioned four revenue recognition criteria are met 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and customer acceptance has been received and was not significant for any of the periods presented 
deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions we have provided a full valuation allowance against our u 
s federal and state deferred tax assets 
if sufficient positive evidence of our ability to generate future u 
s federal and or state taxable income becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we follow asc  income taxes  for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under asc  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income 
table of contents tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  the new interpretations provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly monitor and review long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  for impairment including whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment of certain long lived assets 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   we adopted asc  for the accounting of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlements  formerly fasb staff position apb this standard required retrospective adjustments to prior period financial statements to conform with current period accounting treatment 
accordingly  our prior period financial statements have been adjusted 
asc requires that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash be separated into a debt component and an equity component 
the value assigned to the debt component as of the issuance date is the estimated fair value of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature 
the difference between the proceeds obtained for the instruments and the estimated fair value assigned to the debt component represents the equity component 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of this accounting standard 
on october   we adopted asc a  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this authoritative guidance provides that before the completion of an award s requisite service period  all outstanding awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends in undistributed earnings with common stock are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share 
we determined that a limited number of our instruments granted in share based payment transactions contained rights to nonforfeitable dividends in undistributed earnings 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we amended the related instruments plan documents to eliminate this provision and therefore no longer have any instruments subject to this authoritative guidance 
we have determined that there is no impact to our presentation of earnings per share in any historical periods by including the limited number of applicable instruments prior to this plan amendment 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that expands the interim and annual disclosure requirements of fair value measurements  including the information about movement of assets between level and of the three tier fair value hierarchy established under its fair value measurement guidance 
this guidance also requires separate disclosure for purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs using level methodologies 
we adopted the relevant provisions of this guidance  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb reached a consensus on the milestone method of revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
a vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a 
table of contents milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on accounting standards update  or asu   revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu and asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu modifies the requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  or ii third party evidence tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to items that have already been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenues fiscal compared to fiscal  fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes our net revenues change change dollars in millions communications convergence processing products high performance analog products wan communications products intellectual property net revenues for fiscal  the increase in our net revenues compared to fiscal mainly reflects higher sales volume in all three of our product families  as well as an increase in the sales and licensing of our intellectual property 
net revenues from our communications convergence processing products increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  mainly reflecting an increase in shipments of our cpe products  which are used in broadband home gateways and other equipment used by service providers in fiber to the home deployments in order to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers 
within communications convergence processing  we also experienced an increase in shipments for fttb deployments  particularly to customers in china 
net revenues from our high performance analog products increased million  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal due primarily to increased demand for crosspoint switches primarily related to strength in the optical transport market and broadcast video market  and increased demand for our physical media devices as we expanded into the gigabit passive optical networking gpon market 
net revenues from our wan communications products increased million  or  mainly reflecting an increase in shipments of our network processor products and our carrier ethernet products in fiscal net revenues from intellectual property licensing and sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  
table of contents due to the sale of certain intellectual property in two significant transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal we have developed and maintain a broad intellectual property portfolio  and we may periodically enter into strategic arrangements to leverage our portfolio by licensing or selling our patents 
the decrease in our net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal reflects declines in high performance analog products and wan communications products  as well as a decrease in revenues from the sale and licensing of intellectual property 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in revenues in our communications convergence processing products 
net revenues from our communications convergence processing products increased million  or  mainly reflecting an increase in shipments for fttb deployments  particularly in asia  partially offset by decreased demand at one of our large strategic north american customers 
we experienced increased sales volumes from our voip product families as telecommunication service providers install equipment to transmit their voice traffic over ip data networks 
we believe we benefited from the deployment of ip based networks both in new network buildouts and the replacement of circuit switched networks 
net revenues from our high performance analog products decreased million  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal within high performance analog  we experienced a benefit from increased demand for our crosspoint switches  which are used in telecommunications applications 
this benefit was offset by weak economic conditions affecting our physical media devices  which are used in infrastructure equipment for fiber to the premise deployments  metropolitan area networks and wide area networks 
net revenues from our wan communications products decreased million  or  mainly reflecting a significant decrease in demand due to weak economic conditions  particularly in north america and europe 
this decrease in demand was primarily in our atm mpls network processor products  our t e carrier transmission products and our carrier ethernet products 
net revenues from intellectual property licensing and sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the magnitude and timing of intellectual property sales 
gross margin change change dollars in millions gross margin percent of net revenues gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd  amkor technology  inc and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalty and other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead costs associated with product procurement  amortization of the cost of mask sets purchased  and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin for fiscal increased million from fiscal  principally reflecting an increase in both product and intellectual property revenues in fiscal  as well as the effect of asset impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal our fiscal product sales increased million  or  compared to fiscal and our sale or licensing of intellectual property increased million  or 
the increase in our gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the effect of asset impairment charges incurred in fiscal and increased sales of higher margin intellectual property in fiscal our gross margin for fiscal decreased million from fiscal  principally reflecting a decrease in revenues  as well as asset impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal our fiscal product sales decreased million  or  compared to fiscal and our sale or licensing of intellectual property decreased million  or 
the decrease in our gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the drop in revenues from the sale or licensing of intellectual property  which had little associated cost  as well as product mix changes and reduced levels of overhead absorption caused by a lower level of product sales in fiscal the decrease in gross margin in fiscal was also impacted by asset impairment charges of million recorded in fiscal asset impairments consisted of million related to the write down of the carrying value of technology developed by ample communications  inc  a million write down of ample communications related inventory and an approximate  write down of 
table of contents certain manufacturing related fixed assets 
gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal included an approximate negative effect from these asset impairments 
research and development change change dollars in millions research and development expenses percent of net revenues our research and development r d expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  photomasks  electronic design automation tools and pre production evaluation and test costs 
the  increase in r d expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by a million increase in compensation and personnel related costs  including stock compensation expense 
this increase is due to both a management bonus accrual in accordance with our fiscal cash bonus plan  as well as an increase in headcount within our communications convergence processing and high performance analog groups 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the cost of our facilities of almost million  which was mainly the result of entering into a new corporate headquarters lease at a more favorable rental rate than we had previously 
the million decrease in r d expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by a million decrease in compensation and personnel related costs mainly due to a focused effort to reduce costs associated with our workforce  including headcount reductions associated with our restructuring activities 
in addition  r d expenses in fiscal included  related to severance benefits payable to certain former employees as a result of organizational changes  which were not incurred in fiscal selling  general and administrative change change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of net revenues our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include personnel costs  independent sales representative commissions and product marketing  applications engineering and other marketing costs 
our sg a expenses also include costs of corporate functions  including accounting  finance  legal  human resources  information systems and communications 
the  decrease in our sg a expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a  decrease in the cost of our facilities  which was mainly due to our entering into a new corporate headquarters lease at a more favorable rental rate than we had previously 
in addition  the decrease in sg a in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to a decrease in the cost of our professional fees and insurance totaling approximately  these decreases in sg a expenses were mostly offset by an increase in compensation  including stock compensation expense  of approximately million 
the increase in compensation  including stock compensation expense  reflects a decrease in costs resulting from headcount reductions associated with our restructuring activities  which is more than offset by an increase in compensation expense related to a management bonus accrual in accordance with our fiscal cash bonus plan  as well as an increase in stock compensation expense 
the million decrease in our sg a expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflected a million decrease in compensation and personnel related costs  including stock compensation expense mainly due to a focused effort to reduce costs associated with our workforce  including headcount reductions associated with our restructuring activities 
in addition  sg a expenses decreased million as a result of decreased spending on professional fees in fiscal and a  decrease in commissions paid to our sales representatives 
in addition  sg a expense decreased  in fiscal due to a decrease in expenses incurred related to severance benefits payable to former officers and employees 

table of contents special charges special charges consist of the following dollars in millions asset impairments restructuring charges total special charges asset impairments during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  these impairment charges consisted of property and equipment that we determined to abandon or scrap 
during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of million 
included in this amount were asset impairment charges of approximately  related to software and property and equipment that we determined to abandon or scrap  as well as asset impairment charges of million to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to our acquisition of certain assets of ample communications 
in the second quarter of fiscal  our ample communications reporting unit experienced a severe decline in sales and profitability due to a significant decline in demand that we believe was a result of the downturn in global economic conditions  as well as a bankruptcy filed by the reporting unit s most significant customer 
the drop in market demand resulted in significant declines in unit sales 
due to these market and economic conditions  our ample communications reporting unit experienced a significant decline in market value 
as a result  we concluded that there were sufficient factual circumstances for interim impairment analyses 
accordingly  in the second quarter of fiscal  we performed a goodwill impairment assessment 
based on the results of our assessment of goodwill for impairment  we determined that the carrying value of the ample communications reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  we performed a second step of the impairment test to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the required analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill in the ample communications reporting unit and we impaired the entire goodwill balance of million 
we continually monitor and review long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  for possible impairment 
future impairment tests may result in significant write downs of the value of our assets 
restructuring charges we have from time to time  and may in the future  commit to restructuring plans to help manage our costs or to help implement strategic initiatives  among other reasons 
mindspeed fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to the implementation of a restructuring plan 
the plan consisted primarily of a targeted headcount reduction in our wan product family and selling  general and administrative functions

the gain on debt extinguishment was partially offset by a  decrease in interest income resulting from the lower cash and cash equivalents balance in fiscal year compared to fiscal year provision for income taxes dollars in millions provision for income taxes 
table of contents our provision for income taxes for fiscal year principally consisted of income tax due on operating income generated in the us a substantial portion of this operating income was offset by previously generated net operating losses  thereby reducing the effective tax rate on us earnings 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal years and principally consisted of income taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of october   we had a valuation allowance of million against our us federal and state deferred tax assets which reduces their carrying value to zero because we continue to believe that it is unlikely that we will realize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of future income tax payments 
we have considered both positive and negative evidence in reaching this determination and placed considerable weight upon the cumulative losses over the past three year period 
as of october   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  including the net operating loss carryforwards we retained in the distribution 
we can provide no assurances that we will be able to retain or fully utilize such net operating loss carryforwards  or that such net operating loss carryforwards will not be significantly limited in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from product sales and the sales or licensing of our intellectual property  and our line of credit with silicon valley bank

as of october   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and working capital was million 
in order to sustain profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses and or increase revenues 
we have completed a series of cost reduction actions  which have improved our operating expense structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  if necessary 
in addition  from time to time  we may commit to additional restructurings to help implement strategic initiatives 
these restructurings and other cost saving measures alone may not allow us to sustain the profitability we achieved in fiscal our ability to maintain  or increase  current revenue levels to sustain profitability will depend on demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers and enterprises  the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions  and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we may be unable to maintain  or increase current revenue levels or sustain past and future expense reductions in subsequent periods 
we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we believe that our existing cash balances  along with cash expected to be generated from product sales and the sale and licensing of intellectual property  will be sufficient to fund our operations  research and development efforts  anticipated capital expenditures  working capital and other financing requirements  including interest payments on debt obligations  for the next months 
in november  we repaid the million outstanding balance of our senior convertible notes  and we have no other principal payments on currently outstanding debt due in the next months 
from time to time  we may acquire our debt securities through privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  exchange offers for new debt or other securities  redemptions or otherwise  upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine appropriate 
we will need to continue a focused program of capital expenditures to meet our research and development and corporate requirements 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
in order to fund capital expenditures  increase our working capital or complete any acquisitions  we may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
we may also need to seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated or if we fail to achieve anticipated revenue and expense levels 
however  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  particularly in light of recent economic conditions in the capital markets

rent payable under the lease is approximately million annually  including operating expenses associated with the leased property 
we estimate our minimum future obligation under the lease at approximately million over the remaining lease term 
we lease our other facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through fiscal and contain various provisions for rental adjustments  including  in certain cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
although we have entered into non cancelable subleases with anticipated rental income totaling  and extending to various dates through fiscal  we have not reduced the amount of our contractual obligations under the related operating leases to take into account the anticipated rental income 

table of contents purchase obligations are comprised of commitments to purchase design tools and software for use in product development  which will be spent between fiscal and fiscal we have not included open purchase orders for inventory or other expenses issued in the normal course of business in the purchase obligations shown above 
capital leases consist of equipment purchased under capital lease with payments due through june in addition to the obligations included in the table above  we have a  liability related to post retirement benefits for employees at two of our international locations 
the timing of the related payments is not known 
off balance sheet arrangements we have made guarantees and indemnities  under which we may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party  in relation to certain transactions 
in connection with the distribution to conexant stockholders of all outstanding shares of common stock of mindspeed  we generally assumed responsibility for all contingent liabilities and then current and future litigation against conexant or its subsidiaries related to our business

the duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies  and in many cases is indefinite 
the majority of our guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
as of october   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
at october   our debt consisted of long term convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
consequently  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to any significant interest rate risk relating to our convertible senior notes 
the fair value of the debt could increase or decrease if interest rates decreases or increase  respectively  and that could impact our ability and cost to negotiate a settlement of such notes prior to maturity 
in addition  we have a long term revolving credit facility 
advances under our credit facility bear interest at a variable rate ranging from prime plus to a maximum rate of prime plus  as determined in accordance with the interest rate grid set forth in the loan and security agreement 
if the prime rate increases  thereby increasing our effective borrowing rate by the same amount  cash interest expense related to the credit facility would increase dependent on any outstanding borrowings 
because there were no outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of october   any change in the prime interest rate would have no effect on our obligations under the credit facility 
foreign exchange risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and we face foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
currently  our foreign exchange risks are not hedged  however  from time to time  we may utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
these hedging transactions are intended to offset the gains and losses we experience on foreign currency transactions with gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate our overall risk of foreign exchange gains and losses 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at october   we held no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at october   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
