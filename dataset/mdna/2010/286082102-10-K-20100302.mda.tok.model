overview key financial results for were as follows our consolidated revenues decreased by approximately  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  consisting of decreased fiery revenues of million  inkjet revenues of million  and apps revenues of million 
the fiery revenue decrease of was primarily due to reduced demand from our oem customers throughout the world due to a slow global economy as well as customers reducing their inventory levels 
the inkjet revenue decrease of was primarily due to the tightened credit markets and a slow global economy 
the apps revenue decrease of was not as significant on a percentage basis due to the benefits realized from the pace acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of gross profit percentages decreased to of revenues in  as compared with of revenues in  resulting primarily from relatively fixed inkjet manufacturing costs spread over lower revenue and  to a lesser extent  costs associated with the consolidation of our ink production into a single facility to streamline the production process and reduce ink production costs 
inkjet fixed manufacturing costs have decreased as compared with the prior year  but not by enough to offset the revenue decline 
operating expenses as a percent of revenues decreased from in to in primarily due to impairment charges recorded on goodwill and certain long lived assets as a result of the impairment analysis conducted during the fourth quarter of and in process research development charges related to our acquisitions of pace and raster 
interest and other income decreased from of revenue in to of revenue in  primarily driven by lower interest income on our investments as a result of lower investment balances and interest rates 
we sold a substantial portion of our investment portfolio during the first five months of to generate cash for the redemption of our convertible senior debentures  which occurred on june  during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of the foster city  california campus for million 
under the agreement  we sold the approximately  square foot building at velocity way  as well as approximately acres of related land and certain other assets related to the property 
the cost of the land  building  improvements  and direct transaction costs were included in the determination of the million gain on sale of building and land 
in  we recorded a tax provision of million on a pre tax operating income of million  compared to a tax benefit of million recorded in on pre tax operating loss of million 
the change from to primarily related to the charge related to the sale of building and land in compared with the non deductible impact of the goodwill impairment charge in

the first segment  fiery  includes products  services  and technology  which connect digital copiers with computer networks  and is made up of stand alone and embedded controllers  bundled solutions  and design licensed solutions primarily for the office market and commercial printing 
this segment includes our fiery series external print servers and embedded servers  splash and micropress  color and black white server products  software options for fiery products  and parts 
the fiery segment also includes server related revenue comprised of scanning solutions 
the second segment  inkjet  consists of sales of super wide and wide format inkjet printers  industrial inkjet printers  ink  parts  and service revenues from the vutek  jetrion  and rastek businesses 
the third segment  apps  consists of software technology focused on printing workflow  pmis  proofing  e commerce  and job tracking tools 
our revenues by operating segment for the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands years ended december  change revenue over over fiery inkjet apps total revenue 
table of contents revenues in the fiery and apps operating segments for the twelve months ended december  have been revised to reflect the reclassification of fiery related software revenue from the apps operating segment to the fiery operating segment 
total revenues for the twelve months ended december  have not changed 
overview revenue was   and million in   and  respectively  resulting in a decrease in compared with and a decrease in compared with the million decrease in compared with consisted of decreased fiery revenues of million  inkjet revenues of million  and apps revenues of million 
the million decrease in compared to consisted of decreased fiery revenues of million and inkjet revenues of million  offset by increased apps revenues of million 
fiery revenues fiery revenues declined by million  or  in compared with  which was primarily driven by reduced demand from our oem customers due to a weak global economy in  as well as customers reducing their inventory levels 
the tightening global credit markets also contributed to the revenue decline as it has remained relatively more difficult for some of our customers to obtain financing 
fiery revenues declined by million  or  in versus  which was primarily driven by reduced demand from our oem customers throughout the world due to the slowing global economy 
the tightening of global credit markets also contributed to the decline as it had become relatively more difficult for some of our customers to obtain financing 
inkjet revenues inkjet revenues declined by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to global credit markets remaining tight as it has remained relatively more difficult for some of our customers to obtain financing 
the impact of the slow global economy and tight credit markets were partially offset by several new inkjet product introductions 
inkjet revenues declined by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to lower printer volumes in the fourth quarter of it had become relatively more difficult for customers to obtain financing to purchase our products due to the tightening of global credit markets 
in addition  the softening of the retail sector and related demand for signs  billboards  and point of purchase displays impacted our customers businesses and their demand for ink  which resulted in a lower demand for our ink products in the fourth quarter of apps revenues apps revenues declined by million  or in compared with  which was not as significant on a percentage basis compared with our other operating segments due to the benefits realized from the pace acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of  and the recurring nature of a portion of apps revenues 
apps recurring revenues include subscription revenue and maintenance fees 
apps revenues increased by million  or  in compared with  through new customers and the acquisition of pace during the third quarter of  which strengthened our pmis products 
the apps operating segment includes our management systems software  including monarch formerly hagen  pace  psi  logic  printsmith and printflow  our web based order entry and order management software  and our 
table of contents color proofing software 
in  we reorganized our pmis product lines after the acquisition of pace to better leverage our investment in this segment and concentrate our resources on fewer products 
as a result  we are no longer selling psi and logic to new customers and have reduced our investment in the development of these products 
we currently sell printsmith to small print for pay and small commercial print shops  pace to medium and large commercial print shops  and monarch to large commercial  publication  and digital print shops 
our revenues by geographic area for the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change revenue over over americas emea japan other international locations total revenue revenues declined in across all regions 
in the individual regions  fiery and inkjet declined in the americas and emea  while fiery declined in japan 
americas revenues increased from of total revenues in to of total revenues in and emea revenues decreased from of total revenues in to of total revenues in  as a result of stronger sales in the americas  as compared with emea  in as compared with in  revenues in the americas  emea  japan  and other international locations represented    and of revenues  respectively  with no change from revenues declined in across all regions primarily driven by fiery 
in the individual regions  fiery revenues represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan and other international locations  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
inkjet revenues represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and other international locations  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
americas revenues decreased by in compared to  primarily due to weakness in fiery sales caused by reduced demand from our oem customers due to the slow economy and weak inkjet sales due to the tight global credit markets and the decline in global marketing spending 
likewise  the soft retail sector and the related demand impacted our customers businesses 
emea revenues decreased also due to the slow economy and tight credit markets in europe 
japan revenues decreased as a result of reduced fiery demand 
other international location revenues decreased by mainly driven by lower sales due to the impact of macro economic conditions 
new fiery and inkjet product launches are beginning to mitigate the impact of the economic environment 
shipments to some of our oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn ship to other locations  making it more difficult to obtain accurate geographical shipment data 
accordingly  we believe that export sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported 
we expect that sales outside of the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
a substantial portion of our revenue over the years has been attributable to sales through our oem customers and independent distributor channels 
canon and xerox each contributed over of our revenues individually and together accounted for approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december  
table of contents   and  respectively 
we have shown decreasing dependency on our oem customers 
in   and    and  respectively  of revenues were from non oem sources 
over time  we expect the oem percentages to continue to decline 
because sales of our printer and copier related products constitute a significant portion of our revenues and there is a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of oem customers for a significant portion of our controller revenues in future periods 
our decreasing revenue reliance on our major oem partners is attributable to the increase in the inkjet operating segment where most revenue is generated from sales to distributors and direct customers 
no assurance can be given that our relationships with these and other significant oem customers will continue or that we will be successful in increasing the number of our oem customers or the size of our existing oem relationships 
several of our oem customers have reduced their purchases from us at various times in the past and any customer could do so in the future as there are no contractual obligations with most of our oems to purchase our products at all  or in significant amounts 
such reductions have occurred in the past and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we expect that if we increase our revenues from inkjet and apps products  the percentage of our revenue that comes from individual oems will decrease 
we intend to continue to develop new products and technologies for each of our product lines including new generations of server and controller products  super wide and wide format printers  and other new product lines  and to distribute those new products to or through current and new oem customers  distribution partners  and end users in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of current or future products will be successful 
if sales of our products do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if we are not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that any products that we introduce in the future will successfully compete  be accepted by the market  or otherwise effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from our older products 
market acceptance of our software products  products acquired through acquisitions  and other products cannot be assured 
in addition  we may experience potential loss of sales  unexpected costs  or adverse impact on relationships with customers or suppliers as a result of acquisitions 
we also believe that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for our products will affect revenues in the future 
we have previously reduced  and in the future will likely change  prices for our products 
depending on the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  price changes have had  and may in the future have  an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
gross profit gross profits by operating segment  excluding stock based compensation  for the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands year ended december  fiery inkjet apps stock based compensation expense total revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross profit percentages 
table of contents year ended december  fiery inkjet apps stock based compensation expense total revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross profit percentages year ended december  fiery inkjet apps stock based compensation expense total revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross profit percentages our gross profit percentages were   and for the years ended  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit percentages in  as compared with  was primarily due to reduced inkjet gross profit percentages from in to in  which resulted from relatively fixed manufacturing costs spread over lower revenue and  to a lesser extent  costs associated with the consolidation of our ink production into a single facility to streamline the production process and reduce ink production costs 
inkjet fixed manufacturing costs have decreased as compared with the prior year  but not by enough to offset the revenue decline 
inkjet revenues were   and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
our inkjet operating segment is growing as a percentage of revenue  which decreases the gross profit percentage 
inkjet gross profit percentages are lower than fiery gross profit percentages 
our ink sales represent a continuing revenue stream to existing customers that will increase if our inkjet customers production increases 
ink margins are typically higher than overall inkjet margins 
the decrease in fiery gross profit percentages from in to in was primarily mix related as embedded servers have lower margins than stand alone servers  along with costs to launch new products 
fiery revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in the increase in apps gross profit percentages from in to in was primarily due to operating efficiencies  which continue to be achieved through the pace acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of our overall gross profit percentages were also aided by increased apps revenues as a percentage of total revenues from in to in the decrease in gross profit percentages in of  as compared with in  was primarily due to an increased percentage of lower margin inkjet revenues and lower inkjet fixed manufacturing costs spread over relatively fixed inkjet revenues 
inkjet fixed manufacturing costs decreased as compared with the prior year  but not by enough to offset the revenue decline 
if our product mix changes significantly  our gross profits will fluctuate 
in addition  gross profits can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include market prices achieved on our current and future products  availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors  and print heads  subcontractor manufacturing costs  product mix  channel  geographic mix  product transition results  new product 
table of contents introductions  competition  and general economic conditions in the us and abroad 
consequently  gross profits may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  if we reduce prices  gross profits for our products could be lower 
many of our products and sub assemblies are manufactured by subcontract manufacturers that purchase most of the necessary components 
if our subcontract manufacturers cannot obtain necessary components at favorable prices  we could experience increased product costs 
we purchase certain components directly  including processors  memory  certain asics  and software licensed from various sources  including adobe postscript software 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses were   and million respectively for the years ended december    and the decrease in stock based compensation expense of million  or  from to and the increase in stock based compensation expense of million  or  from to was primarily because no equity awards were issued during the first months of as a result of the stock option review conducted at that time 
as explained below  amortization of stock based compensation expense under the graded vesting method results in more significant expense in the initial years of vesting 
we account for stock based payment awards  in accordance with asc  stock compensation  which requires stock based compensation expense to be recognized based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant 
we amortize compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period 
stock based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
this has the impact of greater stock based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more discussion of stock based compensation 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for the years ended december    and in thousands years ended december  change over over research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of identified intangibles in process research development restructuring and other goodwill and asset impairment total operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million in  as compared with  and increased by million in  as compared with operating expenses as a percent of revenues decreased from in to in primarily due to impairment charges recorded on goodwill and certain long lived assets as a result of the impairment analysis conducted during the fourth quarter of and in process research development charges related to our acquisitions of pace and rastek

research and development expenses were million in  or of revenue  million in  or of revenue  and million in  or of revenue 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared with personnel related expenses decreased by million primarily due to head count  salary  variable compensation  consulting  and travel reductions 
prototypes and non recurring engineering expenses decreased by million 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million due to the timing of equity awards issued during the last twelve months amortized under the graded vesting method 
the remaining million reduction in research and development expenses relates to facility downsizing achieved during the last year in the apps operating segment and cost reductions achieved by focused efforts on key initiatives in all areas 
the slight decrease in research and development expenses of million in  as compared with  was primarily due to a million decrease in personnel related expenses  including consulting  and a million decrease in prototypes and non recurring engineering expenses  offset by a million increase in depreciation of fixed assets resulting from r d equipment acquired during the year  a million increase in facilities expenses  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
research and development head count was   and as of december    and  respectively 
cost reductions achieved during the year ended december  compared with the corresponding prior periods are net of increased research and development spending due to the pace and raster acquisitions  which closed during the latter half of we expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against other currencies  research and development expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel expenses  costs of trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment  depreciation  and costs associated with sales offices in the us  europe  asia  and other locations around the world

sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared with personnel related expenses decreased by million primarily due to head count  salary  and variable compensation reductions 
travel expenses decreased by million due to reduced travel to trade shows in the current year 
marketing and trade show expenses decreased by million due to more efficient spending and the inclusion of drupa trade show expenses during the second quarter of drupa is a european trade show that is held once every four years 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million due to the timing of equity awards issued during the last twelve months amortized under the graded vesting method 
the remaining million reduction in sales and marketing expenses relates to facility downsizing achieved during the last year and a focused effort on cost reduction in all areas 
the million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in  as compared with  was primarily related to a million decrease in marketing and travel related expenses  offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense

expenses associated with the stock option review decreased by million as the review was concluded in legal expenses decreased by million due to the settlement of certain cases and more efficient spending 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million due to the timing of equity awards issued during the last twelve months amortized under the graded vesting method 
these decreases were partially offset by a million legal reserve reduction  net of settlements 
the remaining million reduction in general and administrative expenses is due to focused effort on cost reduction in all areas 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in  as compared with  was primarily related to a decrease of million in legal and accounting expenses related to the stock option review completed in and us internal revenue code section a tax payments made to the us government on behalf of employees  a decrease of acquisition costs of million  and a million legal reserve reversal  net of settlements  offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense

restructuring and other charges include severance costs of   and million related to head count reductions of   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
severance costs include severance payments  related employee benefits  retention bonuses  and outplacement or relocation costs 
restructuring and other charges includes charges to downsize three facilities during and charges to downsize five facilities and integrate our pace and raster acquisitions and related employees during throughout and during each of the first three quarters of  we announced restructuring plans to better align our costs with revenue levels due to the current economic environment 
these reductions are one of many cost reduction actions that we have taken to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate 
amortization of identified intangibles amortization of identified intangibles for the years ended december    and totaled million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  respectively 

table of contents the decrease of million in  as compared with  is due to several intangible assets becoming fully amortized in  partially offset by a full year of amortization of intangible assets identified as components of the pace and raster acquisitions  which closed during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and accelerated useful lives of certain trademarks primarily within the inkjet operating segment

interest income for the years ended december    and was   and million  respectively 
the decrease of million from to and million from to was driven by lower interest income on our investments as a result of lower investment balances and interest rates as we sold a substantial portion of our investment portfolio during the first five months of to generate cash for the redemption of our convertible senior debentures  which occurred on june  we had net realized gains on our marketable securities of million in  net realized gains of million in  and net realized losses of million in interest expense consists of interest and debt amortization costs related to our convertible senior debentures 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million from to was driven by the redemption of the outstanding balance of our convertible senior debentures on june   which totaled million 
the remaining fluctuation in expense between   and was primarily due to realized and unrealized foreign exchanges gains and losses 
gain on sale of building and land during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of the foster city  california campus for million 
under the agreement  we sold the approximately  square foot building at velocity way  as well as approximately acres of related land and certain other assets related to the property 
the cost of the land  building  improvements  and direct transaction costs were included in the determination of the million gain on sale of building and land 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from september to december of each year 
this change is being made to better align impairment testing procedures with year end financial reporting and the annual business planning and budgeting process  which commences during the fourth quarter of each year 
as a result  the goodwill impairment testing will reflect the result of input from business and other operating personnel in the development of the budget 
accordingly  management considers this accounting change preferable 
this change does not accelerate  delay  avoid  or cause an impairment charge  nor does this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements 
the annual goodwill impairment testing was initially completed as of september   in accordance with our previously established annual testing timeline 
as a result of this accounting change  we also completed the impairment testing procedures as of december  
table of contents a two step impairment test of goodwill is required pursuant to asc in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded that is equal to the difference 
based on our valuation results  we had determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
therefore  management determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as of september  based on the outcome of the conditions existing during the fourth quarter of  we determined there was a triggering event that required an interim impairment analysis had occurred relating to the inkjet reporting unit 
the resulting impairment analysis resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of the goodwill valuation analysis was performed based on our respective reporting units fiery  inkjet  and apps which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of the inkjet reporting unit as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
the fair value of the fiery and apps reporting units were determined based on the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we measured fair value of the inkjet reporting unit based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying values 
fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceeds carrying value by   and  respectively 
to identify suitable comparable companies under the market approach  consideration was given to the financial condition and operating performance of the reporting unit being evaluated relative to companies operating in the same or similar businesses  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
consideration was given to the investment characteristics of the subject company relative to those of similar publicly traded companies ie  guideline companies 
guideline company stocks are actively traded 
two applications of the market approach are the public company market multiple method pcmmm and the similar transaction method stm 
in applying the pcmmm  valuation multiples were derived from historical and projected operating data of guideline companies and applied to the appropriate operating data of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
four suitable guideline companies were identified for the inkjet reporting unit 
suitable guideline companies could not be identified for the fiery and apps reporting units 
consequently  the stm was employed based on actual majority acquisition transactions in the fiery and apps respective reporting unit s industry to arrive at an indication of the fair value of these reporting units 
because the fair value of the fiery and apps reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values as of december  as indicated by the internal market based analysis  management did not deem it necessary to further supplement the bases for this judgment 
while the fair value of the inkjet reporting unit exceeded its carrying value based on our internal market based valuation  management determined to further examine whether an impairment had occurred given the recent inkjet impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of we reviewed the factors that could trigger an impairment charge and completed an income based impairment analysis  consistent with the approach taken during the third quarter of 
table of contents we engaged a third party valuation firm to aid management in its analysis during the third quarter of all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm at that time  the impairment analysis and related valuations represented the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
we did not engage a third party to aid management in the current quarter analysis 
solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the income approach to assess the fair value of the inkjet reporting unit  we made the following assumptions a difficult economic climate will continue through with inkjet results generally below results  substantially mitigated by new product introductions  which occurred in and will continue in allowing inkjet results to improve  followed by a recovery period between and  and long term industry growth past our discounted cash flow projections for the inkjet reporting unit were based on five year financial forecasts  which were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the independent valuation firm engaged by us during the preceding quarter 
the significant assumptions utilized in these five year forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to for the inkjet reporting unit  which equates to a compound annual growth rate of 
future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units include the determination of appropriate market comparables  estimated multiples of revenue and ebitda that a willing buyer is likely to pay  estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay  and gross profits 
inkjet gross profits are expected to increase as fixed production costs are absorbed by increased inkjet volumes 
to assess the reasonableness of the estimated control premium of  we examined the most similar transactions in relevant industries and determined the average premium indicated by the transactions deemed to be most similar to a hypothetical transaction involving our reporting units 
we examined the weighted average and median control premiums offered in these industries  industry specific control premiums  and specific transaction control premiums to conclude that our estimated control premium is reasonable 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and our assessment of growth and profitability in each reporting unit over the coming years 
given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit 
table of contents rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes a interim triggering event 
it is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
a change in the revenue growth factor impacts fiery and apps fair values by and  respectively  under the market approach 
because inkjet fair value is determined using a weighting of the market and income approaches  the impact of changes in the revenue growth factor of result in either an increase in inkjet fair value of or a decrease in inkjet fair value of 
likewise  the impact of changes in the discount rate of result in either an increase in inkjet fair value of or a decrease in inkjet fair value of 
consequently  we have concluded that no reasonably possible charges would reduce the fair value of the reporting units to such a level that it would cause a failure in step one 
long lived asset impairment other investments  included within other assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets  and services that are strategic to us 
investments in which we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not have a majority voting interest  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the process of assessing whether a particular equity investment s fair value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment due to the lack of a mature and stable public market for these securities 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider the investee s most recent financial results  cash position  recent cash flow data  projected cash flows both short and long term  financing needs  recent financing rounds  most recent valuation data  the current investing environment  management or ownership changes  and competition 
this process is based primarily on information that we request and receive from these privately held companies and is performed on a quarterly basis 
although we evaluate all of our privately held equity investments for impairment based on this criteria  each investment s fair value is only estimated when events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may have a significant effect on its fair value because the fair value of each investment is not readily determinable 
where these factors indicate that the equity investment s fair value is less than its carrying cost  and where we consider such diminution in value to be other than temporary  we record an impairment charge to reduce such equity investment to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we assessed each remaining investment s technology pipeline and market conditions in the industry for the next several years and determined that it is no longer probable that they will generate enough positive future cash flows to recover the full carrying amount of the investment 
as such  we recognized an impairment charge of million

effective january   we adopted asc through  income taxes basic recognition threshold 
asc through clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by requiring a tax position be recognized only when it is more likely than not that the tax position  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority 
the tax benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the cumulative effect of adopting asc through was recorded as an increase of million to retained earnings  and a decrease of million and million in goodwill and taxes payable  respectively 
in  the internal revenue service irs completed their examination of the through tax years 
as a result of the irs audit settlement  we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by million  of which million was recorded as a discrete tax benefit 
in conjunction with the irs audit settlement  we also reduced deferred tax assets and equity by million and million  respectively  and expect to pay approximately million to federal and state tax authorities as a result of the closure of the audit 
these adjustments are primarily related to intercompany cost allocations and the research and development credits 
unaudited non gaap financial information to supplement our gaap consolidated financial results  we use non gaap measures of net income and earnings per diluted share  which are gaap net income and gaap earnings per diluted share adjusted to exclude certain recurring and non recurring costs  expenses  and gains 
we believe that the presentation of non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding non cash expenses and significant recurring and non recurring items that we believe are important to understand our financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met specified targets and thresholds 
management uses non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes that the exclusion of the items described below  for which the amounts and or timing may vary significantly depending upon our activities and other factors  facilitates comparability of our operating performance from period to period 
we have chosen to provide this information to investors so they can analyze our operating results in the same way that management does and use this information in their assessment of our business and valuation 
we compute non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share by adjusting gaap net income and gaap earnings per diluted share to remove the impact of recurring amortization of acquisition related intangibles  recurring stock based compensation expense  as well as restructuring related and non recurring charges and gains and the tax effect of these adjustments 
such non recurring charges and gains include project abandonment costs  goodwill and asset impairment charges  costs related to our stock option review completed in  certain legal settlements  and our sale of certain real estate assets 
examples of these excluded items are described below amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
identified intangible assets acquired to date are being amortized on a straight line basis over one to twenty years 
stock based compensation expense is recognized in accordance with asc  stock compensation 

table of contents restructuring related charges 
we have incurred restructuring  severance  and facility closure charges as we reduce the number and size of our facilities and the size of our workforce 
non recurring charges and gains  including asset impairment consists of costs related to equipment and non cancellable purchase orders incurred relating to a planned product that was cancelled 
on january   we sold a portion of the foster city  california campus for a final amount of million to gilead sciences  inc  resulting in a gain on sale of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
tax effect of these adjustments 
after removing the non gaap items  we apply the principles of asc  income taxes  to estimate the non gaap income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap and may be materially different from other non gaap measures  including similarly titled non gaap measures  used by other companies 
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from  as a substitute for  or superior to  net income or earnings per diluted share prepared in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact on our reported financial results 
we expect to continue to incur expenses of a nature similar to the non gaap adjustments described above  and exclusion of these items from our non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual  infrequent  or non recurring

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition  and contingencies on an ongoing basis 
the estimates are based on historical and current experience  the impact of the current economic environment  and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty reserves  and litigation accruals  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  valuation analyses for intangible assets and goodwill  business combinations  and determination of functional currencies for consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions  including upgrades  inkjet printers  including components replaced under maintenance agreements  and ink  software licensing and development  and royalties 
we also receive service revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support  training  and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab and when applicable  asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for the sale of controllers  printers  and ink 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
products generally must be shipped against written purchase orders 
we use either a binding purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales to some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with a binding purchase order 
sales to our resellers are also evidenced by binding purchase orders or signed contracts and do not generally contain rights of return or price protection 
our arrangements generally do not include product acceptance clauses 
when acceptance is required  revenue is recognized when the product is accepted by the customer 
delivery for hardware generally is complete when title and risk of loss is transferred at point of shipment from manufacturing facilities  or when the product is delivered to the customer s local common carrier 
we also sell products and services using sales arrangements with terms resulting in different timing for revenue recognition as follows if the title and or risk of loss is transferred at a location other than our manufacturing facility  revenue is recognized when title and or risk of loss transfers to the customer  per the terms of the agreement  if title is retained until payment is received  revenue is recognized when title is passed upon receipt of payment  
table of contents if payment is contingent upon installation  the revenue related to the portion of the payment tied to installation is deferred until installation is complete  or if the sales arrangement is classified as an operating lease  revenue is recognized ratably over the lease term 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we may not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support  and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of asc  software revenue recognition  and if applicable  sab and asc to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support  and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with asc revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and to the software license portion of the agreements using the residual method 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of our professional services based on the rates charged to our customers in stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe of fair value for post contract customer support based on substantive renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognized when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we also have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize revenue from the subscriptions ratably over the service period 
allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty reserves  and litigation accruals 
to evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  management must estimate the collectability of accounts receivables 
to do so  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million  as of december  similarly  management must estimate potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to evaluate the need for inventory reserves 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and the acceptance of our products to evaluate the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances and reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our net income loss for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventory balance was million  net of inventory reserves of million  as of december  management must estimate potential inventory return rates and replacement or repair costs to evaluate the need for warranty reserves 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing warranty reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period  if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
warranty reserves were million as of december  
table of contents we accrue for estimated litigation costs  including potential regulatory fines  when likelihood of incurrence of the related cost is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs 
until both of these conditions are met  the related litigation costs are recorded as incurred 
the material assumptions we use to estimate the required litigation accrual include communication with our external attorneys regarding the expected duration of the lawsuit  the potential outcome of the lawsuit  and the likelihood of settlement  our strategy regarding the lawsuit  deductible amounts under our insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 
the outcome of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted and our income could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively  if the outcome is different than expected 
we have from time to time established allowances or accruals for uncertainties related to revenues and for potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
management bases its estimates for the allowances or accruals based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc we must use our judgment in determining and applying the assumptions needed for the valuation of stock options  issuances of common stock under our espp  restricted stock units  and restricted stock awards 
we are required to apply a forfeiture rate to reflect what we believe will be our final expense related to stock based compensation 
the amounts to be recorded as stock based compensation expense in the future are subject to change if our assumptions for the variables used in determining the fair value of the instruments and the forfeiture rates are revised 
in adopting asc  we elected to adopt the simplified method to establish our beginning balance for the additional paid in capital apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation 
tax shortfalls resulting from the tax effects of employee stock based compensation absorbed the remaining balance of the apic pool in accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax expense and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have maintained a valuation allowance of million as of december  for foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best and compensation deductions potentially limited by us internal revenue code m 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
significant management judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
our gross unrecognized benefits total million as of december  our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on 
table of contents factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
if actual settlements differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to recognize a tax benefit or additional tax charge that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   we have permanently reinvested million of unremitted earnings 
should these earnings be remitted to the us  the tax on these earnings would be million 
valuation analyses of intangible assets and goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from september to december of each year 
this change is being made to better align impairment testing procedures with year end financial reporting and the annual business planning and budgeting process  which commences during the fourth quarter of each year 
as a result  the goodwill impairment testing will reflect the result of input from business and other operating personnel in the development of the budget 
accordingly  management considers this accounting change preferable 
this change does not accelerate  delay  avoid  or cause an impairment charge  nor does this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements 
the annual goodwill impairment testing was initially completed as of september   in accordance with our previously established annual testing timeline 
as a result of this accounting change  we also completed the impairment testing as of december  a two step impairment test of goodwill is required pursuant to asc in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded that is equal to the difference 
based on our valuation results  we had determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
therefore  management determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as of september  based on the outcome of the conditions existing during the fourth quarter of  we determined there was a triggering event that required an interim impairment analysis had occurred relating to the inkjet reporting unit 
the resulting impairment analysis resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of the goodwill valuation analysis was performed based on our respective reporting units fiery  inkjet  and apps which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of the inkjet reporting unit as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
the fair value of the fiery and apps reporting units were determined based on the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we measured fair value of the inkjet reporting unit based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying values 
fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceeds carrying value by   and  respectively 
to identify suitable comparable companies under the market approach  consideration was given to the financial condition and operating performance of the reporting unit being evaluated relative to companies operating in the same or similar businesses  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors 
table of contents and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
consideration was given to the investment characteristics of the subject company relative to those of similar publicly traded companies ie  guideline companies 
guideline company stocks are actively traded 
two applications of the market approach are the public company market multiple method pcmmm and the similar transaction method stm 
in applying the pcmmm  valuation multiples were derived from historical and projected operating data of guideline companies and applied to the appropriate operating data of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
four suitable guideline companies were identified for the inkjet reporting unit 
suitable guideline companies could not be identified for the fiery and apps reporting units 
consequently  the stm was employed based on actual majority acquisition transactions in the fiery and apps respective reporting unit s industry to arrive at an indication of the fair value of these reporting units 
because the fair value of the fiery and apps reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values as of december  as indicated by the internal market based analysis  management did not deem it necessary to further supplement the bases for this judgment 
while the fair value of the inkjet reporting unit exceeded its carrying value based on our internal market based valuation  management determined to further examine whether an impairment had occurred given the recent inkjet impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of we reviewed the factors that could trigger an impairment charge and completed an income based impairment analysis  consistent with the approach taken during the third quarter of we engaged a third party valuation firm to aid management in its analysis during the third quarter of all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm at that time  the impairment analysis and related valuations represented the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
we did not engage a third party to aid management in the current quarter analysis 
solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the income approach to assess the fair value of the inkjet reporting unit  we made the following assumptions a difficult economic climate will continue through with inkjet results generally below results  substantially mitigated by new product introductions  which occurred in and will continue in  allowing inkjet results to improve  followed by a recovery period between and  and long term industry growth past our discounted cash flow projections for the inkjet reporting unit were based on five year financial forecasts  which were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the independent valuation firm engaged by us during the preceding quarter 
the significant assumptions utilized in these five year forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to for the inkjet reporting unit  which equates to a compound annual growth rate of 
future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units include the determination of appropriate market comparables  estimated multiples of revenue and ebitda that a willing buyer is likely to pay  estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay  and gross profits 
inkjet gross profits are expected to increase as fixed production costs are absorbed by increased inkjet volumes 
to assess the reasonableness of the estimated control premium of  we examined the most similar transactions in relevant industries and determined the average premium indicated by the transactions deemed to 
table of contents be most similar to a hypothetical transaction involving our reporting units 
we examined the weighted average and median control premiums offered in these industries  industry specific control premiums  and specific transaction control premiums to conclude that our estimated control premium is reasonable 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and our assessment of growth and profitability in each reporting unit over the coming years 
given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes a interim triggering event 
it is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research development  based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management estimates fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop in process research development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or other actual results 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs of vacating duplicate facilities  including the future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
these costs are based on estimates made by management and are subject to refinement 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
on july   we acquired pace for approximately million in cash  plus an additional future cash earn out  which is contingent on achieving certain performance targets 
as of december   approximately million had been earned 
we acquired pace to further strengthen our apps reporting unit 
on december   
table of contents we acquired rastek  a mid market  wide format graphics printer developer and manufacturer for approximately million  to further expand our inkjet reporting unit 
the pace and rastek acquisitions are discussed more fully in note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we apply the provisions of asc  business combinations  when accounting for acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research development based on their estimated fair values 
all acquisitions are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
in december  asc was issued  which retained the fundamental requirement that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations while revising the accounting treatment for the fair values of certain acquired assets  liabilities  and expenses 
see note the company and its significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of this recent accounting pronouncement and its impact on our accounting for business combinations 
the amendments to asc apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries  which together account for approximately of our net revenues  approximately of our total assets and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  we typically quote and bill our international customers in us dollars 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed below  we consider the us dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our german subsidiary  efi gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency and our japanese subsidiary  electronics for imaging japan kk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must translate the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they maintain their accounting records  which is generally the local currency  into us dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  when the transactions are not denominated in the functional currency  are included within the statement of operations or  if the transactions are denominated in the functional currency  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income

we calculate dso by dividing net accounts receivable at the end of the quarter by revenue recognized during the quarter  multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
the slight decrease in dsos is due to effective collections during the year and a mix shift to fiery product lines  which typically have shorter payment terms 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in the mix of business between our direct and oem customers  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
as the percentage of inkjet and apps related revenue increases  we expect dsos may trend higher 
our dsos related to software and direct sales are traditionally higher than those related to oem customers as  historically  oems have paid on a more timely basis 

table of contents inventories our inventories are procured primarily in support of the inkjet and fiery product categories 
our inventories of million were comparable with the prior year 
finished goods increased by million  while raw materials decreased by a corresponding amount 
this increase consisted primarily of finished goods driven by uv ink  the rastek acquisition  new product introductions  and inventories required for new product introductions in future periods 
we plan to carry increased uv ink inventories as revenues continue to increase as a result of the ongoing transition from solvent to uv ink 
accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and income taxes payable our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities 
the change in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and income taxes payable decreased our cash flows by approximately million in and million in  and increased our cash flows by million in our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was and million at december  and  respectively 
investing activities a summary of our investing activities at december    and is as follows in thousands purchases of short term investments proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments reclassification of funds from cash cash equivalents to short term investments purchases  net of proceeds from sales  of property and equipment proceeds from sale of building and land  net of direct transaction costs businesses acquired  net of cash acquired purchases of other investments net cash provided by used for investing activities acquisitions raster printers  inc raster on december   we acquired the remaining interest of raster for approximately million in cash  including direct acquisition costs plus an additional cash earn out  which is contingent upon achieving certain performance targets 
the maximum additional earn out is million 
the first earn out period ended december  with no additional consideration earned 
headquartered in san jose  california  raster sells uv wide format printers primarily to mid range customers in the display graphics market 
pace systems group  inc pace on july   we purchased pace for approximately million in cash  including direct acquisition costs  plus an additional cash earn out amount  which is contingent upon achieving certain performance targets 
the maximum additional earn out is million 
the first earn out period ended december  with additional consideration earned of approximately million  which has been accounted for as an adjustment to the purchase price 
headquartered in jacksonville  florida  pace is a print management software company that provides pmis and e commerce software solutions 

table of contents property and equipment our net property and equipment purchases totaled   and million in   and  respectively 
our property and equipment additions have been funded by cash from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business  our business outlook  and decisions to further invest or expand business sites 
on january   we completed the sale of building and land to gilead for million 
all conditions precedent to the receipt of the funds held in escrow were met during the second quarter of  which resulted in an adjustment to the purchase price of million 
net proceeds from the sale of building and land  net of direct transaction costs paid in  were million 
the property sold included approximately thirty acres of land and the office building located on the land at velocity way  foster city  california  consisting of approximately  square feet and certain other assets related to the property 
investments during  we purchased  net of sales and maturities  marketable securities of million 
during  we received net proceeds from the sale and maturities of our marketable securities of million  of which million was used to repay the convertible senior debenture holders 
during  we received net proceeds from the sale and maturities of our marketable securities of million 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale 
our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we may hold investments in corporate bonds and us government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive  or we have better uses for the cash 
because we invest primarily in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted investments we have restricted investments that are required to be maintained by the synthetic lease of our foster city office 
we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts  which fully collateralize our synthetic leases 
we had and million of restricted investments at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  million was accounted for as a non current asset as restricted investments 
at december   the remaining million was accounted for as a current asset within assets held for sale related to the sale of a portion of our foster city offices and accompanying real estate to gilead 
for further information on these transactions  see the discussion at off balance sheet financing herein and note sale of building and land of the notes to consolidated financial statements as of december  financing activities the primary use of funds for financing activities in   and  was the use of   and million  respectively  of cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock  which included our million accelerated share repurchase asr and our million modified dutch auction tender offer in  repurchase of stock options from certain employees in conjunction with our fair value stock option exchange  and the net settlement of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards for employee common stock related tax liabilities 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our programs to repurchase our common stock 

table of contents historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and for espp shares 
we received cash proceeds from the issuance of espp shares of in and we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchase of espp shares of and million in and  respectively 
while we may continue to receive proceeds from these plans in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans  and general market conditions 
we anticipate that cash provided from the exercise of stock options may decline over time as we shift to issuance of restricted stock awards and units rather than stock option awards 
the synthetic lease agreements for our corporate headquarters at december  provide for residual value guarantees 
under asc  guarantees  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantees have no material value as of december  and therefore have not recorded any liability 
on june   we exercised our option to redeem and paid in cash the outstanding balance of our convertible senior debentures  which totaled million 
the redemption price for the securities was of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest amounts to  but not including  the redemption date 
other commitments our inventory for our fiery line of products consists primarily of raw and finished goods  memory subsystems  processors  and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
our inventories for our inkjet products consist of raw and finished goods  print heads  frames  solvent ink  and other components in support of our internal manufacturing operations and uv ink  which is purchased from third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our uv ink 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing of controllers or ink  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics  or memory subsystems to our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially property and equipment would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventories we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supplies were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the related allowance 
legal proceedings from time to time  we may be involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations  and proceedings relating to contractual disputes  securities law  intellectual property  employment matters  and other claims or litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of our business 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our specific litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel  which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes  assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation 
table of contents and settlement strategies 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and ranges of possible loss on the pending litigation matters  we are unable to predict with certainty the precise liability that could finally result from a range of possible unfavorable outcomes 
however  taking all of the above factors into account  we reserve an amount that we could reasonably expect to pay for the cases discussed 
our estimates could be incorrect  and we could pay more or less than our current accrual 
litigation can be costly  diverting management s attention and could  upon resolution  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
please refer to item  legal proceedings  in this annual report on form k for more information regarding our legal proceedings 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total lease obligations related to the principal corporate facilities are estimated based on current market interest rates libor 
see off balance sheet financing 
excludes contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities and certain purchase orders as discussed below 
purchase obligations in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on when the goods or services are received or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
see note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
off balance sheet financing synthetic lease arrangements as of december  we were a party to two synthetic leases the lease and the lease  together leases covering our foster city facilities located at and velocity way  foster city  california 
these leases provided a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
the leases 
table of contents included an option to purchase the facilities during or at the end of the leases term for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities 
the funds pledged under the leases million for the lease and million for the lease at december  were in libor based interest bearing accounts and restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
on january   we sold the  square foot velocity way building  along with approximately acres of land and certain other assets related to the property to gilead for a total price of million 
we retained ownership of the approximately  square foot building at velocity way that we currently occupy along with the related land 
we exercised our purchase option with respect to the lease in connection with the sale of the building and land and terminated the corresponding synthetic lease 
accordingly  the million of pledged funds were re classified as assets held for sale under current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december  and recognized in the determination of the gain on sale of building and land in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  we have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the building equal to of their funding of the lease 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with all such financial and merger related covenants as of december  we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantee under the lease and have determined there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
in conjunction with the lease  we have entered into a separate ground lease with the lessor for approximately years 
as of december   we were treated as the owner of this building for federal income tax purposes 
since we exercised our purchase option with respect to the lease  our maximum exposure under our remaining synthetic lease arrangement is million as of december  we have applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in asc for variable interest entities vies 
we have evaluated our synthetic lease agreement to determine if the arrangement qualifies as a vie under asc we have determined that the synthetic lease agreement does qualify as a vie  however  because we are not the primary beneficiary under asc  we are not required to consolidate the vie in our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  general credit  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  liquidity  and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by the tightening of global credit markets and increase in economic uncertainty that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings and cash flows 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
during the fourth quarter of  we began hedging our operating expense exposure in indian rupees for a notional amount of million 
interest rate risk marketable securities we maintain an investment portfolio of short term investments of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these short term investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated 
table of contents other comprehensive income 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points over a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of basis points foreign currency exchange risk a large portion of our business is conducted in countries other than the us we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro  british pound  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in us dollars  we have exposures from non us dollar denominated sales primarily euro and operating expenses primarily euro and indian rupee in foreign countries 
we can benefit from a weaker dollar and we can be adversely affected from a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our consolidated operating expenses and operating loss as expressed in us dollars 
during the fourth quarter of  we began hedging our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and europe and operating expenses in europe  india  and japan 
during the fourth quarter of  we began hedging our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
as of december   we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures  but we may consider hedging against currency movements in other currencies  as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities  typically us treasury and agencies securities  corporate debt instruments  and asset backed instruments 
these short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
