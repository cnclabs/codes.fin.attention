in addition  we increased our financial services revenue by attracting new cardholders through low cost marketing efforts with our retail and direct businesses 
we added new credit cardholders as the number of average active accounts increased to over million compared to during  our financial services business executed two change of terms to lessen the effects of the provisions of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act and increasing credit card charge offs 
these changes in terms resulted in operating income for our financial services segment increasing million  or  over to million in current business environment worldwide credit markets and macroeconomic environment during  the economic downturn continued with high unemployment rates  reductions in consumer spending  a depressed housing market  lack of consumer credit  and a reduction in consumer confidence 
this macroeconomic environment lead to higher delinquencies and charge offs in our financial services business 
since april  the credit markets have become more active and our wholly owned bank subsidiary  world s foremost bank wfb  successfully completed a talf program securitization as well as renewed two variable funding facilities 
wfb also completed an additional securitization transaction for million on february   under the talf program 
although we believe there have been significant improvements in the credit markets since april  we remain cautious and will continue to closely monitor our debt covenant compliance provisions and our access to the credit markets 
our financial services business continues to monitor developments in the securitization and certificates of deposit markets to ensure adequate access to liquidity 
developments in legislation and regulation on may   the card act was signed into law 
the card act will affect various credit card practices of card issuers  including our financial services business  such as marketing  underwriting  pricing  billing and disclosure 
many of the provisions became effective in february  although some provisions were effective in august and some will take effect in august on july   the federal reserve issued interim final rules to implement those provisions of the card act that became effective on august  on september   the federal reserve issued proposed rules and on january   issued final rules to implement the provisions of the card act which became effective on february  the remaining provisions of the card act go into effect on august   and will be implemented by the federal reserve at a later date 
among other things  the card act requires creditors to provide written notice to consumers days before increasing an annual percentage rate on a credit card account or making a significant change to the terms of a credit card account 
creditors must also inform consumers of their right to cancel the credit card account before the increase or change goes into effect in the same notice 
if a consumer cancels the account  the creditor is generally prohibited from applying the increase or change to the account 
requires creditors to mail or deliver periodic statements for credit card accounts at least days before payment is due  restricts annual percentage rate increases on outstanding balances except under limited circumstances  restricts interest rate increases during the first year an account is opened except under limited circumstances  requires creditors that increase annual percentage rates due to credit criteria  market conditions  or other factors to review accounts at least every six months to determine whether the annual percentage rate should be reduced  requires creditors to obtain the credit card account holders opt in in order to assess an over limit fee and places restrictions on fees charged for over limit transactions  restricts fees that may be charged for making a payment  requires creditors to allocate payments in excess of the required minimum payment to balances with the highest annual percentage rate before balances with a lower rate  requires fees to be reasonable and proportionate based on the violation of the terms of the cardholder agreement  requires payment due dates to be the same day each month  requires posting of all agreements on the internet  limits the ability to charge finance charge in the month a cardholder transitions from transactor to revolver  restricts increasing the annual percentage rate on existing balances  including restrictions on the ability to have minimum annual percentage rates floors on variable rate accounts  requires that a cardholder s ability to repay be determined before opening a credit card account or increasing a credit limit  restricts issuance of a credit card to a consumer under the age of  and requires expanded statement disclosures  such as minimum payment warning 
the card act also requires the federal reserve to conduct various studies  including studies regarding interchange fees  credit limit reductions  financial literacy  marketing  and credit card terms and conditions 
future legislation or regulations may be issued as a result of these studies 
in addition to the card act  the federal reserve also issued an amendment to regulation z at the end of provisions in the december amendments to regulation z that were not superseded by the card act remain scheduled to take effect on july   as originally provided in the december amendments 
these amendments will require additional enhanced disclosures to consumers on cardholder agreements  statements  and applications 
full implementation of the card act requires the promulgation of regulations by the federal reserve 
the federal reserve has issued final regulations implementing the majority of the provisions of the card act 
wfb continues to evaluate the effects of the card act and is making changes that the card act requires to be implemented in a relatively short timeframe 
other changes must await final regulatory guidance from the federal reserve 
wfb is continuing to evaluate appropriate modifications to its products  revenue generation  marketing strategies  and other business practices that will be in compliance with the law 
the full impact of the card act on wfb is unknown at this time as it ultimately depends upon continued regulatory actions and successful implementation of wfb s strategies 
compliance with the card act provisions could result in reduced interest income and other fee income 
wfb issued changes in terms effective july to lessen the effects of the card act 
on june   the obama administration released its white paper the white paper for proposed reform of the financial system 
proposed reforms which could materially affect wfb include the elimination of the exemption from the definition of bank under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca for credit card banks  such as wfb and increased supervision and regulation of financial firms 
since the issuance of the white paper  different forms of legislation to implement the administration s plan have been introduced in both houses of the congress 
the bills  though different at present  address risks to the economy and the payments system  especially those posed by large systemically significant financial firms  through a variety of measures  including regulatory oversight of nonbanking entities  increased capital requirements  enhanced authority to limit activities and growth  changes in supervisory authority  resolution authority for failed financial firms  enhanced regulation of derivatives and asset backed securities  restrictions on executive compensation  and oversight of credit rating agencies 
due to the complexity and controversial nature of the proposed bills  modifications are likely and the final legislation  if any  may differ significantly from the administration s original proposal 
additionally  compliance with potential increased regulation and scrutiny by multiple state and federal agencies may reduce wfb s profitability  which could negatively impact our business 
it is unclear whether any enacted legislation will preserve  eliminate  or modify the exemption for credit card banks under the bhca 
if such exemption were eliminated or modified  we may be required to divest our ownership of wfb unless we were willing and able to become a bank holding company under the bhca 
any such forced divestiture would materially adversely affect our business and results of operation 
impact of new accounting pronouncements the guidance of accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidations  and asc topic  transfers and servicing  resulted in the consolidation of the cabela s master credit card trust and related entities collectively referred to as the trust effective january  the following table shows our consolidated balance sheet as of january   including the assets and liabilities of the trust 
the consolidation of the trust eliminated retained interests in securitized loans and required the establishment of an allowance for loan losses on the securitized credit card loans 
the liabilities of the trust will be recorded as secured borrowings 
the secured borrowings still contain the legal isolation requirements which would protect the assets pledged as collateral for the securitization investors as well as protecting cabela s and wfb from any liability from default on the notes 
effect of january  january  adopting after asc asc adoption assets cash and cash equivalents   accounts receivable and inventories  net   restricted credit card loans   unrestricted credit card loans    allowance for loan losses on credit cards    credit card loans  net    prepaid expenses and other current assets    total current assets    property  equipment  and land held for sale  net   retained interests in securitized loans  net   economic development bonds and other assets   total assets   liabilities and stockholders equity accruals and other current liabilities    secured variable funding obligations of the trust   current maturities of secured long term obligations of the trust   current maturities of cabela s long term debt   income taxes payable and deferred income taxes    total current liabilities    secured long term obligations of the trust  less current maturities   long term debt of cabela s  less current maturities   other long term liabilities and deferred income taxes   total liabilities    common stock and additional paid in capital   retained earnings    accumulated other comprehensive income loss  total stockholders equity    total liabilities and stockholders equity  for fiscal  the results of operations of our financial services business will now look similar to our non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap presentation for financial performance of the total managed portfolio of credit card loans  excluding income derived from the changes in the valuation of our interest only strip  cash reserve accounts  and cash accounts associated with the securitized loans 
on january   the office of the comptroller of the currency  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the office of thrift supervision  and the federal reserve collectively  the federal agencies issued final rules relating to changes to regulatory capital as a result of asc topics and wfb s required capital will be increased with the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of the trust on wfb s balance sheet under asc topics and the final rule provides an optional two quarter delay and subsequent two quarter phase in for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk based capital relating to the assets that must be consolidated as a result of the change in accounting principles 
the effect of changes to regulatory capital requirements is expected to cause us to contribute approximately million in additional capital to wfb during to meet the capital needs of our financial services business 
we had sufficient cash at january   to provide the necessary capital contribution to wfb so wfb can meet the regulatory capital requirements for the well capitalized classification for effective december   we amended the terms of our credit agreement to allow us to contribute to wfb up to million of capital in plus up to million of capital per year through june   when this credit agreement expires 
asc topics and may also eliminate our ability to rely on the federal deposit insurance corporation s fdic regulation relating to the treatment of financial assets transferred in a securitization transaction 
in november  the fdic announced an interim amendment of this regulation 
under the interim amendment  the legal isolation of property transferred in a securitization transaction prior to march   is preserved  regardless of whether the transfer qualifies for sale accounting treatment under new accounting standards if the transfer otherwise complies with the fdic s regulation 
on december   the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in order to solicit public comments on proposed amendments to the fdic s regulation that apply to securitization transactions completed after march  we cannot predict the terms and conditions of the fdic s ultimate regulation relating to the treatment of financial assets transferred in a securitization 
until these issues are resolved  our ability to complete new securitization transactions after march   on acceptable terms or at all may be adversely affected

because the financial performance of the total managed portfolio has a significant impact on earnings we receive from servicing the portfolio  management believes that evaluating the components of our financial services revenue for both owned loans and securitized loans  as presented below in the non gaap presentation  is important to analyzing results

bank asset quality overview we securitize a majority of our credit card loans 
on a quarterly basis  we transfer eligible credit card loans into a securitization trust 
we are required to own at least a minimum twenty day average of of the interests in the securitization trust 
our transferor s interest totaled million at the end of accordingly  retained credit card loans have the same characteristics as credit card loans sold to outside investors 
certain accounts are ineligible for securitization for reasons such as account delinquency  they originated from sources other than cabela s club visa credit cards  or various other reasons 
loans ineligible for securitization totaled million at the end of compared to million at the end of the quality of our managed credit card loan portfolio at any time reflects  among other factors the creditworthiness of cardholders  general economic conditions  the success of our account management and collection activities  and the life cycle stage of the portfolio 
during periods of economic weakness  delinquencies and net charge offs are more likely to increase 
we have mitigated periods of economic weakness by selecting a customer base that is very creditworthy 
the median fico scores of our credit cardholders were at the end of compared to at the end of the following table shows our managed credit card loans outstanding at the end of and segregated by the number of months passed since the accounts were opened 
loans percentage loans percentage months since account opened outstanding of total outstanding of total dollars in thousands months or less   months   months   months   months   months   months   months   more than months   total   delinquencies we consider the entire balance of an account  including any accrued interest and fees  delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date 
our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which a customer has failed to make a required payment 
the following chart shows the percentage of our managed credit card loans that were delinquent at year end number of days delinquent greater than days greater than days greater than days charge offs charge offs consist of the uncollectible principal  interest  and fees on a customer s account 
recoveries are the amounts collected on previously charged off accounts 
most bankcard issuers charge off accounts at days 
we charge off credit card loans on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum days contractually delinquent to allow us to manage the collection process more efficiently 
accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies  cardholder deaths  and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier 
our charge off activity for the managed portfolio is summarized below for the years ended dollars in thousands charge offs    recoveries    net charge offs    net charge offs as a percentage of average managed credit card loans for  net charge offs as a percentage of average managed credit card loans increased to  up basis points compared to for  principally because of the challenging economic environment

liquidity and capital resources overview we believe that we will have sufficient capital available from cash on hand  our revolving credit facility  and other borrowing sources to fund our foreseeable cash requirements and near term growth plans 
at the end of and  cash on a consolidated basis totaled million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was cash at our financial services business segment which will be utilized to meet this segment s liquidity requirements 
in  our financial services business completed a term securitization totaling million  renewed and increased a million variable funding facility to million  and renewed and increased a million variable funding facility to million 
we will continue to evaluate additional funding sources to determine the most cost effective source of funds for our financial services business segment 
these potential sources include  among others  certificates of deposit and securitizations 
our retail and direct business segments and our financial services business segment have significantly differing liquidity and capital needs 
the primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores  purchases of inventory  investments in our management information systems and infrastructure  purchases of economic development bonds related to the construction of new retail stores  and general working capital needs 
we historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations  borrowing under revolving credit facilities  issuing debt and equity securities  obtaining economic development grants from state and local governments in connection with developing our retail stores  collecting principal and interest payments on our economic development bonds  and from the retirement of economic development bonds 
retail and direct business segments the cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal  with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from april through november 
while we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities  other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods 
these sources historically have included short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets 
while we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods  if any disruption occurred to our funding sources  or if we underestimated our cash needs  we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness  which could result in reduced revenue and profits 
our unsecured million revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage  a fixed charge coverage ratio  a cash flow leverage ratio  and a minimum tangible net worth standard 
in the event that we failed to comply with these covenants and the failure to comply would go beyond days  a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable 
at january   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through the next months 
in addition  recent and unprecedented distress in the worldwide credit markets has had an adverse impact on the availability of credit 
although our unsecured million revolving credit facility does not expire until june  continued market deterioration could jeopardize the counterparty obligations of one or more of the banks participating in our facility  which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are not able to replace such credit facility or find other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 
we currently expect all participating banks to provide funding as needed pursuant to the terms of our credit facility 
financial services business segment world s foremost bank or wfb the primary cash requirements of wfb relate to the financing of credit card loans 
these cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders balances or spending increase 
wfb sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities  which includes funding obtained from securitization transactions  borrowing under its federal funds purchase agreements  obtaining brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit  and generating cash from operations 
on april   wfb completed a term securitization transaction for million 
the most senior class of asset backed notes issued in that transaction qualified as eligible collateral under the talf program provided by the federal reserve bank of new york frbny 
the talf program is designed to increase credit availability and support economic activity by facilitating renewed issuance of consumer and business asset backed securities at more normal interest rate spreads 
under the talf program  the frbny provided non recourse funding to eligible investors who purchased talf eligible asset backed notes sponsored by wfb 
no funding was provided directly to wfb 
the talf program will cease making new loans secured by eligible collateral backed by credit card receivables on march   unless the board of governors of the federal reserve system extends the facility 
during the term that the talf facility is making new loans secured by eligible collateral backed by credit card receivables  wfb will have the ability to sponsor the issuance of additional classes of talf eligible asset backed notes  subject to certain limitations 
among other things  i the aggregate amount of talf eligible asset backed notes sponsored by wfb may not exceed the aggregate amount of the asset backed notes sponsored by wfb that matured in or will mature in the first quarter of  ii the talf eligible asset backed notes must satisfy the frbny s risk assessment requirements  and iii the talf eligible asset backed notes must be rated in the highest long term or short term investment grade rating category by two or more eligible nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros and must not be rated below the highest investment grade rating category from any eligible nrsro or be on review or watch for downgrade by any nrsro 
wfb does not have any significant continuing obligations under the talf program  except that under certain circumstances wfb must notify the frbny and investors if the asset backed notes cease to qualify as eligible collateral under the talf program and wfb agrees to provide certain information regarding the asset backed notes to the frbny 
on june   the trust renewed and increased a million variable funding facility to a million variable funding facility that will mature on june  on september   the trust renewed and increased a million variable funding facility to a million variable funding facility that will mature on september  wfb completed an additional securitization transaction for million on february   under the talf program 
in addition to this securitization  in wfb intends to renew its two variable funding facilities  issue additional certificates of deposits  and receive a capital contribution from cabela s 
we believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund wfb s foreseeable cash requirements and near term growth plans 
effective december   we amended the terms of our credit agreement to allow us to contribute up to million of capital to wfb in plus up to million of capital per year through june   when this credit agreement expires 
before this amendment the amount of capital we could contribute to wfb was million in any fiscal year or million in the aggregate 
we made million capital contributions to wfb in november and december wfb is prohibited by regulations from lending money to cabela s or other affiliates 
wfb is subject to capital requirements imposed by nebraska banking laws and the visa membership rules  and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by nebraska and federal banking laws 
if there are any disruptions in the credit markets  our financial services business  like many other financial institutions  may increase its funding from certificates of deposit which may result in increased competition in the deposits market with less funds available or at unattractive rates 
our ability to issue certificates of deposit is reliant on our current regulatory capital levels 
wfb is classified as a well capitalized bank  the highest category under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
if wfb were to be classified as an adequately capitalized bank  which is the next level category down from well capitalized  we would be required to obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to continue to issue certificates of deposits and would be limited to what interest rate we can pay on deposits 
in addition to the non brokered certificates of deposit market to fund growth and maturing securitizations  we have access to the brokered certificates of deposit market through multiple financial institutions for liquidity and funding purposes 
while we intend to finance our growth initiatives and operations with existing cash  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility  we may require additional financing to support our growth initiatives and operations 
the ability of our financial services business to engage in securitization transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  which could materially affect our business and cause our financial services business to lose an important source of capital 
as a result of the guidance under asc topics and  there is some uncertainty over existing fdic guidance regarding standards for legal isolation of the transferred assets 
if fdic rule cfr section treatment by the federal deposit insurance corporation as conservator or receiver of financial assets transferred by an insured depository institution in connection with a securitization or participation on legal isolation is not modified our securitizations will no longer have the benefit of the current rule as they will not meet all of the conditions for sale accounting treatment under gaap 
in november  the fdic announced an interim amendment of this regulation 
under the interim amendment  the legal isolation of property transferred in a securitization transaction prior to march   is preserved  regardless of whether the transfer qualifies for sale accounting treatment under new accounting standards if the transfer otherwise complies with the fdic s regulation 
on december   the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in order to solicit public comments on proposed amendments to the fdic s regulation that apply to securitization transactions completed after march  we cannot predict the terms and conditions of the fdic s ultimate regulation relating to the treatment of financial assets transferred in a securitization 
until these issues are resolved  our ability to complete new securitization transactions after march   on acceptable terms or at all may be adversely affected 
furthermore  wfb s securitized credit card loans could experience poor performance  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates  or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds 
this could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in wfb s securitization transactions  cause early amortization or early redemption of these securities  or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
asc topic  consolidations  and asc topic  transfers and servicing  resulted in the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of the trust as of january  consequently  there was a material impact on our total assets  total liabilities  retained earnings and other comprehensive income  statement of cash flows  and components of our financial services revenue 
we have evaluated the impact that these accounting standards will have on our compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements and unsecured notes and do not believe that these accounting standards  if they were effective as of january   would have caused us to be in breach of any financial covenants in our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we can offer no assurances that the impact from the provisions of these standards will not cause us to breach financial covenants in our credit agreements and unsecured notes in the future 
on january   the federal agencies issued final rules entitled risk based capital guidelines  capital adequacy guidelines  capital maintenance  regulatory capital  impact of modifications to generally accepted accounting principles  consolidation of asset backed commercial paper programs  and other related issues relating to changes to regulatory capital as a result of asc topics and wfb s required capital will be increased with the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of the trust on wfb s balance sheet under asc topics and the effect of changes to regulatory capital requirements resulting from the final rules issued by the federal agencies will cause us to reallocate capital from our retail and direct businesses to meet the capital needs of our financial services business  or require us to raise additional debt or equity capital  which in turn could significantly alter our growth initiatives 
also  if wfb fails to satisfy the requirements for the well capitalized classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  wfb would become subject to regulatory restrictions and wfb s ability to issue certificates of deposit could be affected 
the final rule provides an optional two quarter delay and subsequent two quarter phase in for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk based capital relating to the assets that must be consolidated as a result of the change in accounting principles 
the effect of changes to regulatory capital requirements is expected to cause us to contribute approximately million in additional capital to our bank subsidiary during to meet the capital needs of our financial services business 
we had sufficient cash at january   to provide the necessary capital contribution to wfb so wfb can meet the regulatory capital requirements for the well capitalized classification for effective december   we amended the terms of our credit agreement to allow us to contribute to wfb up to million of capital in plus up to million of capital per year through june   when this credit agreement expires 
the credit facility is unsecured and expires on june  advances under the credit facility are used for our general business support  including working capital support 
we paid million to the lending banks to facilitate the amendment

partially offsetting these improvements in cash was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million between years  mostly due to the reduction in inventory in compared to the net change in the liability for gift instruments and credit card reward points was a decrease of million over from increased sales of gift cards in compared to in addition  the net change in current and deferred income taxes payable was a decrease of million in compared to due to nearly million paid in for federal and state income taxes 
investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million for compared to this net decrease was primarily due to less expenditures related to the development and construction of the new retail stores in compared to for  cash paid for property and equipment additions totaled million compared to million for economic development bonds totaling million related to our mitchell  south dakota  retail store were retired in and bonds totaling million were retired in we purchased million of economic development bonds in compared to million in  and used million in the september acquisition of sir warehouse sports in winnipeg  manitoba 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased million for compared to this net decrease between years from financing activities was due to a net change in wfb s short term borrowings of million primarily from the repayment of a variable funding facility credit agreement and a net decrease of million in borrowings primarily on lines of credit for working capital and inventory financing 
in addition  long term debt decreased million comparing years due to prepayment of debt at the end of partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in time deposits at the end of compared to  which wfb utilized to help fund its credit card operations  resulting in a net change in cash flows of million between years 
grants and economic development bonds in the past  we have negotiated economic development arrangements relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores  including free land  monetary grants  and the recapture of incremental sales  property  or other taxes through economic development bonds  with many local and state governments 
we design our retail stores to provide exciting tourist and entertainment shopping experiences for the entire family 
our retail stores also employ many people from the local community  draw customer traffic from a broad geographic range  and serve as a catalyst for the opening of additional retail businesses such as restaurants  hotels  and gas stations in the surrounding areas 
we believe these factors increase the revenue for the state and the local municipality where the retail store is located  making us a compelling partner for community development and expansion 
where appropriate  we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores 
economic development bonds through economic development bonds  the state or local government sells bonds to provide funding for land acquisition  readying the site  building infrastructure and related eligible expenses associated with the construction and equipping of our retail stores 
in the past  we have primarily been the sole purchaser of these bonds 
the bond proceeds that are received by the governmental entity are then used to fund the construction and equipping of new retail stores and related infrastructure development 
while purchasing these bonds involves an initial cash outlay by us in connection with a new store  some or all of these costs can be recaptured through the repayments of the bonds 
the payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales  property  or lodging taxes generated from the store and  in some cases  from businesses in the surrounding area  over periods which range between and years 
in addition  some of the bonds that we have purchased may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds 
however  the governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds 
after purchasing the bonds  we typically record them on our consolidated balance sheet classified as available for sale and value them based upon management s projections of the amount of tax revenue expected to be generated to support principal and interest payments on the bonds 
because of the unique features of each project  there is no independent market data for valuation of these types of bonds 
if sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties  we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
at january   and december   economic development bonds totaled million and million  respectively 
the negotiation of these economic development arrangements has been important to our retail store expansion in the past  and these arrangements may be an important factor in our retail store expansion strategy in certain locations because they allow us to avoid or recapture a portion of the costs involved with opening a new store 
grants we generally have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding 
the commitments  such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open  typically phase out over approximately five to ten years 
if we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period  the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise  which could affect our cash flows and profitability 
at january   and december   the total amount of grant funding subject to specific contractual remedies was million and million  respectively 
securitization of credit card loans our financial services business historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program 
we sell our credit card loans in the ordinary course of business through variable funding facilities and longer term fixed and floating rate securitization transactions 
in a variable funding securitization  our credit card loans are converted into securities and sold to commercial paper issuers  which pool the securities with those of other issuers 
the amount securitized in a variable funding structure is allowed to fluctuate within the terms of the facility  which may provide greater flexibility for liquidity needs 
the trust issues to outside investors various forms of notes each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the trust 
the trust pays to the holders of the notes a portion of future scheduled cash flows under preset terms and conditions  the receipt of which is dependent upon cash flows generated by the underlying performance of the assets of the trust 
wfb retains a transferor s interest in the securitized loans  which ranks equal with the investor certificates and notes  an interest only strip  which represents the right to receive excess cash available after repayment of all amounts to the investors  servicing fees  cash reserve accounts and cash accounts in some cases as added protection for investors  and asset backed securities from its securitizations 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against wfb beyond the assets of the trust  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties  and covenants and minimum account balance levels which must be maintained to support our retained interests 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and the related indemnities do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the loans 
wfb records its interest only strips as an asset at fair value  which is an amount equal to the estimated present value of cash flows to be received by wfb over the expected outstanding period of the loans 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and late fees in excess of the amounts paid to note holders  credit losses  and servicing and administration fees 
wfb uses certain valuation assumptions related to the average lives of the loans sold  anticipated finance charge yields  and anticipated credit losses  as well as a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved  in determining the estimated present value of the interest only strips 
changes in the average life of the loans sold  finance charge yields  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could adversely impact the actual value of the interest only strips 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used 
gains and losses on securitization transactions  fair value adjustments  and earnings on our securitizations are included in consolidated revenue in the consolidated statement of income 
the cash accounts  asset backed securities  interest only strips  and cash reserve accounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as retained interests in securitized loans 
the transferor s interest is included in credit card loans 
all of wfb s securitization transactions are currently accounted for as sale transactions 
as a result  the loans relating to those pools of assets are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  other than wfb s transferor s interest  cash reserve accounts  asset backed securities and interest only strips 
a credit card loan represents a financial asset 
unlike a mortgage or other closed end loan account  the terms of a credit card account permit a customer to borrow additional amounts and to repay each month an amount the customer chooses  subject to a monthly minimum payment requirement 
the credit card account remains open after repayment of the balance and the customer may continue to use it to borrow additional amounts 
wfb reserves the right to change the credit card account terms  including interest rates and fees  in accordance with the terms of the credit card agreement and applicable law 
the credit card account is  therefore  separate and distinct from the loan 
in a credit card securitization  the credit card account relationships are not sold to the securitization entity 
wfb retains ownership of the credit card account relationship  including the right to change the terms of the credit card account 
the total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of january   were as follows third party total investor third party available available investor expected series type capacity capacity outstanding interest rate maturity dollars in thousands series i term    fixed october series i term    floating october series iii term    fixed october series iii term    floating october series i term    fixed december series i term    floating december series iv term    fixed september series iv term    floating september series i term  fixed march series i term    floating march total term    series i variable funding    floating september series iii variable funding    floating june total variable    total available    the trust entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the floating rate notes with a notional amount of million into a fixed rate obligation 
we have been  and will continue to be  particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for wfb 
a failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of wfb 
unfavorable conditions in the asset backed securities markets generally  including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements  could have a similar effect 
during  wfb completed securitizations totaling billion and renewed a million variable funding facility 
on april   a securitization transaction for million was completed under the talf program established by the frbny 
this securitization transaction refinanced asset backed notes that matured in on june   the trust renewed and increased a million variable funding facility to a million variable funding facility that will mature on june  on september   the trust renewed and increased a million variable funding facility to a million variable funding facility that will mature on september  wfb completed an additional securitization transaction for million on february   under the talf program 
in addition to this securitization  in wfb intends to renew its two variable funding facilities  issue additional certificates of deposits  and receive a capital contribution from cabela s 
we believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund wfb s foreseeable cash requirements and near term growth plans 
furthermore  wfb s securitized credit card loans could experience poor performance  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates  or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds 
this could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in wfb s securitization transactions  cause early amortization or early redemption of these securities  or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
certificates of deposit wfb utilizes brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activities 
wfb issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities 
at january   wfb had million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from january to april and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
this outstanding balance compares to million at december   with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years 
we cannot assure  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables provide summary information concerning our future contractual obligations at january  effective january   the debt of the trust relating to credit card loan securitization transactions approximating billion will be reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and will increase our total contractual obligations accordingly 
the liabilities of the trust will be recorded as secured borrowings and the general assets of cabela s are not available to repay any related maturities 
thereafter total in thousands long term debt      interest payments       capital lease obligations        operating leases        time deposits by maturity       obligations under new store and expansion arrangements      purchase obligations      deferred compensation unrecognized tax benefits   total    includes million owed under our million credit agreement for operations in canada 
excludes amounts owed under capital lease obligations 
these amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facilities because the amount that will be borrowed under these facilities in future years is uncertain 
at january   obligations for new store and expansion arrangements include approximately million of estimated contractual obligations and commitments associated with projected retail store related expansion and certain obligations under economic development bonds 
the table does not include any amounts for contractual obligations associated with retail store locations where we are in the process of certain negotiations 
our purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of inventory  shipping  and other goods and services in the ordinary course of business under binding purchase orders or contracts 
the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders or contracts we had outstanding at the end of under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders  or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable laws  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the preceding table would be less 
the following tables provide summary information concerning other commercial commitments at january  in thousands letters of credit  standby letters of credit  revolving line of credit for boat and atv inventory  open account document instructions  bank federal funds total  our credit agreement allows for maximum borrowings of million including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
at january   the total amount of borrowings under this revolving line of credit  including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit  was million 
our credit agreement for operations in canada is for million cad  with million cad available for borrowing at january  the line of credit for boat and all terrain vehicles financing is limited by the aforementioned million revolving line of credit to million of secured collateral 
the maximum amount that can be borrowed on the federal funds agreements is million 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases we lease various items of office equipment and buildings 
rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling  distribution  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table 
credit card limits wfb bears off balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business 
one form of this risk is through wfb s commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits 
the aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled billion above existing balances at the end of these funding obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
while wfb has not experienced  and does not anticipate that it will experience  a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders  such an event would create a cash need at wfb which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources 
wfb has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time 
securitizations all of wfb s securitization transactions have been accounted for as sales transactions  and the credit card loans and associated debt relating to those pools of assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at january  critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of cabela s board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions 
our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates 
should actual results be different than our estimates  we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that are material 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below represent accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise revenue recognition revenue is recognized on our internet and catalog sales when merchandise is delivered to customers at the point of delivery  with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer 
we recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations 
had our estimate of merchandise in transit to customers and our estimate of product returns been different by at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
sales of gift instruments are recorded in merchandise revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise and as a liability prior to redemption 
we recognize breakage on gift instruments as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote 
had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by of the recorded liability at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
inventories we estimate provisions for inventory shrinkage  damaged goods returned values  and obsolete and slow moving items based on historical loss and product performance statistics and future merchandising objectives 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future impacting these estimates  actual losses can be higher or lower based on future merchandising decisions and retail economic trends 
had our estimated inventory reserves been different by at the end of  our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
catalog costs deferred catalog costs consist of incremental internal and third party direct costs incurred in the development  production  and circulation of our direct mail catalogs  composed principally of creative design  prepress production  paper  printing  postal  and mailing costs 
deferred catalog costs are amortized over their expected period of future benefit or twelve months  whichever is shorter  based upon sales forecasts developed using historical sales for similar catalog offerings 
deferred catalog expenses are evaluated for recoverability at each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to actual sales data and to projected future cash flows 
had our amortization estimate of deferred catalog costs been different by for  our catalog costs expense would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
economic development bonds we recognize economic development bond investments based on estimates of the discounted future cash payments to be received under these bonds 
these estimates are also the basis for our recognition of deferred grant revenue to be received under the economic development grants as an offset to construction costs which is amortized over the asset lives of the development 
these cash flow estimates are dependent on property and or sales tax collections derived from our operations  and potentially other businesses  some of which may be in the development stage 
had our fair value estimates been lower by as of the end of  the value of economic development bonds reflected in our consolidated financial statements would have been approximately million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income loss if the loss was deemed to be temporary 
any declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method 
long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and other intangible assets  which generally are tested separately for impairment on an annual basis  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to that asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we then calculate an impairment loss 
the calculation for an impairment loss compares the carrying value of the asset to that asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows or quoted market prices 
we recognize an impairment loss if the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the newly adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over its remaining useful life 
frequently our impairment loss calculations contain multiple uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting cash flows under different scenarios  determining a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows  and incorporating financial data from other parties 
we have consistently applied our accounting methodologies that we use to assess impairment loss 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
asset securitization wfb securitizes the majority of its credit card loans  and recognizes gains or losses on the sales  as well as records certain retained interests  including transferor s interest  interest only strips  cash reserve accounts  cash accounts  and asset backed securities  which are all subject to significant valuation assumptions 
the interests in securitized receivables  including interest only strips  cash reserve accounts  cash accounts  and asset backed securities  are reported at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the transferor s interest is reported at the lower of cost or market in the consolidated balance sheets 
on a quarterly basis  we reviewed and adjusted  as appropriate  the assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the related accounts recognized in connection with these securitization transactions 
if we had made different assumptions for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements  wfb s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
refer to note for the sensitivity analysis of the current fair value of the interest only strip  cash reserve  and cash accounts  and the impact on fair value from an immediate adverse change of and in the key economic assumptions used to determine fair value 
recent accounting standards and pronouncements effective december   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this statement apply to all financial instruments that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis 
the partial adoption of asc topic did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
effective december   we adopted the remaining provisions of asc topic that were delayed by the issuance of asc section  fair value measurements and disclosures overall implementation guidance and illustrations 
the adoption of the remaining provisions of asc topic  relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asc topic  business combinations  which replaced fas no 
asc topic establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic effective december   which applies prospectively to all business combinations entered into on or after such date 
the adoption of this statement had no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
any future acquisitions will be impacted by application of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued asc section  consolidation overall transition and effective date information 
this standard amends arb no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
we adopted the provisions of asc effective december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb updated asc topic  transfers and servicing 
the objective of this update is to provide implementation guidance on accounting for a transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing 
the update presumes that an initial transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase financing are considered part of the same arrangement linked transaction under asc topic however  if certain criteria are met  the initial transfer and repurchase financing shall not be evaluated as a linked transaction and shall not be evaluated under asc topic we adopted the update to asc topic effective december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb updated asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
this update changes the existing disclosure requirements in asc topic asc topic now requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
we adopted the updates to asc topic effective december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued the following update to asc section  fair value measurements and disclosures overall transition and open effective date information  update to asc section  investments debt and equity securities overall transition and open effective date information update to asc section  financial instruments overall transition and open effective date information asc indicates that when determining the fair value of an asset or liability that is not a level fair value measurement  an entity should assess whether the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased when compared with normal market conditions 
if the entity concludes that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity  a quoted price eg  observed transaction may not be determinative of fair value and may require a significant adjustment 
asc section modifies the requirements for recognizing other than temporarily impaired debt securities and changes the existing impairment model for such securities 
these statements also modify the presentation of other than temporary impairment losses and increase the frequency of and expand already required disclosures about other than temporary impairment for debt and equity securities 
asc section requires publicly traded companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments within the scope of asc in interim financial statements  adding to the current requirement to make those disclosures in annual financial statements 
this staff position also requires that companies disclose the method or methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments and a discussion of changes  if any  in the method or methods and significant assumptions during the period 
we adopted the provisions of these staff positions effective for the second quarter ended june  the adoption of these staff positions did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asc topic  subsequent events 
this statement requires management to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are either issued  or available to be issued 
asc topic also requires companies to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the fasb updated asc topic  consolidations  and asc topic  transfers and servicing  which significantly changed the accounting for transfers of financial assets and the criteria for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity vie 
the update to asc topic eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity qspe concept  establishes conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies the financial asset derecognition criteria  revises how interests retained by the transferor in a sale of financial assets initially are measured  and removes the guaranteed mortgage securitization recharacterization provisions 
the update to asc topic requires reporting entities to evaluate former qspes for consolidation  changes the approach to determining a vie s primary beneficiary from a mainly quantitative assessment to an exclusively qualitative assessment designed to identify a controlling financial interest  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
the application of asc topics and resulted in the consolidation of the trust s assets and liabilities effective january  consequently  there was a material impact on our total assets  total liabilities  retained earnings and other comprehensive income  statement of cash flows  and the components of our financial services revenue 
as a result of these accounting standards  the securitization transactions will be accounted for as secured borrowings  credit card loans and debt issued from the trust will be presented as assets and liabilities of the company  various other interests currently reflected on the consolidated balance sheet will be reclassified primarily to credit card loans  other current assets  and accrued expenses 
the financial services business will also be required to establish allowances for loan losses relating to such assets beginning in fiscal there will also be changes in the statement of cash flows 
the trust was consolidated on january   with total assets and liabilities increasing approximately billion and billion  respectively  and retained earnings and other comprehensive income decreasing approximately million  after tax 
we have evaluated the impact that the guidance of asc topics and will have on our compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements and unsecured notes and do not believe that these standards  if they were effective as of january   would have caused us to be in breach of any financial covenants in our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we can offer no assurances that the impact from the provisions of these standards will not cause us to breach financial covenants in our credit agreements and unsecured notes in the future 
on january   the federal agencies issued final rules entitled risk based capital guidelines  capital adequacy guidelines  capital maintenance  regulatory capital  impact of modifications to generally accepted accounting principles  consolidation of asset backed commercial paper programs  and other related issues relating to changes to regulatory capital as a result of asc topics and wfb s required capital will be increased with the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of the trust on wfb s balance sheet under asc topics and the effect of changes to regulatory capital requirements resulting from the final rules issued by the federal agencies  will cause us to reallocate capital from our retail and direct businesses to meet the capital needs of our financial services business  or require us to raise additional debt or equity capital  which in turn could significantly alter our growth initiatives 
also  if wfb fails to satisfy the requirements for the well capitalized classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  wfb would become subject to regulatory restrictions and wfb s ability to issue certificates of deposit could be affected 
the final rule provides an optional two quarter delay and subsequent two quarter phase in for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk based capital relating to the assets that must be consolidated as a result of the change in accounting principles 
the effect of changes to regulatory capital requirements is expected to cause us to contribute approximately million in additional capital to our bank subsidiary during to meet the capital needs of our financial services business 
we had sufficient cash at january   to provide the necessary capital contribution to wfb so wfb can meet the regulatory capital requirements for the well capitalized classification for effective december   we amended the terms of our credit agreement to allow us to contribute to wfb up to million of capital in plus up to million of capital per year through june   when this credit agreement expires 
in june  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
this codification is the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
we adopted the provisions of fas no 
effective june  the adoption of this statement did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our bank s operations and  to a lesser extent  through our merchandising operations 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk through our merchandising operations 
financial services interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to changes in earnings or the net present value of assets and off balance sheet positions  less liabilities termed economic value of equity due to interest rate changes 
to the extent that interest income collected on managed credit card loans and interest expense do not respond equally to changes in interest rates  or that rates do not change uniformly  securitization earnings and economic value of equity could be affected 
our net interest income on managed credit card loans is affected primarily by changes in short term interest rate indices such as libor 
at the end of  the variable rate credit card loans were indexed to the prime rate 
to mitigate our interest rate risk  beginning january  the variable rate credit loans were indexed to one month libor and the credit card portfolio was segmented into risk based pricing tiers each with a different interest margin 
securitization notes are indexed to libor based rates of interest and are periodically repriced 
certificates of deposit are priced at the current prevailing market rate at the time of issuance 
we manage and mitigate our interest rate sensitivity through several techniques  but primarily by indexing the customer rates to the same index as our cost of funds 
additional techniques we use include managing the maturity  repricing  and distribution of assets and liabilities by issuing fixed rate securitization notes and entering into interest rate swaps 
the table below shows the mix of our managed credit card account balances at the years ended as a percentage of total balances outstanding balances carrying an interest rate based upon various interest rate indices balances carrying an interest rate of balances carrying an interest rate of balances not carrying interest because their previous month s balance was paid in full charges on the credit cards issued by our financial services segment were priced at a margin over various defined lending rates  subject to certain interest rate floors 
no interest is charged if the account is paid in full within days of the billing cycle  which represented of total balances outstanding at december  some of the zero percentage promotion expenses are passed through to the merchandise vendors for each specific promotion offered 
management has performed several interest rate risk analyses to measure the effects of the timing of the repricing of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
based on these analyses  we believe that an immediate increase of basis points  or  in the london interbank offered rate on interest charged to customers and on our cost of funds  would cause a pre tax decrease to earnings of million for our financial services segment over the next twelve months 
merchandising business interest rate risk the interest payable on our line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt increased  our interest expense and results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
foreign currency risk we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the united states in transactions that are primarily u 
s 
dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the u 
s 
dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us 
a decline in the relative value of the u 
s 
dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased merchandise costs 
for our retail store in canada  we intend to fund all transactions in canadian dollars and utilize our unsecured revolving credit agreement of million cad to fund such operations
