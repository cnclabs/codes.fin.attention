item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report 
overview we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers  therefore  we are subject to the volatile and unpredictable cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry 
the semiconductor equipment industry historically has experienced ups and downs  some of them more pronounced than others 
in the second half of  global economic conditions deteriorated which negatively affected consumer spending on electronics and  as a result  the downturn in the semiconductor industry worsened significantly 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we took various actions to reduce our cost structure  including reducing our worldwide workforce  salaries  bonuses  and other operating and capital expenditures 
the economic trend continued through the first half of in the third quarter of  we saw some strengthening of the global economy and the semiconductor industry and  due to our cost structure improvements and operational efficiencies  we were able to limit our losses to one quarter and generate positive earnings and operating cash flows for the full year our light source system shipments have historically tracked the semiconductor equipment cycle  while our installed base products and the associated revenue have scaled with utilization of our light sources in the field and the growth of our installed base of light source systems 
as a result  for the full year  our installed base products revenue was million  or percent of our total revenue 
we also continued to make significant progress demonstrating the value of our onpulse contracts  and we now have over  light sources globally under onpulse coverage at the end of in the third quarter of  we shipped the industry s first laser produced plasma euv lithography prototype source system to asml  and expect to record our first sale of an euv pilot source system to asml during progress continues with our euv source development and commercialization as we have several pilot units in assembly in our san diego manufacturing facility 
we plan to deliver these units to asml in  and we are focused on meeting asml s power and collector specifications and milestones 
we are committed to successful euv source development and commercialization  and we continue to make the necessary investment in support of this goal 
in the third quarter of  tcz shipped and installed its first laser crystallization system for the oled flat panel display market at a large korean display manufacturer 
tcz is working with this display maker to demonstrate the systems differentiated throughput and the superior uniformity of tcz s laser crystallization technology 
in january  we purchased zeiss s ownership in tcz  resulting in full ownership of tcz by us 
zeiss will continue to provide tcz relevant intellectual property licenses  ongoing research and development  and manufacturing of optical modules 
the change in ownership does not affect the current tcz product and services roadmaps 
in addition  marked the introduction and installation of the industry s first field selectable to watt immersion light source  the xlrix 
chipmaker light source investment was  and we expect will continue to be  focused on arf immersion 
we believe our immersion light source products are well positioned to support our direct lithography and chipmaker customers with our xlr platform  led by the xlrix 
we are proud of our quick return to operating profitability and positive operating cash flow generation in as we enter  the outlook for our industry and our business is encouraging 
increased demand for consumer electronic products such as pcs  netbooks  smart phones  and solid state drives  is fueling the need for advanced semiconductors 
this has resulted in improved dram prices  chipmaker profitability  and lower inventory levels  and is providing chipmakers with the confidence to make nm and below technology investments in immersion lithography 
our business environment is strengthening  and we view as a growth 
table of contents and investment year for the company 
from a growth perspective  we expect increased chipmaker advanced arf immersion lithography technology buys  combined with growing orders for krf in support of capacity additions 
we also expect chipmaker utilization to remain at or above fourth quarter levels for the foreseeable future  resulting in strong demand for installed base product support 
from an investment perspective  we will continue to invest in our laser produced plasma euv light source technology and commercialization  and we intend to work closely with leading oled display makers on process development using tcz s laser crystallization system 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our ongoing internal processes  we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments associated with revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  income taxes  allowances for doubtful accounts  long lived assets valuation  goodwill valuation  assets and liabilities valuation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates and judgments upon historical information  projected information  and other facts and assumptions that we believe to be valid and or reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions and facts form the basis for making judgments and estimates and for determining the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
adverse global economic conditions  illiquid credit markets  volatile equity  foreign currency fluctuations and declines in consumer spending have increased the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  particularly those related to the condition of the economy  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranty obligations  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets valuation  and income taxes require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements than do other of our accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition our revenues include light source systems and installed base products  which consist of onpulse contracts  service support and replacement parts  and to a lesser extent  training  service  upgrades  and refurbishments of our light source systems 
we anticipate that our future revenues will also include sales of our euv and tcz systems and associated installed base products 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable at the date of sale  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our sales arrangements do not include general rights of return or cancellation privileges 
light source systems we recognize light source system revenue at one of following three points  depending on the terms of our arrangement with our customer shipment of the light source system  delivery of the light source system  or receipt of an acceptance certificate from the customer 
for the majority of our light source system sales  the shipping terms are fob shipping point  and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
on a limited basis  certain of our revenue arrangements include additional elements  such as future product upgrades or services 
we adopted the revised authoritative guidance for revenue recognition arrangements with 
table of contents multiple deliverables during the fourth quarter of  and retroactively applied the guidance to new or materially modified revenue arrangements entered into on or after january   in accordance with the early adoption rules 
the guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements  by establishing a revised hierarchy for determining the selling price of each deliverable 
under the new guidance  the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
under the prior guidance  elements could only be unbundled if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value was available for the undelivered elements 
the revised guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements as all revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements during was computed using the relative fair value method as fair value existed for all elements within the arrangements 
we have two arrangements that will require the use of an estimated selling price for certain of the elements within these arrangements  and all revenue has been deferred under both arrangements as the systems have not yet been accepted 
for arrangements that fall under the new multiple element guidance  we allocate consideration to the multiple elements using the relative selling price of the delivered and undelivered items  based on vendor specific objective evidence or estimated selling price  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  as third party evidence is generally not available to us due to the proprietary nature of our products 
selling price is determined considering market conditions  estimated gross margins  as well as factors that are specific to us 
for arrangements that fell under the prior multiple element guidance  we allocated consideration to the multiple elements using the relative fair value model if fair value vendor specific objective evidence existed for all elements in the arrangement 
alternatively  we applied the residual method of allocation if fair value vendor specific objective evidence only existed for the undelivered elements 
if fair value did not exist for the undelivered elements  no revenue was recognized until such elements were delivered 
through  our light source system sales have been of our duv light source systems only 
we shipped our first euv prototype source system to asml in  and expect to record our first sale of an euv pilot source system to asml during installed base products onpulse contracts  replacement parts  and service support revenue associated with our onpulse contracts  which include primarily replacement parts and to a much lesser extent services  is recognized monthly based on the number of pulses utilized by our customers on their laser source systems that are covered under their onpulse arrangement 
revenue from service and training is recognized as the services are rendered 
to date  the revenue associated with the service element of our onpulse contracts when combined with our service revenue has been less than of our total revenue 
for our replacement part sales  the shipping terms are fob shipping point  and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
for a significant portion of our replacement parts revenue  our customers return the consumed assembly to us as part of the sale of the new part 
we reuse some of the material within these core assemblies  mainly metal components  for the future build of core assemblies 
as a result  our revenue consists of both cash and the fair value of the reusable parts received from our customers as consideration for these replacement part sales 
revenue associated with our customers return of core assemblies is recognized upon receipt of the returned core assembly 
the amount of the revenue is determined based upon the fair value of the reusable parts that we expect to yield from the returned core assembly based on historical experience 
if the return of the core assembly is related to a part being replaced under our warranty provisions or under a service or support contract with our customer  we will recognize the estimated fair value of the reusable component as a reduction to cost of revenue 

table of contents on a limited basis  we sell upgrades for our light source systems or refurbish light source systems owned by our customers to their original or new condition 
revenue from upgrades is recognized when the upgrade has been successfully installed by us and accepted by the customer 
revenue from refurbished light source systems is recognized when the refurbishment process has been completed and  depending upon the customer  the proper delivery or acceptance terms have been met 
tcz products the sale of our initial tcz system includes installation services  training services and technical support services  which are expected to be delivered over discrete time periods 
revenue will be allocated to each deliverable in the transaction based on estimated selling prices 
the initial tcz sale also includes an acceptance provision  which had not been met as of december  therefore  during  we shipped one tcz system  but did not recognize any revenue 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents payments received from our customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements as described above 
inventory valuation our inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or estimated market value 
our inventories include raw materials  work in process  finished goods  and replacement and reusable parts  which we use in our refurbishment activities and our onpulse arrangements 
as part of our regular business activities  we conduct parts refurbishment and material reclaim activities related to some of our core assemblies  particularly our chamber assemblies 
these activities involve arrangements with our customers where we sell a new part to the customer at a reduced sales price if the customer returns the consumed core assembly that the new part replaces 
the fair value of the reusable parts contained within the consumed assembly is recorded in inventory based upon historical data on the value of the reusable parts that we typically yield from a consumed core assembly 
obsolete inventory  or inventory for which we do not have expected usage based on our forecasted demand  is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
the methodologies used to analyze excess and obsolete inventory and determine the value of our inventory are significantly affected by future demand and usage of our products 
there are many factors that could potentially affect the future demand or usage of our products  including the following condition of the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical in nature  rate at which our lithography tool manufacturers and chipmaker customers take delivery of our light source systems and our replacement parts  loss of any of our major customers or a significant change in demand from any of these customers  overall mix of light source system models or replacement parts and any changes to that mix required by our customers  utilization rates of our light sources at chipmakers  overall condition of the global economy which can positively or negatively impact the demand for our products  customer acceptance of new products or discontinued use of our products  and engineering change orders 

table of contents based upon our experience  we believe that the estimates we use to calculate the value of our inventories are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
during changing or adverse economic conditions  it is difficult to estimate the future demand for our products 
as a result  the likelihood that the usage period for our inventory will substantially differ from our estimates is increased 
if actual demand or the usage periods of our inventory are substantially different from our estimates  such differences may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
warranty obligations we maintain an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties associated with our sales of light source systems and replacement parts 
warranty costs include replacement parts and labor costs to repair our light source system products during the warranty period 
at the time revenue is recognized for the sales of light source systems and replacement parts  we record a warranty provision in cost of revenues 
the warranty coverage period is typically two years  however  the period and terms for light source systems and replacement parts can vary by light source system model 
the warranty provision for our products is determined by using a statistical financial model  which takes into consideration actual historical expenses  product failure rates  and potential risks associated with our different products 
this model is then used to estimate future warranty costs and the required warranty provision 
the risk levels and historical cost data and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated as these inputs change over the light source system product life cycle 
due to the highly technical nature of our light source system products  the newer model light sources and the modules contained within them have higher inherent warranty risks with their initial shipments and require higher warranty provisions until the technology becomes more mature 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  however  our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures at customer sites 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex light source systems 
although we classify these newly released light source system models as having a higher risk in our warranty model resulting in higher warranty provisions  we are more likely to have differences between the estimated and actual warranty costs for these new light source system products 
warranty provisions for our older and more established light source system models are more predictable as more historical data is available on these products 
if actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures were to differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
stock based compensation the fair value of stock based compensation awards is measured on the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the fair value of the stock award is determined using the black scholes option pricing model for stock options and the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions including the expected term of the stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the stock options 
we use a combination of historical and implied volatility blended volatility to determine the expected stock volatility that we include in the black scholes option pricing model to value our stock options 
historical volatility is based on a period commensurate with the expected term of the options 
implied volatility is derived based on six month traded options of our common stock 
an estimated forfeiture rate is applied and included in the calculation of stock based compensation expense at the time that the stock option or other stock awards  such as our restricted stock unit awards  are granted and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates 
if we change any of the key assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model as described above  or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future or change our forfeiture rate  the 
table of contents compensation expense that we record may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in prior periods and could materially affect our operating results 
our key assumptions  such as volatility and forfeiture rates  can be materially affected during changing or adverse economic conditions 
we also grant performance restricted stock units prsus to our executive officers and certain key employees under our long term incentive program 
prsus are a form of share based award in which the number of shares ultimately received will be determined based on our relative performance compared to a specified group of peer companies over a three year performance period and eligible individual s management by objectives mbo achievement during the same three year performance period 
we record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of prsus that will be issued 
this estimate requires significant estimates and projections about our financial performance relative to the financial performance of the specified group of peer companies  and the performance of individuals against their specific mbos 
if our estimates change or actual results are different than the estimates used in prior periods  we would be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could materially affect our operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to lithography tool manufacturers or semiconductor manufacturer customers located throughout the world 
in order to monitor potential credit losses  we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectability of our accounts receivable 
we take into consideration the following when making this assessment  our customer s payment history and how current they are on paying their outstanding receivables balance  our history of successfully collecting on past due or aged receivables from our customers  our customer s current financial condition and any circumstances of which we are aware that would affect our customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  and our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and global economy and their effect on our customers 
if circumstances change  and the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us  or the judgments used by us to determine a customer s allowance prove to be incorrect  we may need to record additional allowances 
when global economic conditions are changing or adverse  the likelihood that our customers will be unable to meet their financial obligations to us increases  and it becomes more difficult to assess our customers likelihood to meet their financial obligations to us 
in addition  due to our concentrated customer base  the trade receivable balance owed by any one customer can be significant 
as a result  if our assessment of the financial condition of our customers  even a single customer  proves to be incorrect  we would have to record additional and potentially significant allowances and bad debt expense  which would have a material effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
long lived assets valuation included in our long lived assets are property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to be generated by the asset 
assets are 
table of contents grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if such assets are considered to be not recoverable ie the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment is measured and recorded based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
significant judgments and estimates by management are required to project cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the long lived assets 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  our strategic plans with regard to our business and operations  assumptions about expected future operating performance  and the interpretation of current and future economic indicators 
when global economic conditions are changing or adverse  it is very difficult to estimate future cash flows as it requires management to make judgments on when and how quickly the economy and our business will recover 
to the extent that the judgments used by us to calculate our future cash flows prove to be inaccurate or there are significant changes in market conditions  the overall condition of the global economy or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusions regarding long lived asset impairment could change 
this could result in significant impairment charges  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial position 
income taxes our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
these changes to the valuation allowance  and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense  could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues product sales product sales related party total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses operating income other income expense income before income tax provision income tax provision net income net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary net income attributable to cymer  inc we currently operate within two reportable segments  cymer and tcz 
the cymer segment of our business consists of products including photolithography light sources and installed base products 
the tcz segment is targeting the emerging market for ltps processing used in the manufacture of oled flat panel displays

table of contents for purposes of calculating the average selling price  we have excluded the effect of deferred light source system revenue between periods in order to present the actual price per light source system sold 
total revenue decreased in compared to due to a decline in our light source system revenue and a decline in our installed base product revenue 
in  the decrease in light source revenue was primarily due to the decline in the number of light source systems sold as a result of the reduced need for capacity expansion by our chipmaker customers  the continued downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the continued deterioration of the global economy 
this decline was offset partially by an increase in the average selling price due to a higher concentration of sales of our most advanced arf light sources for immersion productions applications  which include our xlr series light source systems 
arf light source systems accounted for of light source system revenue for compared to of light source system revenue for we expect sales of our arf systems to continue to grow at a higher rate than sales of our krf systems as customers continue to adopt more advanced technologies 
although our installed based product revenue declined from to due to a decline in pulse utilizations by our chipmaker customers  it did not decline as significantly as our light source systems revenue 
this was due to continued adoption of our onpulse contracts and an increase in the number of installed light source systems from  as of december  to  as of december  total revenue decreased in compared to due to a decline in our light source system revenue  offset partially by a increase in our installed base product revenue in as compared to a total of light source systems were sold in compared to light source systems sold in the decrease in light source systems revenue was due to the lower number of light source systems that we sold as a result of the reduced need for capacity expansion by our chipmaker customers  the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the deterioration of the global economy in the average selling price of these light source systems increased to million in from million in this increase in the average selling price was due to the continued adoption of our most advanced arf light sources for high volume immersion production applications which include our xlr series light source system 
arf light source systems accounted for of light source systems revenue for compared to of light source system revenue for our installed base product revenues increased in from the levels 
these higher revenues from year to year were due to the growth of our installed base and increasing pulse utilization in the first half of  the strong adoption of our onpulse contracts and the sale of other laser productivity enhancements such as glx 
there were no revenues associated with our tcz segment for the year ended december   or in august  tcz shipped one system but has not yet recognized revenue as the agreement includes acceptance provisions which have not yet been satisfied 
our backlog includes only those orders for duv light source systems and replacement parts for which we have accepted a purchase order from a customer  and that will be delivered to the customer within the following months 
in addition  our backlog does not include service or support which will be provided to our customers in the future or under service contracts 
our backlog does not include orders for euv source systems or tcz products  as these products are still in evaluation stages at our customers 
because it is the practice in our industry that customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty  our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 
our duv backlog at december  was million compared to million at december  duv bookings for the year ended december  and were million and  respectively 
the duv book to bill ratio for the quarter ended december  was compared to for the quarter ended december  the decrease in bookings year over year primarily reflects the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry as a result of the global economy 
the slight increase in duv backlog and book to bill ratio reflects an increase in demand for our light source systems in the second half of

cost of revenues includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  installation expenses  license fees  and manufacturing and service overhead 
cost of revenues also includes foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts forward contracts associated with purchases of our products by cymer japan for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized 
amounts billed to a customer  if any  for shipping and handling are reported as revenue 
the decrease in gross margin to in from in was primarily due to million in idle capacity charges and higher costs associated with our installed base products 
the idle capacity charges were associated with unabsorbed manufacturing costs resulting primarily from the decline in light source demand and reduced production levels during these declines in gross margin were offset partially by lower warranty expenses in as percentage of revenue due to a lower number of systems under warranty and a reduction in the write down of inventory compared to we expect gross margin in to be higher than due primarily to a decrease in idle capacity charges 
the decrease in gross margin to in from in was primarily due to higher costs associated with our installed base products and a million write down of our inventory in response to the decreased demand for our products and increased risk of parts on hand being in excess of demand  and increased warranty expenses compared to cost of revenues associated with the tcz segment was  for this cost of revenues is associated with the installation costs incurred during the third quarter of to install the first system at a customer site

we anticipate that research and development expenses in will be higher than as we develop enhancements to our current duv product line and continue to invest in euv and tcz product development 
additionally  we expect to incur increased compensation and benefit costs due to the reinstatement of certain employee benefits and variable compensation programs in the increase in research and development costs in compared to were primarily due to costs associated with our increased focus on euv light source development and product development efforts associated with tcz  which were offset by decreases in variable compensation costs of million associated with our incentive bonus program  some of which we were able to fund in but did not fund in research and development expenses for the tcz segment decreased to million for from million for due primarily to a change in depreciation expense associated with certain demonstration equipment that was fully depreciated in sales and marketing

higher bad debt expense in  driven by the uncertain impact of the recessionary economy on our customers  drove a favorable year over year comparison 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in will be higher than as we incur increased compensation and benefit costs due to the reinstatement of certain employee benefits and variable compensation programs in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in variable compensation costs associated with our incentive bonus programs some of which we were able to fund in but did not fund in in  we also reversed million in bonuses recorded for long term incentive bonus programs for employees who were terminated in in addition  professional fees decreased million from to primarily due to decreases in professional accounting service fees related to the adoption and implementation of a new tax authoritative guidance 
these decreased expenses were offset by increases in salaries  benefits and travel expenses of million  and a  impairment expense related to certain capital equipment 
we recorded bad debt expense of million as a result of certain customers who were identified as being at risk as a result of the impact by the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the global economy 
we also incurred increases in general operating expenses related to our facilities of  in compared to general and administrative expenses associated with the tcz segment were  in   in and million in the increase in from was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits including variable costs associated with the tcz incentive program  whereas the decrease in from was due primarily to a decrease in compensation and benefits including reduced variable costs associated with the tcz incentive program 
restructuring 
we incurred restructuring expenses  primarily consisting of severance charges  of million in compared to million in in november  we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately percent or a total of employees 
in the first quarter of  we further reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately percent or a total of employees as part of our cost reduction efforts in response 
table of contents to the deterioration in the global economy and lithography sector of the semiconductor capital equipment market in the fourth quarter of and the first half of as a result of these actions to reduce our cost structure  we realized a cost savings of approximately million from to in our research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we did not record any restructuring expense in  and there were no restructuring expenses associated with our tcz segment for   or total other income expense net 
net other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio  foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with fluctuations in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries against the us dollar  interest expense incurred on our convertible subordinated notes that were outstanding until february and write down of investments 
net other expense totaled  for compared to net other expense of million for and net other income of million for the reduction in expense from to was primarily due to a significant reduction in interest expense as a result of the repayment of our convertible subordinated note in february  decreases in foreign currency losses and significantly reduced write downs on investments 
foreign currency losses were million for and were primarily due to the lower volatility in the korean won against the us dollar as a result of the positive impact of our hedging program 
in foreign currency losses were million and were caused by a significant decline in the value of the korean won against the u 
s dollar 
impairment charges on the preferred stock that was distributed to us when the sole auction rate security was dissolved were  for which reduced the carrying amount of the auction rate preferred stock to zero  compared to impairment charges on our auction rate security of million for in addition  these decreases in other expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in interest and other income year over year as a result of lower overall cash and investment balances and lower interest rate yields 
the change from net other income in to net other expense in was primarily due to a significant reduction in interest income from year to year as a result of lower overall cash and investment balances and lower interest rate yields and foreign currency exchange losses of million which we recorded during as compared to foreign currency gains of million  which we recorded during this change from foreign currency exchange gains to losses from year to year is primarily due to the volatility of the foreign currencies in which our subsidiary offices conduct business as measured against the us dollar 
in the second half of  several of these currencies strengthened against the us dollar  whereas in the second half of  their value  particularly that of the korean won and the euro  significantly declined against the us dollar 
in addition  in due to the crisis in the credit market and the significant downgrading of our sole auction rate security  we recorded an other than temporary impairment totaling million 
total net other income associated with the tcz segment were  for compared to net other expense of  for and net other income of  for we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of  during as compared to foreign currency exchange losses of  during the foreign currency exchange gains in were primarily driven by changes in the value of trade payables denominated in euro  partially offset by changes in the value of cash denominated in euro  whereas the foreign currency exchange losses in were primarily due to cash balances held by tcz during in euro and singapore dollars 
in addition  we recorded lower interest income of  during compared to interest income of  during due to lower interest rates yields earned during as compared to we recorded foreign currency exchange losses of  during as compared to foreign currency exchange gains of  during primarily due to cash balances held by tcz during in non functional currencies such as the euro and singapore dollars 
in addition  we recorded interest income of  during compared to interest income of  during due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates during as compared to income tax expense 
income tax expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  reflects an annual effective rate of  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate from to was due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
during  we realized a capital loss of million and provided a full valuation allowance on the related million deferred tax asset  as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not generate sufficient capital gains to 
table of contents utilize the capital loss after consideration of our available tax planning strategies 
in addition  the effect of certain foreign losses with no tax benefit had a larger effect on than due to the fact that the foreign losses remained relatively constant  while pre tax income declined significantly from to the decrease in the effective rate from to was due to the large investment in euv technology resulting in a research and development credit on lower profit before tax in the annual effective tax rates for and were less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences such as the research and development tax credits  and the manufacturing activity deduction under internal revenue code section our future annual effective tax rate depends on various factors  such as potential changes to the tax laws in both the us and foreign jurisdictions and the geographic compositions of our pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from operations  the proceeds from note offerings  and proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
we have also from time to time utilized cash to repurchase shares of our common stock 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  and million in working capital 
we also had million in restricted cash which is associated with a secured refund bond that we entered into and was required by tcz s customer related to a sale to them 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in as compared to was primarily due to the use of cash to repay our convertible subordinated notes and accrued interest which totaled million  partially offset by cash generated by operating activities 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million and primarily reflects net income for the year as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges including depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  a reduction in inventory levels  increases in accounts payable and accounts payable related party  and increases in deferred revenue 
these increases in cash were offset by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in accrued and other liabilities 
the million decrease in inventory was primarily due to decreases in our spare parts inventory levels during these decreases in our spare parts inventory levels were partially offset by increases in inventory related to euv systems that are being built to fulfill our first euv order with asml and increases in inventory related to tcz systems 
the increases in accounts payable and accounts payable related party of million and million  respectively  primarily reflects inventory purchases related to euv systems and inventory related to tcz systems 
the increase in deferred revenue of million primarily reflects prepayments received from asml during for purchase orders received from them under a multi year euv supply agreement 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of a higher level of shipments occurring later in the fourth quarter  which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances at the end of the year 
the decrease in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in our warranty provision as a result of reduced sales and the lower number of light source systems that are currently under warranty 
net cash used in operating activities in totaled million and primarily reflects lower net income for the year as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges  a significant increase in inventory levels  decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and changes in the balances of income taxes payable and accrued income taxes 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue during the increase in inventory was primarily due to increases in our field inventory to support the increased utilization of our light sources  to provide replacement parts availability  optimize field inventory to support xlr light source systems installation and to support our onpulse agreements 
in addition  the increases in inventory also included inventory related to our euv systems and tcz joint venture 
the use of cash for accrued expenses and other liabilities was due primarily to short term bonuses that were earned in and paid in the first quarter of the decrease in accounts payable reflects 
table of contents the reduction in inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of due to the downturn in the global economy and semiconductor industry 
the changes in income tax accounts were primarily due to significant tax payments made during the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of collection efforts and lower accounts receivable balances 
the increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects prepayments received from asml during for purchase orders received from them under a multi year euv supply agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities in of million reflects net income  as adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash charges  decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
these sources of operating cash were partially offset by an increase in inventory levels 
the decrease in the receivable balance was primarily the result of collection efforts 
the increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects prepayments received from asml for purchase orders received from them under a multi year euv supply agreement 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily related to the increased inventory levels and the increase in inventory was primarily due to the increased production of replacement parts to support and provide service to our installed base of light sources 
investment activities 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of million of purchases of short term and long term securities net of reinvestment of such securities during the year 
in addition  cash used in investing activities included the acquisition of million of property and equipment  a significant portion of which relates to equipment associated with our euv research  development and productization efforts  software and equipment purchases  and equipment purchases related to tcz 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of the acquisition of million of property and equipment  a significant portion of which relates to building improvement costs and engineering equipment associated with our euv research  development and productization efforts 
this use of cash was offset by proceeds from sold or matured short term and long term securities net of reinvestment of such securities during the year 
a portion of the proceeds from sold and matured investments during the year was used to fund our stock repurchase program 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of proceeds from sold or matured investments  partially offset by purchases of investments and the acquisition of property and equipment used by us in the normal course of business 
a portion of the proceeds from sold and matured investments during the year was used to fund our stock repurchase program 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  which primarily reflects the payment of million for the redemption of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes that matured on february  this payment was partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan totaling million  an additional cash investment received from zeiss  the tcz minority shareholder  in the amount of  and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of  net cash used in financing activities for was million which was due primarily to the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock under our board approved stock repurchase program 
this use of cash was partially offset by million in proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million additional cash investment received from zeiss  the tcz minority shareholder

this use of cash in financing activities was slightly offset by the million in proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  a million additional cash investment received from zeiss  the tcz minority shareholder  and million in excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises 

table of contents effect of exchange rate changes 
most of our foreign subsidiaries operate in currencies other than the us dollar  and the majority of their cash balances are denominated in these foreign currencies 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these currencies against the us dollar at the end of each reporting period 
several of the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate have experienced volatility over the past several years 
the net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  when expressed in us dollar terms  was an increase in cash of  for the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million for the year ended december  and an increase of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the impact on cash was primarily due to the relationship of the korean won  the euro and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
specifically  cash and cash equivalents were positively affected by  due to the korean won and the euro strengthening against the us dollar and the effect it had on the cash balances denominated in these currencies held at our subsidiary offices 
this increase was offset by  due to the weakening of the japanese yen against the us dollar 
for the year ended december   we experienced significant volatility in the value of the korean won  and to a lesser extent  the euro  which resulted in a decrease of cash of million for the year ended december  not only did the korean won weaken dramatically against the us dollar in  but we had significant cash balances denominated in korean won as of december  as a result  cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by million due to the korean won weakening during the year 
this decrease was offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen against the us dollar and as a result  the cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by million due to the japanese yen strengthening during the year 
for the year ended december   cash was positively impacted by million primarily due to the japanese yen and the euro strengthening against the us dollar and the impacts it had on the cash balances denominated in these currencies held at our subsidiary offices 
prospective capital needs 
we require substantial resources to fund the operations of our business  particularly to fund our investment in new technologies  including inventory and capital in support of these technologies 
we expect purchases of property and equipment in to be approximately million  a significant portion of which will relate to purchases of equipment associated with euv research and development  as well as purchases of software and equipment 
in addition  we require resources to fund our normal operations 
due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in tcz  effective january   we are obligated to pay our former partner in tcz  zeiss  approximately million by september  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  cash from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase by our employees of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs for our normal operations  and our investments in our new technologies  including euv and oled display manufacturing  for at least the next months 
it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities or to acquire assets  products or new technologies beyond the next months 
we may also decide that it is prudent in the current business and economic environment to secure commitments to access additional capital  including equity or debt securities  to protect our long term liquidity position 
we continue to monitor and control expenditures for on going operations 
in april  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
as of december   we have million remaining of this authorization 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the required investments in our new technologies such as euv and oled display manufacturing  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets in which we operate  including the volatility in the semiconductor industry  and trends in the semiconductor markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  
table of contents the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  the timing and requirements of spending to support product development efforts and other operating costs  our competitors responses to our products and our anticipation of and responses to their products  the required investment to support tcz  our manufacturing activity  the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly during changing or adverse global economic conditions  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  the market acceptance of our products  competitive labor market compensation requirements  acquisitions of assets  products or new technologies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  our relationships with suppliers and customers  and the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases by our employees under our employee stock purchase plan 
transactions with related parties we periodically sell our light source systems to zeiss and we purchase certain optical parts from zeiss 
zeiss is considered to be a related party as a result of its ownership interests in tcz  our joint venture entity 
for a discussion of the business and transactions with zeiss  see note  related party transactions 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases acquisition of noncontrolling interest in tcz purchase obligations total commitments effective january   we purchased zeiss s forty percent ownership in tcz for approximately million cash  to be paid in full no later than september  purchase obligations represent firm purchase commitments by us at december  in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  at december   we had a gross liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions of approximately million 
because the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend on a number of factors  we are unable to project if and when this might occur  if at all  within the next five years 
accordingly  we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the amount and period of potential cash settlements  if any  with taxing authorities 

table of contents at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships with or enter into transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
we have no significant contractual obligations that are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements or fully disclosed in the notes thereto 
recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for a description of recent accounting standards  including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct business in several international currencies through our global operations 
prior to  our foreign currency hedging program included only the japanese yen 
in the first quarter of  we expanded our foreign currency hedging program to include the korean won  the euro and the taiwanese dollar due to increased exposures in these foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk falls into two primary categories 
first  we are subject to uncertain gross profit margins when we forecast selling products in one currency and the product costs are denominated in a different currency 
in this instance we enter into derivative financial instruments  principally forward contracts which we designate as cash flow hedges in order to mitigate fluctuations in the gross profit margins of these forecasted transactions 
forward contracts on forecasted transactions that hedge uncertain gross profit margins generally qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged transaction is recorded in the financial statements 
once the underlying transaction is recorded in the financial statements  we de designate the derivative  reclassify the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative into cost of revenues and cease to apply hedge accounting treatment 
once the derivative has been de designated  any further gains or losses are recorded to other income expense 
if all or a portion the forecasted transaction were cancelled  this would render all or a portion of the cash flow hedge ineffective and we would reclassify the ineffective portion of the hedge into other income expense 
we generally have not experienced ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges from cancelled transactions 
the fair value of all our forward contracts totaled to an asset of  at december  the deferred gain  net of tax  for those that qualified for hedge accounting treatment was  as of december  at december   we had outstanding forward contracts to buy million in exchange for japanese yen  million in exchange for korean won and to sell million in exchange for euros 
these contracts expire on various dates through july the second category of foreign currency risk occurs when transactions are recorded to our consolidated financial statements in a currency other than the applicable entity s functional currency and the cash settlement of the transaction occurs at some point in the future 
when transactions in non functional currency are recorded to our consolidated financial statements  any changes in the recorded amounts resulting from fluctuations in the value of that currency will be recorded to other income expense 
in order to mitigate these remeasurement gains 
table of contents and losses  we enter into derivative financial instruments  principally forward contracts 
the forward contracts that hedge transactions that have been recorded to our consolidated financial statements are not designated as hedges and we record changes in their fair value to other income expense in order to attempt to offset gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
for the year ended december   we recorded a foreign currency exchange loss which totaled million 
the foreign currency exchange loss was primarily attributable to the lower volatility in the korean won against the us dollar as a result of the positive impact of our hedging program 
this foreign currency loss is included in other income expense  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of for all currencies could be experienced in the near term 
these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the adverse impact at december  and december  is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately million and million  respectively from forward exchange contracts in place at that time 
these reasonably possible adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of were applied to net assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before taxes in the near term 
investment and debt risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  commercial paper and money market funds 
while it is our general intent to hold such securities until maturity  we will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
a change in market interest rates of would have impacted our net income from these investments by approximately  as of december  we hold preferred stock that was distributed to us when our sole auction rate security was dissolved in april the auction rate security was purchased in october at a par value of million and failed at every auction from november until its dissolution in april we recorded impairment charges in and totaling  and million  respectively  associated with this security which was included in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of operations 
this preferred stock is valued at zero at december   as we believe it is unlikely we will receive any future cash flow from this preferred stock 
on february   our convertible subordinated notes came due and we repaid the outstanding principal balance of million plus accrued interest of million
