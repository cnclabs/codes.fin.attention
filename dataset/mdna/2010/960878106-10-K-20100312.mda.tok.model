item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors contained in item above 
overview westmoreland coal company is an energy company employing  employees whose operations include five surface coal mines in montana  north dakota and texas and two coal fired power generating units with a total capacity of megawatts in north carolina 
we sold million tons of coal in our two principal operating segments are our coal segment and our power segment  in addition to two non operating segments 
we are a holding company and conduct our operations through subsidiaries  which generally have obtained separate financing 
as a holding company  we have significant cash requirements to fund our ongoing heritage health benefit costs  pension contributions  and corporate overhead expenses 
the principal sources of cash flow to us are distributions from our principal operating subsidiaries 
each of wml  rova and wri has a credit agreement that contains covenants applicable to that subsidiary 
only the wri agreement permits dividends to be paid by wri to us without restriction 
during  our rosebud and beulah mines customers had unscheduled outages following their planned maintenance outages 
the beulah mine customer ended its unscheduled outage and resumed coal deliveries in july however  deliveries to our rosebud mine s customer were significantly reduced until october when the customers acquired needed replacement equipment and they resumed operations 
the power plant outages at beulah and rosebud mines customers are referred to herein as the customer outages 
additionally  due to unfavorable current economic and energy market conditions  our absaloka and jewett mine s deliveries decreased 
these reductions reduced the dividends and cash flows available to us 
in october  during a planned major maintenance outage at one of our rova power plants  which occurs every five years  we determined that an unexpected repair was needed on the generator rotor 
this repair extended the outage and decreased revenues and operating income in the fourth quarter of the repair was made and operations resumed in november in december  we entered into an agreement with the united mine workers of america to modernize the method by which prescription drugs are provided to retirees of our former operations 
under the agreement  we will utilize a new system of distribution and administration  along with drug formularies  to enable us to continue to provide prescription drug benefits to retirees  but at a lower cost 
these modifications are expected to become effective around april  additionally in  we eliminated postretirement medical benefits for non represented employees and retirees effective september  and transitioned our retiree population to a new health provider network 
the collective effect of these changes coupled with favorable claims experience  favorable interest rates  and reductions in administrative fees  has resulted in a million reduction in our postretirement medical obligation with a correspondi ng decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we froze our pension plan for non represented employees effective july  and  as a result  future benefits will no longer accrue under this plan 
related to the plan freeze  we recorded a curtailment loss of million and a million decrease in our pension liability with a corresponding decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we have suffered recurring losses from operations  have a working capital deficit  a net capital deficiency  and expect to violate certain debt covenants in these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph that summarizes the salient facts or conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a result of wri s renewed revolving line of credit and increase in its term debt discussed below and the factors discussed in significant anticipated variances between and and related uncertainties  we anticipate that our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future thereafter  although by a small margin 
we do not currently expect to rely on proceeds from sales of assets or securities or other capital raising transactions in order to satisfy our liquidity needs in

significant anticipated variances between and and related uncertainties we expect a number of factors to result in differences in our results of operation  financial condition and liquidity in relative to we do not expect the heritage legal claim settlement  the reclamation claim  or the tax effect of other comprehensive income gains occurring in  as discussed in items that affect comparability of our results  to reoccur in fair value adjustments on derivatives may reoccur in but at levels not estimable 
additional factors that we expect to result in variances between and include the following we expect our overall coal tons delivered to increase as we experienced significant decreases in coal deliveries during as a result of unplanned customer outages 
we anticipate an increase in our coal segment operating profits due to the increased coal deliveries as well as more favorable terms and prices on several of our coal sales contracts that become effective in  we expect decreased heritage health benefit expenses and cash payments to retirees due to the elimination of postretirement medical benefits for our non represented employees and the agreement we entered into to modernize the method by which prescription drugs are provided to our retirees  we expect a decrease in our heritage segment s selling and administrative costs due to significant expenses in related to our cost containment efforts  we expect an increase in our power segment operating profits resulting from the completion of a planned maintenance outage that occurs every five years and a significant unplanned maintenance outage  which occurred in the fourth quarter of at our larger rova plant 
we expect this increase to be partially offset with a planned maintenance shutdown that occurs every five years at our second  smaller rova plant  in june  the fixed capacity payment that we receive at our second  smaller rova plant for each megawatt hour of electricity produced will step down to a lower rate which continues through the end of the power sales agreement in this decrease will result in a reduction in cash receipts  but will have no impact on our revenues as we begin recognition of this plant s previously deferred revenues 
a similar situation occurred in at our larger rova plant  we expect decreased pension expenses due to the freezing of one of our pension plans  which we expect to be partially offset with increased company contributions to employees k plans  we expect to have an increase in our required pension plan contributions resulting from the decline in the value of our pension investments and our loan covenants  which require us to maintain a funding status 
we expect to make a portion of these contributions in company stock  we expect an increase in our depreciation expense as a result of increased capital investments made during at our mining operations 
we expect to make additional capital investments during in the range of to million to improve our mining operations and increase productivity 
we expect these capital investments to be funded through our mine s operating cash flows  capital leases  or  if necessary  the mine s existing credit facilities  we expect an increase in our restricted investments and bond collateral in the range of to million primarily as a result of securing reclamation bonding as we enter new mining areas in  and we expect a reduction in our repayments of long term debt resulting from the refinancing in of our power debt 

table of contents we believe the net effect of the foregoing factors will result in improvements in our results of operations and cash flows in relative to our outlook for is based on the information we currently have available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results in and in subsequent years 
key operational uncertainties relating to our expectations are described in risk factors and item coal segment material effects of regulation and power segment material effects of regulation 
liquidity and capital resources we have suffered recurring losses from operations  have a working capital deficit  a net capital deficiency  and expect to violate certain debt covenants in these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph that summarizes the salient facts or conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a result of wri s renewed revolving line of credit and increase in its term debt discussed below and the factors discussed in significant anticipated variances between and and related uncertainties  we anticipate that our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future thereafter  although by a small margin 
we do not currently expect to rely on proceeds from sales of assets or securities or other capital raising transactions in order to satisfy our liquidity needs in our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal and power production to customers and borrowings under our credit facilities or other financing arrangements 
we generally satisfy our working capital requirements and fund capital expenditures and debt service obligations through cash generated from operations or borrowings under our credit facilities 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december   included in thousands wml westmoreland risk management westmoreland resources  inc westmoreland coal company parent other total consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounts outstanding  availability and average borrowings under the revolving lines of credit of our subsidiaries  at december   are as follows in millions total line of credit amounts outstanding letters of credit availability average borrowings wml wri rova the cash at wml and rova are available to us through quarterly distributions 
however  the loan agreements of wml and rova require debt service accounts and impose timing and other restrictions on the ability of rova and wml to distribute funds to us 
additionally  the wml and rova revolving lines of credit are only available to these operations 
wri can distribute cash drawn from its revolving line of credit to us through dividends 
because the wri loan agreement imposes fewer restrictions on the ability of wri to make distributions to us  wri has been a significant source of liquidity for us 
the cash at westmoreland risk management  our captive insurance subsidiary  is available to us through dividends  subject to maintaining a statutory minimum level of capital  which was million at december  
table of contents the primary factors impacting our liquidity in were as follows our pension obligations are primarily funded through cash generated from our subsidiary s operations 
these pension contributions by our subsidiaries reduce distributions available to us 
under certain circumstances  we are able to make a portion of these contributions in company stock 
the following table summarizes expenditures and contributions for our heritage health benefit and pension obligations in millions actual expected postretirement medical benefits pension contributions cbf premiums workers compensation benefits our heritage health obligations are funded by distributions from our operating subsidiaries 
our heritage health benefit costs consist of payments for postretirement medical benefits  workers compensation benefits  black lung benefits and combined benefit fund premiums 
we significantly reduced our heritage obligations in through plan amendments and entering into an agreement to modernize the method by which prescription drugs are provided to retirees 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these reductions 
of the contribution  million was made through the contribution of company stock 
our significant level of debt  as described below  and limitations under current debt agreements limits the ability of our subsidiaries  wml and rova  to pay dividends to us 
see below for our principal components and the maturities of our long term debt and detail on our covenant defaults during the year 
we anticipate that  as we permit additional areas for our mines in to continue our operations  our bonding requirements will increase significantly and the cash collateral requirements will increase as well 
unanticipated customer outages and an overall decrease in the demand for electricity had a significant impact our liquidity 
during  our rosebud and beulah mines customers had unscheduled outages following their planned maintenance outages 
the beulah mine customer ended its unscheduled outage and resumed coal deliveries in july however  deliveries to our rosebud mine s customer were significantly reduced until october when the customer acquired needed replacement equipment and operations resumed 
additionally  due to current unfavorable economic conditions in the energy market  our absaloka and jewett mine s deliveries decreased 
these reductions in planned deliveries reduced the dividends and cash flows available to us 
long term debt and covenants as of december   our total gross indebtedness was approximately million  with approximately million of that amount classified as current liabilities 
included in the million current portion of debt are million of wri term debt and million of convertible note debt  both of which have maturities after december  but are classified as current liabilities due to wri s anticipated loan covenant non compliance and related cross default impact on the convertible note  million of wri revolving line of credit which we anticipate will be extended prior to its november  expiration date  and million in our subsidiaries term debt  which matures over the next twelve months and is expected to be funded by cash provided by the operations of those subsidiaries 
convertible notes we have million in senior secured convertible notes million net of unamortized discount  which bear interest at a rate of per annum and are payable in full on march  our convertible notes are secured by a second lien on the assets of wri 

table of contents our covenants for our convertible notes contain affirmative and negative covenants  which limit our ability to dispose of assets  make investments  purchase or redeem our common stock  pay preferred dividends and merge with another corporation 
as discussed above  wri s anticipated non compliance with loan covenants could trigger a future cross default on our convertible notes 
we have classified million of its convertible note debt as a current liability due to the uncertainty of wri s future compliance with covenant requirements 
wml wml has million of fixed rate term debt outstanding at december   which bears interest at per annum  payable quarterly 
the term debt is payable in full on march  no principal payments are required for this debt until wml also has a revolver with a borrowing limit of million and maturity date of june  the interest rate under this revolver at december   was per annum 
at december   we had a letter of credit of million supported by the revolver leaving us million of unused borrowings 
the term debt and revolver are secured by substantially all assets of wml  our membership interest in wml  and primarily all of the stock of wml s subsidiaries 
wml s lending arrangements contain  among other conditions  events of default and various affirmative and negative covenants 
the financial ratios included in wml s term debt and revolving line of credit include a debt service coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
the debt service coverage ratio must remain within a specified range 
the leverage ratio requires that we not permit the ratio of total debt at the end of each quarter end to ebitda both as defined by the agreement for the four quarters then ended to be greater than a specified amount 
the wml covenants also set limits for capital expenditures 
as a result of customer outages  wml did not comply with its original leverage ratio covenant as of june   september   and december   and believes it will not comply with the original leverage ratio requirements as of march  on october   wml obtained a waiver from its lenders for the quarter ended june   and september  wml also received waivers for future leverage ratio non compliance for the quarters ended december   and march   provided wml meets certain conditions  including a revised leverage ratio covenant 
wml met the waiver requirements at december   and believes it will also meet the march   waiver requirements 
accordingly  the debt has been classified as long term 
we believe we will be able to meet all wml covenant requirements during wri wri s business loan agreement was amended in and the million revolving line of credit was extended to november  under the terms of the amended agreement  the limit of the term debt was increased to million  as a result of this increase  we received million in cash 
the amount of principal payments due in for the term debt is million 
the term debt s final payment is due january  the interest rate for the term debt and the revolver are payable at the prime rate 
the term debt and revolver are both currently subject to a per annum and floor  respectively 
at december   we had million of unused borrowings under the revolver 
the two debt instruments are collateralized by a first lien in wri s inventory  chattel paper  accounts and notes receivable  and equipment 
wcc is the guarantor of the debt under the agreement and its guaranty is secured by a pledge of wcc s interest in wri 
wri s business loan agreement requires it to comply with numerous covenants and minimum financial ratio requirements primarily related to debt coverage  tangible net worth  capital expenditures  and its operations 
the net worth covenant requires wri to have a net worth of not less than a specific amount  defined by the agreement  by a specific date  defined by the agreement  and maintain this net worth value thereafter 
covenants limit the amount of capital expenditures that can be made without prior consent of the lender 
the debt coverage covenant requires wri to maintain a ratio of operating income  as defined by the agreement  to debt service  as defined by the agreement  of not less than specified range at each quarter end and year end 
at september   primarily as a result of unfavorable market conditions driving decreases in tonnages sold  wri was not in compliance with a net worth requirement contained in its business loan agreement 
on october   wri obtained a waiver from its lenders for the quarter ended september  the agreement was amended on november   to extend the net worth requirement from september  to april  we believe we will not be able to meet the covenant requirement by april   and therefore have classified the entire outstanding balance of this term debt  million  as a current liability 
we do not believe that we will be able to comply with the net worth requirement during  however  we do believe we will meet all other covenants requirements contained in the agreement in 
table of contents as a result of our anticipated non compliance with the net worth requirement  wri s lenders may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us or modify the terms of our existing debt agreements 
in addition  the lenders may require the payment of additional fees  require prepayment of our indebtedness to them  accelerate the amortization schedule for our indebtedness or increase the interest rates they charge us on our outstanding indebtedness 
rova at december   rova has approximately million of fixed rate term debt outstanding with interest rates varying from to excluding million of unamortized debt premiums

rova s fixed rate term debt as well as the revolving loan are secured by a pledge of the quarterly cash distributions from rova 
rova is required to comply with certain loan covenants related to interest and fixed charge coverage 
as of december   rova was in compliance with such covenants 
historical sources and uses of cash the following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of the customer outages and cash outlays for our coal royalty disputes

our current maturities of long term debt increased as a result of the loan defaults at wri and the expected cross default discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and above 
the increases in our working capital deficit were offset by the decrease in our accounts payable balance primarily due to the payment of our coal royalty claims

our discount rate for postretirement medical benefit is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model  which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liability 
this model is calculated using a yield curve that is developed using the average yield for bonds in the tenth to ninetieth percentiles  which excludes bonds with outlier yields 
we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data and projecting forward the participant claims and our current benefit coverage 
these projections include cost savings from the modernization of the method by which prescription drugs are provided to retirees of our former operations 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 

table of contents below we have provided a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the significance of the health care cost trend rate assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
postretirement medical benefits health care cost trend rate increase decrease in thousands effect on service and interest cost components effect on postretirement medical benefit obligation asset retirement obligations  final reclamation costs and reserve estimates our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of cost estimates for final reclamation of surface land and support facilities at both surface mines and power plants in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws 
asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using estimates and assumptions including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the final reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different from curre ntly estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform final reclamation and mine closing activities 
certain of our customers have either agreed to reimburse us for final reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
these funds will serve as sources for use in final reclamation activities and directly reduce our reclamation expenses as we record a receivable for these future receipts

income taxes and deferred income taxes as of december   we had significant deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include federal and state regular net operating losses  or nols  alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards  indian coal tax credits  or ictc  carryforwards  and net deductible reversing temporary differences related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
we believe we will be taxed under the amt system for the foreseeable future due to the significant amount of statutory tax depletion in excess of book depletion expected to be generated by our mining operations 
as a result  we have determined that a valuation allowance is required for all of our regular federal net operating loss carryforwards and amt credit carryforwards since they are not available to reduce amt income in the future 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for all but million of our state nols since we believe they will not be realized 
no valuation allowance is being provided on million of deferred tax assets because we believe that these nols will be used to offset our liabilities relating to our uncertain tax positions 
we have determined that a full valuation allowance is required for all of our ictc carryforward 
the ictc can generally be used to offset amt liability 
we do not believe we have sufficient positive evidence of significant magnitude to substantiate that our deferred tax asset for the ictc carryforward is realizable at a more likely than not level of assurance 
as a result  we will continue to record a full valuation allowance on our ictc carryforward  reversing valuation allowance only if utilized in a future year 
we have determined that since our net deductible temporary differences will not reverse for the foreseeable future  and we are unable to forecast when we will have regular taxable income when they do reverse  a full valuation allowance is required for these deferred tax assets  other than the deferred tax asset relating to our uncertain tax positions 
the tax effect of pretax income or loss from continuing operations is generally determined by a computation that does not consider the tax effects of items that are not included in continuing operations 
the exception to that incremental approach is that all items for example  items recorded in other comprehensive income  extraordinary items  and discontinued operations be considered in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that shall be allocated to continuing operations

this statement prescribes a qualitative model for identifying whether a company has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity or vie and eliminates the quantitative model prescribed by asc a 
the new model identifies two primary characteristics of a controlling financial interest provides a company with the power to direct significant activities of the vie  and obligates a company to absorb losses of and or provides rights to receive benefits from the vie 
asc requires a company to reassess on an ongoing basis whether it holds a controlling financial interest in a vie 
a company that holds a controlling financial interest is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie and is required to consolidate the vie

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial instruments with off balance sheet risk such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
surety bonds and letters of credit are issued by financial institutions to third parties to assure the performance of our obligations relating to

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk we manage our price risk for coal sales  electricity and steam production through the use of long term agreements  rather than through the use of derivatives 
we estimate that almost of our coal and our electricity production are sold under long term agreements 
these coal contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised 
the price may be adjusted in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
we have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel and explosives 
we manage these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivatives from time to time 
as of december   we had derivative instruments outstanding for explosives  however  we do not consider our market risk for these instruments to be material 
at december   we had fuel supply contracts outstanding with a minimum purchase requirement of million gallons of diesel fuel per year 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception under hedge accounting 
interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our debt obligations shown in the table below that are indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
based on balances outstanding as of december   a change of one percentage point in the prime interest rate or libor would increase or decrease interest expense on an annual basis by the amount shown below in thousands effect of increase or decrease revolving lines of credit wri s term debt
