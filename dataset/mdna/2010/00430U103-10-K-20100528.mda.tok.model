item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties described in item a of this report 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to those risks and uncertainties 
overview our business we develop and commercialize scientific business intelligence software and solutions that enable our customers to accelerate the discovery and development of new drugs and materials 
our customers include pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other life science companies  as well as companies that are in the energy  chemicals  aerospace and consumer packaged goods markets 
our software and service solutions are used by our customers scientists  biologists  chemists and information technology professionals in order to aggregate  mine  integrate  analyze  simulate  manage and interactively report scientific data 
our customers include leading commercial  government and academic organizations 
many of the largest pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemicals  energy  aerospace and consumer packaged goods companies worldwide use our software 
we market our products and services worldwide  principally through our direct sales force  augmented by the use of third party distributors 
our marketplace historically  we have primarily sold molecular modeling and simulation software 
the market for molecular modeling and simulation products in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is challenging due to the maturity of the market  industry consolidation  reduction in the level of discovery research activity  and increased competition  including competition from open source software 
we also sell modeling and simulation products to the energy  aerospace  chemical and consumer packaged goods industries 
we believe these industries are in the early stages of adoption of these technologies 
thus we believe the market for our products within these industries is nascent 
following the acquisition of scitegic  we began offering data pipelining and workflow software 
this technology is widely applicable within our target industries and represents a significant growth opportunity in all industries which our computer aided modeling and simulation and cheminformatics products currently serve 
there is currently limited competition with this technology in our targeted industries 
our strategy we believe the combination of our scientific informatics platform and our computer aided design modeling and simulation software and service solutions enables our customers to better utilize their scientific data in order to solve critical business issues throughout their organizations 
our strategy is to continue to increase the use of our scientific informatics platform so that it remains the de facto standard scientific informatics platform in the industries we serve 
in order to increase the use of our platform we continue to develop advanced analysis and reporting component collections which operate with our scientific informatics platform in order to extend its capabilities and value to our customers 
our scientific informatics platform is also the basis of many of our service offerings  including offerings which integrate and enhance our customers software  thereby further increasing the use and value of our platform 
because our scientific informatics platform is the underlying operating platform for many products in our broad portfolio of computer aided design modeling and simulation software and service solutions  we expect the usage of these products to increase as the usage of our scientific informatics platform increases  thus further increasing our sales and value to our customers 
we also intend to 
table of contents market and distribute our solutions to a broader group of users  including scientists  engineers and information technology professionals within our existing customer base  as well as to new customers in other industries 
we also partner with other companies who provide scientific software and services in order to ensure that their software and service solutions operate with our scientific informatics platform  further proliferating its use and value to our customers 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the following primary sources software licenses  post contract customer support and maintenance services on licensed software  collectively referred to as pcs  and professional services 
customer billings generated in connection with our revenue generating activities are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
we then recognize the revenue from these customer billings as set forth below and when all of the following criteria are met a fully executed written contract and or purchase order has been obtained from the customer ie  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contractual price of the product or services has been defined and agreed to in the contract ie  price is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product or service has occurred and no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance of the delivered product or service exist  and collection of the purchase price from the customer is considered probable 
software licenses 
we license software predominantly on a term basis 
when sold perpetually  our standard perpetual software licensing arrangements generally include twelve months of bundled pcs  while our standard term based software licensing arrangements typically include pcs for the full duration of the term license 
because we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of these elements  we recognize as revenue the entire fee for such perpetual and term based licenses ratably over the term of the bundled pcs 
renewal of pcs under perpetual software licenses 
our pcs includes the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements and technical support 
fees from customer renewals of pcs related to previously purchased perpetual licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the pcs 

table of contents professional services 
we provide certain services to our customers  including non complex product training  installation  implementation and other professional services which are non essential to the operation of the software 
we also perform professional services for our customers designed to enhance the value of our software products by creating extensions to functionality to address a client s specific business needs 
when sold separately  revenue from these services is recorded under the proportional performance or completed performance method 
multi element arrangements 
for multi element arrangements which include software licenses  pcs and non complex training  installation and implementation services which are non essential to the operation of the software  the entire revenue and cost of revenue for such arrangements are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the pcs or the delivery of the services  whichever is longer 
for multi element arrangements which also include services that are essential to the operation of the software  the revenue and cost of revenue for such arrangements are generally deferred until the services essential to the operation of the software have been performed  at which point the entire revenue and cost of revenue for such arrangements are recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the pcs or the delivery of non essential services  whichever is longer 
valuation of goodwill our goodwill resulted from acquisitions in fiscal years through in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit 
our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
based on the guidance provided by asc topic and asc topic  segment reporting  management has determined that our company consists of one reporting unit given the similarities of economic characteristics between our operations and the common nature of our products  services and customers 
because we have only one reporting unit  and because we are publicly traded  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value 
our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets as of march  to our market capitalization 
because we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our market capitalization  our future reviews of goodwill for impairment may be impacted by changes in the price of our common stock 
for example  a significant decline in the price of our common stock may cause the fair value of our goodwill to fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of goodwill for impairment a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
valuation of indefinite lived intangible asset in connection with our acquisition of scitegic in september  we acquired the scitegic trade name which was determined to be indefinitely lived 
in accordance with asc topic  we review our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment at least annually in our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash 
table of contents flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of an asset 
our indefinite lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test and concluded that our indefinite lived intangible asset was not impaired 
we estimated the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis which considers the estimated future customer orders for our scientific informatics platform and the associated direct and incremental selling  marketing  and product development costs 
key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis include projections of future customer order growth for our scientific informatics platform and developing an appropriate discount rate 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows will materialize as estimated 
for example  if our projections of future customer order growth do not materialize  the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset may fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc topic and asc topic  property  plant and equipment  we review long lived assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
a long lived asset is considered to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s undiscounted future cash flows  we utilize our internal forecast of our future operating results and cash flows  our strategic business plans and anticipated future economic and market conditions 
there are inherent estimates and assumptions underlying this information and management s judgment is required in the application of this information to the determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
no assurance can be given that the underlying estimates and assumptions utilized in our determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows will materialize as anticipated 
valuation of marketable securities we assess our marketable securities for impairment under the guidance provided by asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
accordingly  we review the fair value of our marketable securities at least quarterly to determine if declines in the fair value of individual securities are other than temporary in nature 
if we believe the decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge against income 
to determine if a decline in the fair value of an investment is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  among others  the period of time and extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than cost  overall market conditions  the historical and projected future financial condition of the issuer of the security and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of the market value 

table of contents valuation of share based awards we account for our share based awards in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic 
we estimate the fair value of our share based stock awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine volatility based on our historical stock price volatility over the most recent period equivalent to the expected life of the award  giving consideration to company specific events impacting our historical volatility that are unlikely to occur in the future  as well as anticipated future events that may impact volatility 
we also consider the historical stock price volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the interest rates on us constant rate treasury securities with contractual terms approximately equal to the expected life of the award 
expected dividend yield 
because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  we assume a dividend yield of zero 
expected award life 
we determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant factors  including the vesting period and contractual term of the award  our employees historical exercise patterns and length of service  the expected future volatility of our stock price and employee characteristics 
we also consider the expected award lives of comparable publicly traded companies 
for stock purchase plan purchase rights  the expected life is equal to the current offering period under the stock purchase plan 
under asc topic  we are also required to estimate at grant the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and to revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on our historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience  giving consideration to company specific events impacting historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience that are unlikely to occur in the future as well as anticipated future events that may impact forfeiture rates 
our determination of the input variables used in the black scholes option pricing model as well as the pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on various underlying estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective and are affected by our stock price  among other factors 
changes in these underlying estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of our share based awards and  therefore  the amount of share based compensation expense to be recognized in our results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc topic 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs 
in such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities 
although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax expense or benefit in the period in which such determination is made 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  we expect that certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or a partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation 
significant judgment is 
table of contents required in evaluating our tax reserves 
our reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of our tax audits 
our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions  if any  and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest and penalties 
favorable resolution of such an income tax matter would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense 
we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in the expected realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
our ability to generate enough taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on many factors  among which are our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies  reversing deferred tax liabilities and any significant changes in the tax treatment received with respect to our business combinations 
since our inception  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not ultimately realize our deferred tax assets 
we adopted the provision of asc topic as it relates to uncertain tax positions effective april  asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc topic requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained

table of contents march  and consist entirely of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans  reduced by payments made to taxing authorities on behalf of our employees when tendering stock to us for settlement of minimum income tax liability upon vesting of restricted stock units 
as of march   we held million in ars at face value  which are collateralized by student loans  most of which were originated under the federal family education loan program and are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
all of our ars are aaa rated or equivalent by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
through february  the face value of our ars has approximated fair value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  all auctions for the ars we hold have failed as the amount of ars submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest at contractually stated rates at each respective auction date  however  the liquidity of the ars will be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars develop 
we have concluded that the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates the face value due to the lack of liquidity 
the ars have been classified within level under asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic 
their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the ars 
we estimated the fair value of our ars utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of march  the analysis considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer  expected future cash flows and the estimated weighted average life of the contractual maturity of the underlying assets 
due to entering into an agreement whereby the investment firm will repurchase our ars at par value  as discussed further below  we no longer intend to hold the securities to maturity and we have determined that the decline in value of our ars as of march  is other than temporary 
accordingly  in fiscal year we reversed prior unrealized losses on our ars from accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded the losses as a charge to income during the same period 
the gain recognized for the change in fair value of the ars was million for the year ended march  on november   we entered into the ars agreement with the investment firm whereby the investment firm has agreed to repurchase all of our ars at par value 
by accepting the ars agreement  we received the right to sell our ars at par value to the investment firm between june  and july  and gave the investment firm the right to purchase the ars from us at any time after the acceptance date as long as we receive par value 
the ars agreement covers ars with a par value of million and a fair value of million as of march  we have accounted for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of asc topic this resulted in our recording a million asset with a corresponding credit to income for the value of the put option 
we estimated the fair value of the put option utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of march  the analysis considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer  expected future cash flows  and the remaining life of the ars agreement with the investment firm 
the combined gain on the ars and put option of million is recorded in the interest and other income  net line in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for year ended march  as we have the right to put our ars to the investment firm beginning june  and we intend to do so  the ars and the put option are classified as current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  we have funded our activities to date primarily through the sales of software licenses and related services and the issuance of equity securities 

table of contents we anticipate that our capital requirements may increase in future periods as a result of seasonal sales trends  additional product development activities and the acquisition of additional equipment 
our capital requirements may also increase in future periods as we seek to expand our technology platform through investments  licensing arrangements  technology alliances or acquisitions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before then 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to continue to generate software sales  the purchase of additional capital equipment and acquisitions of other businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
our forecast for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations should be considered a forward looking statement subject to all of the uncertainties and risks described elsewhere in this report  and actual results could vary 
contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations as of march  are as follows in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases  net of subleases minimum royalty payments total for purposes of the contractual obligations table  we have included indefinite lived contractual minimum royalty payments due in the ten fiscal years following fiscal year we are obligated to pay royalties for licenses to enhance and market certain software used in connection with our product offerings 
in addition to the contractual minimum royalties included in the table above  we have several royalty agreements that are long term or perpetual in nature with royalty obligations that are generally based on a percentage of revenues derived from certain software license sales and associated sales of pcs 
the royalty agreements require quarterly payments and generally do not limit the maximum royalties owed 
during each of the years ended march  and  we incurred royalty expense of million  and during the year ended march   we incurred royalty expense of million 
our future annual royalty obligations will vary based on the volume and mix of our product sales and  as a result  may increase in the future 
on april   in connection with the spin off of pdd  the landlords of our new jersey facilities  which were used by our pdd operations  consented to the assignment of the leases to pdd 
despite the assignment  the landlords required us to guarantee the remaining lease obligations  which totaled approximately million as of march  in accordance with asc topic  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we recognized a liability and corresponding charge to stockholders equity for the probability weighted fair market value of the guarantee 
changes to the fair market value of the liability are recognized in stockholders equity 
the liability for our guarantee of the lease obligation for each of the years as of march  and was million 
off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of march   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued asc  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires additional disclosures for fair value measurements including the following amounts transferred in and out of level and fair value measurements  which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and activities in level fair value measurements including purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of the revised guidance for fair value measurements disclosures will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asc  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance states that if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asc  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
previously  companies that sold tangible products with more than incidental software were required to apply software revenue recognition guidance 
this guidance often delayed revenue recognition for the delivery of the tangible product 
under the new guidance  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will be excluded from the software revenue recognition guidance 
the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what is essential to the functionality of the tangible product 
software enabled products will now be subject to other revenue guidance and will likely follow the guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements issued by the fasb in september the new guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
during the quarter ended september   we adopted asc  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the asc has become the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
the asc is not intended to change or alter existing gaap 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted asc  subsequent events 
this new accounting guidance establishes general standards of accounting for  and requires disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted asc  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  and asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this new accounting guidance as issued by the fasb which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim reporting periods  provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased  provides guidance when a transaction is not deemed an orderly transaction  and provides guidance related to the determination of other than temporary impairments to include the intent and ability of the holder as an indicator in the determination of 
table of contents whether an other than temporary impairment exists 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted asc  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
the new guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of this pronouncement is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under other gaap 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted asc  effective date of fasb statement no 
this new accounting guidance as issued by the fasb delayed the effective date of fair value accounting for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities by one year  except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to our us operations  we have operations in europe and the asia pacific region 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly fluctuations in the pound sterling  euro and yen exchange rates 
many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
these transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
the value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because the receivables and payables may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in currency exchange rates 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables  along with the settlement of certain intercompany transactions  are included in the determination of net income 
we analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to reduce the effect of these potential fluctuations 
we do not currently have hedging contracts in effect since  historically  exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
the majority of our software license agreements are denominated in us dollars 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
none of our investments are held for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to the relatively short maturities of these investments 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our results of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
as of march   we held million in ars at face value  which are collateralized by student loans  most of which were originated under the federal family education loan program and are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
all of our ars are aaa rated or equivalent by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
through february  the face value of our ars has approximated fair value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  all auctions for the ars we hold have failed as the amount of ars submitted for sale has exceeded the 
table of contents amount of purchase orders 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest at contractually stated rates at each respective auction date  however  the liquidity of the ars will be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars develop 
we have concluded that the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates the face value due to the lack of liquidity 
the ars have been classified within level under asc topic their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the ars 
we estimated the fair value of our ars utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of march  the analysis considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer  expected future cash flows and the estimated weighted average life of the contractual maturity of the underlying assets 
due to entering into an agreement whereby the investment firm will repurchase our ars at par value  as discussed further below  we no longer intend to hold the securities to maturity and have determined that the decline in value of our ars as of march  is other than temporary 
accordingly  in fiscal year we reversed prior unrealized losses on our ars from accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded the losses as a charge to income during the same period 
the gain recognized for the change in fair value of the ars was million for the year ended march  on november   we entered into the ars agreement with the investment firm whereby the investment firm agreed to repurchase all of our ars at par value 
by accepting the ars agreement  we received the right to sell our ars at par value to the investment firm between june  and july  and gave the investment firm the right to purchase the ars from us at any time after the acceptance date  as long as we receive par value 
the ars agreement covers ars with a par value of million and a fair value of million as of march  we have accounted for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of asc topic this resulted in our recording a million asset with a corresponding credit to income for the value of the put option 
we estimated the fair value of the put option utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of march  the analysis considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the issuer  expected future cash flows  and the remaining life of the ars agreement with the investment firm 
the combined gain on the ars and put option of million is recorded in the interest and other income  net line in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended march  as we have the right to put our ars to the investment firm beginning june  and we intend to do so  the ars and the put option are classified as current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of march
