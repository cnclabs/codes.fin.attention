item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider significant may also have an adverse effect on us 
if any of the risks below actually occur  our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition could suffer 
our performance may be affected by general economic conditions and the continued global financial difficulties 
our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending  which have deteriorated significantly over the past approximately two years and may remain depressed  or be subject to further deterioration 
some of the factors that are having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions  employment  consumer debt  reductions in net worth based on securities market declines  residential real estate and mortgage markets  taxation  healthcare costs  fuel and energy prices  interest rates  credit availability  consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors 
the worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
apparel retailing is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending 
purchases of specialty apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with the cycles of the levels of disposable income of consumers 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations 
downturns  or the expectation of a downturn  in general economic conditions could adversely affect consumer spending patterns  our sales and our results of operations 
consumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected 
the downturn in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and have an adverse impact on our sales  results of operations and cash flow 
because apparel generally is a discretionary purchase  declines in consumer spending may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than on other retailers 
we may not be profitable if there is a decline in consumer spending 
the turmoil in the financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in security prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability  and there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
tightening of the credit markets and recent or future turmoil in the financial markets could also make it more difficult for us to access funds  to refinance our existing indebtedness if necessary  to enter into agreements for new indebtedness  or to obtain funding through the issuance of our securities 
in addition  the effect from the credit crisis continues to have a significant negative impact on businesses around the world  and the impact of this crisis on our suppliers cannot be predicted 
the inability of suppliers to access liquidity  or the insolvency of suppliers  could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise 
worsening economic conditions could also result in difficulties for financial institutions including bank failures and other parties that we may do business with  which could potentially impair our ability to access financing under existing arrangements or to otherwise recover amounts as they become due under our other contractual arrangements 
additionally  either as a result of or independent of the current financial difficulties and economic weakness in the united states  material fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a negative impact on our business 
our comparable retail sales  comparable store sales and quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future and  as a result  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline substantially 
our comparable retail sales  comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future and are affected by a variety of factors  including the opening of new stores and the success of our leased department and licensed relationships  the timing of new store openings and leased department and licensed brand business openings  the timing of the fulfillment of purchase orders under our product and license arrangements  the extent of cannibalization of sales volume of some of our existing retail locations by our new retail locations opened in the same geographic markets or by our internet sales  changes in our merchandise mix  any repositioning of our brands  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  calendar shifts  including shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  or shifts in the number of weekend days occurring in a given month  changes in pregnancy rates and birth rates  actions of competitors  the level of success and or actions of anchor tenants where we have stores or leased department and licensed relationships  fashion trends  and weather conditions and seasonality 
if  at any time  our comparable retail sales  comparable store sales or quarterly results of operations decline or do not meet the expectations of investors  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our share price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is expected to continue to be  volatile  both because of actual and perceived changes in our financial results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in our share price may include  among other factors discussed in this section  the following actual or anticipated variations in the financial results and prospects of our business or other companies in the retail business  changes in financial estimates by wall street research analysts  actual or anticipated changes in the united states economy or the retailing environment  changes in the market valuations of other specialty apparel or retail companies  announcements by our competitors or us  additions and departures of key personnel  changes in accounting principles  the passage of legislation or other developments affecting us or our industry  the trading volume of our common stock in the public market  changes in economic conditions  financial market conditions  natural disasters  terrorist acts  acts of war or periods of civil unrest  and the realization of some or all of the risks described in this section entitled risk factors 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations from time to time  and the market prices of the equity securities of retailers have been extremely volatile and are sometimes subject to sharp price and trading volume changes 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may not be successful in expanding our business and opening new stores 
any future growth depends significantly on our ability to successfully establish and operate new stores including destination maternity combo stores and superstores and our leased department and licensed relationships on a profitable basis  as well as the success and profitability of our international business  including through franchising relationships 
this growth  if it occurs  will place increased demands on our management  operational and administrative resources 
these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which  in turn  could cause a deterioration in our financial performance and negatively impact our growth 
any planned growth will also require that we continually monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems  as well as our distribution infrastructure 
our ability to establish and operate new stores and our leased department and licensed relationships successfully depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify and obtain suitable store locations  including mall locations  the availability of which is outside of our control  retain existing  expand existing and establish new leased department and licensed relationships  negotiate favorable lease terms for stores  including desired tenant improvement allowances  negotiate favorable lease terminations for existing store locations in markets where we intend to open new destination maternity combo stores or superstores  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores and our leased department and licensed relationships  successfully address competition  merchandising and distribution challenges  and hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified store personnel 
the success and profitability of our international relationships depends on many factors  including  among others the ability of our franchisees to identify and obtain suitable store locations  including mall locations  the availability of which is outside of their control  the ability of our franchisees to negotiate favorable lease terms for stores  including desired tenant improvement allowances  our ability to source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of our franchisees international operations  our ability and the ability of our franchisees to successfully address competition  merchandising and distribution challenges  and the ability of our franchisees to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified store personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business and achieve our goals 
even if we succeed in establishing new stores  further developing our leased department and licensed relationships and further expanding our international relationships  we cannot assure that these initiatives will achieve planned revenue or profitability levels in the time periods estimated by us  or at all 
if any of these initiatives fails to achieve or is unable to sustain acceptable revenue and profitability levels  we may incur significant costs 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by few barriers to entry 
we compete against department stores  specialty retail chains  discount stores  independent retail stores and catalog and internet based retailers 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
further  we do not typically advertise using television and radio media and thus do not reach customers through means our competitors may use 
our mid and luxury priced merchandise faces a highly fragmented competitive landscape that includes locally based  single unit retailers  as well as a handful of multi unit maternity operations  none of which we believe have more than stores nationwide 
in the value priced maternity apparel business  we face competition on a nationwide basis from retailers such as gap  jcpenney  old navy  target and wal mart 
all of these competitors also sell maternity apparel on their websites 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by this competition  including the potential for increased competition in the future 
for example  the maternity apparel business has previously experienced oversupply conditions due to increased competition in the maternity apparel business  which resulted in a greater level of industry wide markdowns and markdowns recognized by us on sales from our retail locations 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will not occur again or worsen 
our relationships with third party retailers may not be successful 
we cannot guarantee successful results from or the continuation of our leased department and licensed relationships with third party retailers such as sears  kmart  macy s  bloomingdales  babies r us  boscov s  gordmans and kohl s 
under our agreement with kohl s  subject to certain notice obligations  kohl s is not obligated to purchase any maternity apparel from us and we are not obligated to sell any maternity apparel to them 
under our agreement with our leased department partners  those partners do not make any promises or representations as to the potential amount of business we can expect from the sale of our product in their stores 
we do not control the pricing terms or the timing or degree of the markdowns at kohl s 
the success of our leased department and licensed brand businesses is highly dependent on the actions and decisions of the third party retailers  which are outside of our control 
the retailers could limit the merchandise carried  close stores  go out of business or terminate their agreements with us 
our failure to properly manage our leased department and licensed brand businesses including any failure by us in timely delivering goods to any third party retailer or any failure to respond to the actions of or changes in business conditions at third party retailers would have a direct impact on the profitability and continuation of these relationships 
we require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness  which reduces the cash available to finance any growth and could adversely affect our financial health 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and we have the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
our ability to make required payments on our indebtedness  as well as to fund our operations and future growth  depends upon our ability to generate cash 
our success in generating cash depends upon the results of our operations  as well as upon general economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to implement our growth strategy  or to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate needs  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates as some of our debt is  and will continue to be  at variable rates of interest  and our available borrowings under our credit facility  to the extent borrowed in the future  would be at variable rates of interest  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  or debt at lower interest rates  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make it more difficult for us to open new stores or improve or expand existing stores  restrict our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  require us to pledge all or substantially all of our assets as collateral to secure indebtedness  and make it more difficult for us to pursue strategic acquisitions  alliances and partnerships 
if we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before the scheduled maturity dates of such debt  sell assets or raise equity 
on such maturity dates  we may need to refinance our indebtedness if our operations do not generate enough cash to pay such indebtedness in full and if we do not raise additional capital 
our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
any borrowings under our credit facility  which could significantly increase in the future  would be at a variable rate 
in addition our term loan  with an outstanding balance of million as of september   bears interest at a variable rate equal to  at our election  either i the prime rate plus  or ii a libor rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin under our term loan was initially fixed at through and including the fiscal quarter ended september  thereafter  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings is either or  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the related term loan agreement 
based upon our applicable quarterly consolidated leverage ratios  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings was prior to december  and has been reduced to effective from december  in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that commenced on april  and expires on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate libor plus prior to december   reduced to libor plus effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios  to a fixed interest rate prior to december   reduced to effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at the inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date 
the notional amount of the swap was million as of september  and over the next eighteen months decreases as follows to million starting october   to million starting april   and to million starting october  regardless of our attempts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the interest rate swap  we still have exposure for the unswapped amounts of the term loan borrowings  which remain subject to a variable interest rate  as well as any borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which would be subject to a variable interest rate 
as a result  an increase in interest rates could result in a substantial increase in interest expense  especially as the swapped amount of the term loan decreases over time and or if our borrowings under our revolving credit facility increase 
we are heavily dependent on our management information systems and our ability to maintain and upgrade these systems from time to time 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our internally developed management information systems 
in particular  we rely on point of sale terminals  which provide information to our customized merchandise analysis and planning system used to track sales and inventory 
the merchandise analysis and planning system helps integrate our design  manufacturing  distribution and financial functions  and also provides daily financial and merchandising information 
although our software programs and data are backed up and securely stored off site  our servers and computer systems are located at our headquarters in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if our servers and systems were inoperable or inaccessible 
from time to time  we improve and upgrade our management information systems 
we have a proprietary  internet based point of sale system 
if we are unable to maintain and upgrade our systems or to integrate new and updated systems in an efficient and timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as an apparel retailer  we rely on numerous third parties in the supply chain to produce and deliver the products that we sell  and our business may be negatively impacted by disruptions in the supply chain 
if we lose the services of one or more of our significant suppliers or one or more of them fail to meet our product needs  we may be unable to obtain replacement merchandise in a timely manner 
if our existing suppliers cannot meet our increased needs and we cannot locate alternative supply sources  we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the most popular items at attractive prices  which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations 
we obtain apparel and other merchandise from foreign sources  both purchased directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
to the extent that any of our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions  could harm our ability to source product 
this disruption could materially limit the merchandise that we would have available for sale and reduce our sales and earnings 
the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability  or war  in or affecting any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured or through which they flow 
trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas  embargos and customs restrictions that are applicable to the products that we sell also could affect the import of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us 
any material increase in tariff levels  or any material decrease in quota levels or available quota allocation  could negatively impact our business 
further  changes in tariffs or quotas for merchandise imported from individual foreign countries could lead us to shift our sources of supply among various countries 
any such shift we undertake in the future could result in a disruption of our sources of supply and or an increase in product costs  and lead to a reduction in our sales and earnings 
supply chain security initiatives undertaken by the united states government that impede the normal flow of product could also negatively impact our business 
in addition  decreases in the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies could increase the cost of products that we purchase from overseas vendors 
we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with relying on vendors that do business in foreign markets and import merchandise from abroad  such as political instability or the threat of terrorism  particularly in countries where our vendors source merchandise  enhanced security measures at united states and foreign ports  which could delay delivery of imports  imposition of new or supplemental duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to the failure of foreign source suppliers to comply with applicable import regulations  delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to organized labor strikes or unexpected or significant port congestion at united states ports  and local business practice and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards  which may result in adverse publicity 
the united states may impose new initiatives that adversely affect the trading status of countries where apparel is manufactured 
these initiatives may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that  if enacted  would increase the cost of products imported from countries where our vendors acquire merchandise 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be materially and adversely affected if our distribution operations were disrupted 
to support our distribution of product throughout the world  we operate our main distribution facility and one significantly smaller distribution facility  both in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
finished garments from contractors and other manufacturers are inspected and stored for distribution to our stores 
we do not have other distribution facilities to support our distribution needs 
if our main philadelphia distribution facility were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products to our stores during the time it takes to reopen or replace this facility 
in light of our strategic emphasis on rapid replenishment as a competitive strength  a distribution disruption might have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operations and profitability relative to other retailers 
in addition  the loss or material disruption of service from any of our shippers for any reason  whether due to freight difficulties  strikes  natural disaster or other difficulties at our principal transport providers or otherwise  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain sufficient raw materials or maintain satisfactory manufacturing arrangements 
we do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on third parties to manufacture our products 
we place our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
we compete with many other companies for production facilities and raw materials 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards or environmental standards 
we have no ability to control the environmental compliance including compliance with climate change requirements of these third party manufacturers 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with these third parties  or if we cannot obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in commodity prices could result in an increase in component costs and or delivery costs 
the results of our business operations could suffer due to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities  including but not limited to cotton  wool and other ingredients used in the production of fabric and accessories  as well as fuel  oil and natural gas 
increases in prices of these commodities or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials and product components  as well as increases in the cost of distributing merchandise to our retail locations and shipping products to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to offset any such increased costs through value engineering and similar initiatives  or through price increases  our profitability  cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted 
if we choose to increase prices to offset the increased costs  our unit sales volumes could be adversely impacted 
our stores are heavily dependent on the customer traffic generated by shopping malls 
we depend heavily on locating our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls in order to generate customer traffic 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls or the success of existing or new mall stores 
the success of all of our mall stores will depend  in part  on the ability of each mall s anchor tenants  such as large department stores  other tenants and area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores  and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations 
many traditional enclosed malls are experiencing significantly lower levels of customer traffic than in the past  driven by overall poor economic conditions as well as the closure of certain mall anchor tenants 
sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area  the closing of anchor tenants or competition from non mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores 
our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to fashion trends 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success depends on the priority that our target customers place on fashion and our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
our ability or our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or trends could lead to  among other things  excess inventories and higher markdowns  as well as the decreased appeal of our brands 
particular fashion trends  or an inaccuracy of our forecasts regarding fashion trends  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in fiscal we were negatively impacted from the popularity of certain styles in the non maternity women s apparel market  such as trapeze and baby doll dresses and tops  which can more readily fit a pregnant woman early in her pregnancy than typical non maternity fashions 
the failure to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified senior management personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores 
this execution requires experienced and talented management 
we currently have a management team with a great deal of experience with us and in apparel retailing 
if we were to lose the benefit of this experience  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
on september   rebecca matthias  our co founder  retired from the company 
under her transition agreement  ms 
matthias is available to provide consulting services to us  as requested  through september  if we were unable to compensate for the loss of the benefit of ms 
matthias experience  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  as our business expands  we believe that our success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there is a high level of competition for personnel in the retail industry 
like most retailers  we experience significant employee turnover rates  particularly among store sales associates and managers  and our continued growth will require us to hire and train even more new personnel 
we therefore must continually attract  hire and train new personnel to meet our staffing needs 
we constantly compete for qualified personnel with companies in our industry and in other industries 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity 
if we are unable to retain our employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other skilled personnel in the future  we may not be able to service our customers as effectively  which could impair our ability to increase sales and could otherwise harm our business 
our quarterly operating results and inventory levels may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality in our business 
our business  like that of other retailers  is seasonal 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon  among other things  increases or decreases in comparable retail sales or comparable store sales  the timing of new store openings and new leased department openings  net sales and profitability contributed by new stores and leased departments  the timing of the fulfillment of purchase orders under our product and license arrangements  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and promotions  changes in inventory and production levels and the timing of deliveries of inventory  and changes in our merchandise mix 
our quarterly net sales have historically been highest in our third fiscal quarter  corresponding to the spring selling season  followed by our first fiscal quarter  corresponding to the fall holiday selling season 
given the historically higher sales level in our third fiscal quarter and the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses and interest expense  we have typically generated a very significant percentage of our full year operating income and net income during our third fiscal quarter 
thus  any factors which result in a material reduction of our sales for the third quarter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for our fiscal year as a whole 
seasonal fluctuations in sales also affect our inventory levels  as we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially before the fall holiday and spring selling seasons 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory during this period  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to sell the excess inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on sustained demand for maternity clothing and is sensitive to birth rates  women s fashion trends  economic conditions and consumer spending 
our business depends upon sustained demand for maternity clothing 
our future performance will be subject to a number of factors beyond our control  including demographic changes  fashion trends  economic conditions and consumer spending 
if demand for maternity clothing were to decline for any reason  such as a decrease in the number of pregnancies  our operating results could be adversely affected 
for example  according to the united states census bureau and united states centers for disease control and prevention  births declined in calendar compared to calendar  and declined in calendar compared to calendar if this trend were to continue it could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  our operating results could be adversely affected if certain non maternity women s apparel fashions have a more pregnancy friendly fit 
for example  in fiscal  we were negatively impacted by the popularity of certain styles in the non maternity women s apparel market  such as trapeze and baby doll dresses and tops  which can more readily fit a pregnant woman early in her pregnancy than typical non maternity fashions 
downturns  or the expectation of a downturn  in general economic conditions could adversely affect consumer spending patterns  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the specialty apparel retail business historically has been subject to cyclical variations 
consumer purchases of specialty apparel products  including maternity wear  may decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower 
declines in consumer spending patterns may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than some other retailers 
therefore  we may not be able to maintain our historical sales and earnings  or remain as profitable  if there is a decline in consumer spending patterns 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or is accused of violating any such laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we maintain policies and guidelines with respect to labor practices that independent manufacturers that produce goods for us are contractually required to follow  and while we have an independent firm and company employees inspect certain manufacturing sites to monitor compliance  we cannot control the actions of such manufacturers or the public s perceptions of them  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices 
apparel companies can be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products 
while many of our independent manufacturers are routinely monitored by buying representatives  who assist us in the areas of compliance  garment quality and delivery  we do not control the manufacturers business practices or their employees employment conditions  and manufacturers act in their own interest which may be in a manner that results in negative public perceptions of us  and or employee allegations against us  or court determinations that we are jointly liable 
violations of law by our importers  buying agents  manufacturers or distributors could result in delays in shipments and receipt of goods and could subject us to fines or other penalties  any of which could restrict our business activities  increase our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property and may be subject to liability if we are alleged to have infringed on another party s intellectual property 
we believe that our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property 
although we actively protect our intellectual property  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property  including our rights in our management information systems and our proprietary rights in products for which we have applied for or received patent protection for example  our secret fit belly innovation  will be adequate to prevent imitation of our marks  products or services by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks  service marks or other proprietary rights 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks and other proprietary rights or may allege that we have or are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our trademarks and proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that these registrations will prevent imitation of our name  merchandising concept  store design or private label merchandise  or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others 
imitation of our name  concept  store design or merchandise in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the high expense in both prosecuting and defending against  and potential liability related to  alleged infringements of intellectual property rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if climate change laws or regulations were to become applicable to our business  or if any third party with whom we have a leased or licensed relationship imposed reporting or other obligations on us due to their own compliance programs  we could incur additional expense to meet the requirements and our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business 
with respect to manufacturing within the united states  united states environmental protection agency epa greenhouse gas ghg emission reporting rules require certain united states manufacturers to report ghg emissions 
these rules are unlikely to require reporting of our third party contract apparel manufacturers because the amount of emissions from retail stores and apparel manufacturing facilities are currently estimated to be below the epa reporting threshold 
with respect to manufacturing outside of the united states  international treaties  such as the kyoto protocol and the copenhagen protocol  do not currently require the countries in which our non united states contract apparel manufacturers are located to control ghg emissions and it is unlikely that climate change requirements in the foreseeable future will require significant ghg emission reductions on our non united states contract apparel manufacturers 
our manufacturers are required to follow all applicable laws  including climate change laws 
if domestic or international laws or regulations were expanded to require ghg emission reporting or reduction by us or our third party contract apparel manufacturers  or if we engage third party contract manufacturers in countries that have existing ghg emission reporting or reduction laws or regulations  we would need to expend financial and other resources to comply with such regulations and or monitor our third party contract apparel manufacturers compliance with such regulations 
in addition  we cannot control the actions of our third party manufacturers or the public s perceptions of them  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using climate change proactive or sustainable practices 
violations of climate change laws or regulations by third parties with whom we do business could result in negative public perception of us and or delays in shipments and receipt of goods  and could subject us to fines or other penalties  any of which could restrict our business activities  increase our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline 
some retailers have adopted sustainability or other policies that encourage or require suppliers to report and or reduce ghg emissions 
no third party with whom we have a leased or licensed relationship currently requires us to report ghg emissions to them 
however  we expect that certain of these third parties may do so in the future  which would require us to expend financial and other resources to comply with such requirements 
in addition  if such requirements are imposed on us  our relationship with such third parties could be damaged if we were unable to comply 
war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism  or if either is threatened  our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale may be negatively affected 
a substantial portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be adversely affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our main distribution facility and retail locations  as well as fulfilling internet orders 
the terms of our debt instruments impose financial and operating restrictions 
our credit facility and term loan agreements each contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
these covenants limit or restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of our equity securities  or purchase or redeem capital stock  or make certain investments  have our subsidiaries pay dividends  make loans or transfer assets to us  sell assets  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries  enter into any transactions with our affiliates  transfer any capital stock of any subsidiary or permit any subsidiary to issue capital stock  create liens  enter into certain sale leaseback transactions  and effect a consolidation or merger or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets 
these limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests 
in addition  our ability to borrow under the credit facility is subject to borrowing base requirements 
if we breach any of the covenants in our credit facility or term loan agreements  we may be in default under our credit facility and or our term loan 
if we default  the lenders under our term loan or the lender under our credit facility could declare all borrowings owed to them  including accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable 
our charter documents contain certain anti takeover provisions  and we are entitled to certain other protective provisions under delaware law 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of the company  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill  that entitles our stockholders to acquire additional shares of us  or a potential acquirer of us  at a substantial discount to their market value in the event of an attempted takeover 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable by  among other things authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the discretion of our board of directors  restricting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings 
these provisions may also reduce the market value of our common stock 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of each of our credit facility and term loan agreements restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock 
even if our ability to pay dividends were not restricted  any future payment of dividends would still be at the discretion of our board of directors and would be based upon any applicable restrictive financial covenants  earnings  capital requirements and our financial condition  among other factors  at the time any such dividend is considered 
any increase in our sales and marketing efforts that target markets outside the united states and canada would expose us to additional risks associated with international operations 
although an immaterial amount of our sales are currently derived from international sales outside of canada  we are actively seeking to expand our international presence  and we have begun to do so through franchise arrangements in the middle east and india 
we may not be successful in these efforts 
international operations and sales subject us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states 
for example  we may depend on third parties to market our products through foreign sales channels  and we may be challenged by laws and business practices favoring local competitors 
in addition  our ability to succeed in foreign markets will depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we must also adapt our pricing structure to address different pricing environments and may face difficulty in enforcing revenue collection internationally 
emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy 
the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks 
deterioration of social  political  labor  or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results or those of our franchisees 
operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws  policies and measures  and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments 
to the extent we achieve significant sales outside of the united states in the future  we may have significant exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we could have failures in our system of internal controls 
we maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and monitored by management  who meet regularly with our audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe we have a well designed system to maintain adequate internal controls on the business 
we cannot assure you that there will not be any control deficiencies in the future 
should we become aware of any control deficiencies  we would report them to the audit committee and recommend prompt remediation 
we have devoted significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing fraud 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations

item properties we own our principal executive offices and distribution facility  which is located at north fifth street  philadelphia  pennsylvania  subject to a mortgage under the terms of which we owe approximately million as of september  this facility consists of approximately  square feet  of which approximately  square feet is dedicated to office space and the remaining square footage is used for finished goods warehousing and distribution

the area leased at this facility  which we use for some finished goods warehousing and distribution  raw material cutting and warehousing  and office space consists of approximately  square feet of space  of which  square feet is dedicated to office space 
beginning in and continuing through fiscal  we leased approximately  square feet of finished goods warehouse and distribution space in mississauga  ontario in canada 
for fiscal and the forseeable future  we plan to distribute product to our canadian stores from our distribution facility in philadelphia  pennsylvania and  accordingly we allowed our canada lease to expire on october  from time to time we may also utilize third party warehousing services in the philadelphia  pennsylvania area when we have increased storage requirements 
these services essentially operate on a month to month basis 
we believe that these facilities will be adequate to support our anticipated distribution needs for the near term and  potentially  longer 
in the event we need additional space to meet our future distribution needs  we believe that such space would be readily available 
our facilities are subject to state and local regulations that range from building codes to health and safety regulations 
we lease our store premises for initial terms averaging from five to ten years 
certain leases allow us to terminate or reduce our obligations at specified points in time in the event that the applicable store does not achieve a specified sales volume 
some of our store leases also provide for contingent payments based on sales volume  escalations of the base rent  as well as increases in operating costs  marketing costs and real estate taxes 
as of september   the following numbers of store leases are set to expire as listed in the table below 
we do not expect the expiration of any leases to have a material adverse impact on our business or operations 
fiscal year leases expire number of stores and later total in addition to the stores we operate  we have arrangements with department and specialty stores  including sears  kmart  macy s  bloomingdale s  babies r us  boscov s and gordmans to operate maternity apparel departments in their stores 
these leased departments typically involve the lease partner collecting all of the revenue from the leased department 
the revenue is remitted to us  less a fixed percentage of the net sales earned by the lease partner as stipulated in the agreement 
we provide at least some amount of staffing for each of the leased departments  with the amount varying depending on the specific arrangement 
generally  under each of our leased department agreements  our lease partner has the right to terminate any or all of our rights to operate our leased departments in their stores subject to varying notice requirements 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and although the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to currently pending actions cannot be accurately predicted  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending action will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity

during fiscal  we prepaid million principal amount of our outstanding term loan  which resulted in pretax charges totaling million 
income taxes 
our income tax provision for fiscal was million 
there was no tax benefit associated with our million of goodwill impairment charges 
before the goodwill impairment charges  our income before income taxes was million and our effective tax rate was a provision of for fiscal compared to a benefit of in fiscal our income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal reflect the effect of additional income tax expense including interest and penalties recognized as required by the accounting standard for uncertain income tax positions 
additionally  our income tax rates for both fiscal and fiscal reflect the effects of certain minimum state tax requirements  partially offset by allowable federal tax credits 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for the reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate 
net loss 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per share diluted  compared to net loss of million for fiscal  or per share diluted 
net loss for fiscal includes net of tax the goodwill impairment charges of million  restructuring and other charges of million  stock compensation expense of approximately million and loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
net loss for fiscal includes net of tax restructuring and other charges of million  stock compensation expense of million and loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
before the goodwill impairment expense  restructuring and other charges  stock compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt  our net income was million or per share diluted  compared to million or per share diluted for fiscal our average shares outstanding basic and diluted of  shares for fiscal was higher than the  average shares outstanding basic and diluted for fiscal the increase in average shares outstanding reflects higher shares outstanding in fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of vesting of restricted stock awards and stock option exercises 
there is no difference between basic and diluted shares outstanding for both fiscal and fiscal  as a result of the elimination of the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and restricted stock  due to the net loss in both fiscal and fiscal had we reported a profit for fiscal and fiscal  the weighted average number of dilutive shares outstanding for computation of diluted eps would have been approximately  and  respectively 
following is a reconciliation of net loss and net loss per share diluted to net income and net income per share diluted before goodwill impairment expense  restructuring and other charges  stock compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt for the years ended september  and in thousands  except per share amounts year ended september  year ended september  net income loss shares eps net income loss shares eps as reported goodwill impairment expense  net of tax restructuring and other charges  net of tax stock compensation expense  net of tax loss on extinguishment of debt  net of tax incremental shares from the assumed lapse of restrictions on restricted stock awards incremental shares from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options as adjusted before goodwill impairment expense  restructuring and other charges  stock compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt restructuring and other charges on july   we announced that we were streamlining our merchandise brands and store nameplates and implementing cost reductions in order to simplify our business model  reduce overhead costs and improve and tighten our merchandise assortments 
pursuant to the strategic restructuring  we rebranded our mimi maternity merchandise brand under our a pea in the pod brand beginning with the spring collection  which initially debuted in november we also streamlined our store nameplates  which began in november  by renaming our single brand mimi maternity stores as a pea in the pod  and by renaming our multi brand mimi maternity stores as destination maternity 
in connection with the strategic restructuring we also reduced our corporate and field management headcount  and during fiscal and fiscal we implemented actions to achieve further cost reductions 
the objectives of our restructuring and cost reduction program are to improve and simplify critical processes  consolidate activities and infrastructure  and reduce our expense structure 
we have substantially completed the planned activities of the initiatives and incurred approximately million of pretax expense substantially related to these initiatives in fiscal  primarily for consulting services 
we incurred pretax expense of approximately million from our restructuring and cost reduction actions in fiscal  consisting of approximately million for consulting services related to our cost reduction initiatives  million for cash severance expense and severance related benefits  and approximately million of non cash expense for accelerated depreciation of existing store signs resulting from planned store signage changes 
these initiatives resulted in approximate pretax savings of million in fiscal  with incremental pretax savings of approximately million in fiscal we project total annualized pretax savings of approximately to million in fiscal as a result of our cost reduction initiatives  which includes the savings realized in fiscal plus the incremental savings in fiscal in connection with the retirement of dan matthias  our former chief executive officer former ceo  effective september   we recognized pretax expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge reflects benefit costs and payroll taxes related to an amendment to the executive s supplemental retirement agreement with us 
subsequent to his retirement  our former ceo continued to serve us as non executive chairman of the board and is available to our ceo in a consulting capacity  for which our former ceo is being paid an annual retainer of  through september in november  our former ceo entered into a letter agreement with us  which confirmed that he would not seek reelection to the board of directors after the expiration of his term in january the agreement does not change the terms of payment under his annual retainer for advisory services  however we incurred a pretax charge of approximately million in fiscal  representing the amount due for the remaining term of the advisory arrangement 
in connection with the retirement of rebecca matthias  our former president and chief creative officer  at the end of fiscal  we incurred a pretax charge of approximately million in fiscal the charge reflects benefit costs related to an amendment to the executive s supplemental retirement agreement with us 
in connection with the may hiring  and subsequent august resignation  of a candidate as our new president  we incurred pretax charges of approximately million in fiscal  primarily related to executive recruiting costs 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs have primarily been for i debt service  including prepayments  ii capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment for new stores  store relocations and expansions of our existing stores  as well as improvements and new equipment for our distribution and corporate facilities and information systems  and iii working capital  including inventory to support our business 
we have historically financed these capital requirements from cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities or available cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal compared to an increase of million during fiscal cash provided by operations of million for fiscal decreased by approximately million from million for fiscal this decrease in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was primarily the result of working capital changes that used cash in fiscal compared to providing a significant amount of cash in fiscal  partially offset by higher net income in fiscal compared to net income before non cash goodwill impairment expense in fiscal the working capital changes were primarily i a modest increase in inventories in fiscal  primarily related to the expansion into additional sears and kmart leased department locations  versus a significant decrease in inventories in fiscal  which reflected our efforts to reduce our inventory levels in fiscal  ii an increase in trade receivables in fiscal compared to the slight fiscal decrease  which primarily reflects timing of collections for licensed relationship sales and iii an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal  compared to a decrease in fiscal  which primarily reflects higher tenant improvement allowances due from landlords in fiscal and the receipt in fiscal of a million federal income tax refund 
during fiscal we used cash provided by operations primarily to fund repayments of long term debt and to pay for capital expenditures 
our repayments of long term debt in fiscal consisted predominately of million of prepayments of our term loan  including a million prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan 
for fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment principally for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our information systems and distribution and corporate facilities 
cash provided by operations of million for fiscal increased by million from million for fiscal this increase in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was primarily the result of the net income before non cash goodwill impairment charges in fiscal as compared with a net loss in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  working capital changes that provided more cash in fiscal compared to fiscal the working capital changes were primarily i a slight increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current and non current liabilities in fiscal compared to a significant decrease in fiscal  and ii a decrease in other current assets in fiscal  which primarily reflected the receipt of a million federal income tax refund  partially offset by iii a slight decrease in trade accounts receivable in fiscal compared to a much larger decrease in fiscal  and iv a smaller decrease in inventories in fiscal compared to the fiscal decrease 
during fiscal we used cash provided by operations primarily to fund repayments of long term debt and to pay for capital expenditures 
our repayments of long term debt in fiscal consisted predominately of million of prepayments of our term loan  including a million prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan 
for fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment principally for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our information systems and distribution and corporate facilities 
we have in place an agreement the term loan agreement for a senior secured term loan b  which matures on march  the term loan  the proceeds of which were used to redeem the remaining principal amount of our then outstanding senior notes in april the interest rate on the term loan is equal to  at our election  either i the prime rate plus  or ii a libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin was initially fixed at through and including the fiscal quarter ended september  thereafter  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings is either or  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the term loan agreement 
based upon our applicable quarterly consolidated leverage ratios  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings was prior to december  and has been reduced to effective from december  we are required to make minimum repayments of the principal amount of the term loan in quarterly installments of  each 
we are also required to make an annual principal repayment equal to or of excess cash flow as defined in the term loan agreement in excess of million for each fiscal year  with the or factor depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the effect of any non cash goodwill impairment charges is excluded from the calculation of excess cash flow under our term loan agreement 
the required principal repayment for fiscal  which was calculated based on the factor  is million and is due in december the required principal repayment for fiscal  which was calculated based on the factor  was million and was paid in december additionally  the term loan can be prepaid at our option  in part or in whole  at any time without any prepayment premium or penalty 
for fiscal we made the following prepayments million in the first quarter  including a million prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan  and million in the third quarter 
for fiscal we made the following prepayments million in the first quarter  including a million prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
at september   our indebtedness under the term loan agreement was million 
the term loan is secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory  real estate interests  letter of credit rights  cash  intangibles and certain other assets 
the security interest granted to the term loan lenders is  in certain respects  subordinate to the security interest granted to the credit facility lender 
the term loan agreement imposes certain restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and enter into other various types of transactions 
the term loan agreement also contains quarterly financial covenants that require us to maintain a specified maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio and a specified minimum permitted consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the term loan agreement 
since the inception of the term loan agreement we have been in compliance with all covenants of our term loan agreement 
in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the agent bank for the term loan that commenced on april   the date the term loan proceeds were received  and expires on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate libor plus prior to december   reduced to libor plus effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios  to a fixed interest rate prior to december   reduced to effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at the inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date april  
the notional amount of the swap was million as of september  and over the next eighteen months decreases as follows to million starting october   to million starting april   and to million starting october  we also have in place a million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which matures on march  there are no financial covenant requirements under the credit facility provided that excess availability as defined in the related credit facility agreement does not fall below of the borrowing base as defined in the related credit facility agreement 
if excess availability were to fall below of the borrowing base  we would be required to meet a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the related credit facility agreement 
during all of fiscal and fiscal  we exceeded the minimum requirements for excess availability under the credit facility 
as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our credit line based on our borrowing base formula  compared to no outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our credit line as of september  borrowings under the credit facility as of september  would have borne interest at a rate of between approximately and per annum 
during fiscal and  our average level of direct borrowings under the credit facility was million and million  respectively  and our maximum borrowings at any time were million and million  respectively 
we may have borrowings under our credit facility during certain periods of fiscal  reflecting seasonal and other timing variations in cash flow 
we have million outstanding under an industrial revenue bond irb at september  the irb has a variable interest rate that may be converted to a fixed interest rate at our option 
at any time prior to conversion to a fixed interest rate structure  bondholders may put all or part of the irb back to us upon notice to the bond trustee  after which the remarketing agent would attempt to resell the put portion of the irb 
if the remarketing agent is unsuccessful in reselling the put portion of the irb  the bond trustee may then draw on a letter of credit issued under the credit facility to repay the bondholders 
we are unaware of any intention on the part of any bondholder to put all or any part of the irb  and the letter of credit issued to secure the bonds has never been drawn upon 
in the event that the bondholders put the bonds back to us and the remarketing agent fails to resell the bonds  which we believe is unlikely  we expect the acceleration of the payment of the bonds would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
in march  we entered into the supplemental executive retirement agreements the serp agreements with dan and rebecca matthias the serp executives 
in may  we entered into i a letter agreement with the serp executives and the trustee the trustee for a grantor trust  which was established for the purpose of accumulating assets in anticipation of our payment obligations under the serp agreements the grantor trust  and ii an amendment to the grantor trust agreement with the trustee collectively the agreements 
the agreements amended the serp agreements and the grantor trust agreement to allow us to deliver an irrevocable standby letter of credit to the trustee the serp letter of credit in an amount equal to our then current funding obligation under the serp agreements  which was million as of may  the amendments affected by the agreements also allow for the issuance  from time to time  of serp letters of credit  or the increase of size of a serp letter of credit already held by the trustee  in lieu of any deposit to the grantor trust otherwise required in the future 
in addition  the agreements permit us  from time to time at our sole discretion  to reduce the size of any serp letter of credit issued to the trustee  so long as we contemporaneously fund the grantor trust with an amount of cash equal to the amount of the reduction of the serp letter of credit 
in october  we increased the serp letter of credit issued to the trustee to a total of million  in lieu of deposits to the grantor trust  in connection with additional vesting of the serp executives benefits 
in fiscal  we reduced the serp letter of credit by million to a total of million  in connection with serp benefit payments 
in fiscal  we increased the serp letter of credit by approximately million  in connection with additional vesting of the serp executives benefits  and we reduced the serp letter of credit by million  in connection with serp benefit payments 
in december  in connection with the additional vesting and scheduled payment of serp executives benefits in  we made a partial cash contribution to the grantor trust of million  and contemporaneously reduced the serp letter of credit by million 
as of september   the serp letter of credit was a total of million 
in october  we reduced the serp letter of credit by million to a total of million  in connection with an october serp benefit payment 
pursuant to a transition agreement with one of the serp executives  we will make a lump sum serp benefit payment of million in december our management believes that our current cash and working capital positions  expected operating cash flows and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and debt repayment requirements and to fund stock repurchases and or debt repayments  if any  for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources 
the tables below set forth a summary of these obligations and commitments as of september  in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period description total obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years long term debt interest related to long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the amounts in this table exclude obligations under employment and retirement agreements 
for a discussion of the compensation of our executive officers  see the information contained under the caption executive compensation in our proxy statement  which will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders expected to be held in the second quarter of fiscal interest costs on our floating rate long term debt were estimated using the interest rates in effect as of september  this presentation of interest costs on our floating rate long term debt includes the effect of our interest rate swap agreement further described above in liquidity and capital resources 
includes store operating leases  which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent 
the amounts reflected include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs 
our purchase orders with contract manufacturers are cancelable by us at any time prior to our acceptance of the merchandise 
excludes purchase orders for supplies in the normal course of business 
commercial commitments description total obligations amount of commitment per period less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years credit facility other standby letters of credit total commercial commitments consists of outstanding letter of credit commitments under our credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  future reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and the related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories 
we value our inventories  which consist primarily of maternity apparel  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method fifo and includes the cost of merchandise  freight  duty and broker fees  as well as applied product related overhead 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly valued at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current analysis of merchandise based on receipt date  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria utilized by us to determine the net realizable value of our inventories and the related level of required inventory reserves include factors such as the amount of merchandise received within the past twelve months  merchandise received more than one year before with quantities on hand in excess of twelve months of sales  and merchandise currently selling below cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if required 
inventories as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of inventories to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment included in the property  plant and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and  to a much lesser extent  patent and lease acquisition costs included in the other intangible assets  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets 
these long lived assets are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life 
net long lived assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate the historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as i store type  that is  company store or leased department  ii store concept  that is  motherhood  pea or destination maternity  iii store location  for example  urban area versus suburb  iv current marketplace awareness of our brands  v local customer demographic data  vi anchor stores within the mall in which our store is located and vii current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which is assumed to be within two years from the date a store location is opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
as a result of our impairment assessment  we recorded write downs of long lived assets of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
self insurance reserves 
we are primarily self insured for most workers compensation claims  general liability and automotive liability losses  and for healthcare claims 
we have purchased insurance coverage in order to establish certain limits to our exposure on a per claim basis and on an aggregate basis 
self insurance reserves as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively 
the estimated reserves for our self insured liabilities and our reported operating results could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from the factors noted below 
we determine the estimated reserve required for workers compensation claims  general liability and automotive liability losses in each accounting period 
this requires that we determine estimates of the costs of claims incurred including claims incurred but not yet reported and accrue for such expenses in the period in which the claims are incurred including claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual workers compensation claims  and general liability and automotive liability losses  are reported to us by third party administrators 
the third party administrators also report initial estimates of related loss reserves 
the open claims and initial loss reserves and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported are subjected to examination by us utilizing a consistent methodology which involves various assumptions  judgment and other factors 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the probability of settlement  the amount at which settlement can be achieved  the probable duration of the claim  the cost development pattern of the claim and the applicable cost development factor 
in addition  we utilize a cooperative arrangement with a number of other companies to assist in managing these insurance risks for certain occurrences prior to march  based on this arrangement  our expenses could be impacted by the loss history associated with the cooperative as a whole for the years for which we remain a participant 
the liabilities associated with claims for workers compensation  general liability and automotive liability are measured through the use of actuarial methods to project an estimate of ultimate cost for claims incurred 
the healthcare plans available to our employees are also primarily self insured 
we record an accrual for the estimated amount of self insured healthcare claims incurred but not yet reported using an actuarial method that applies a development factor to the reported claims amount 
the most significant factors that impact the determination of the required accrual are medical cost trends and inflation  employer employee cost sharing factors  changes in plan benefits  and the historical timing of claims processing 
we continually monitor historical experience and cost trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure including interest and penalties together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish reserves for certain tax positions that we believe are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal  state and foreign tax laws and regulations currently in effect  some of which have been recently revised 
legislation changes by the states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material and adverse effect on our net income or cash flow 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
net deferred tax assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing of total assets at september  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
accounting for contingencies 
from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with applicable accounting standards  which require us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management  after consultation with outside legal counsel  to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 receivables topic disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
asu no 
requires enhanced disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  including uncollectible trade accounts receivable 
asu no 
is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the adoption of the new disclosure requirements of asu no 
is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued staff position fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities

fsp eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
the adoption of fsp eitf did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or reported earnings per share 
inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in the united states in recent years have had a significant effect on our net sales or profitability 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk destination maternity corporation is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
the range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
as of september   we had cash equivalents of million and million of investments in a grantor trust 
our cash equivalents and investments in the grantor trust consist of money market accounts that bear interest at variable rates 
a change in market interest rates earned on our investments impacts the interest income and cash flows  but does not materially impact the fair market value of the financial instruments 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
the impact on our future interest income resulting from changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio at that time 
however  based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience  we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income 
as of september   the principal components of our debt portfolio were the million term loan and the million credit facility  both of which are denominated in united states dollars 
our credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices 
as of september   we had no direct borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility would have resulted in interest at a rate between approximately and per annum as of september  any future borrowings under the credit facility would  to the extent of outstanding borrowings  be affected by changes in market interest rates 
a change in market interest rates on the variable rate portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest expense incurred and cash flows 
the term loan carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices 
the sensitivity analysis as it relates to this portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels as of september   with all other variables held constant 
the principal amount of the term loan was million as of september  a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense on the term loan of approximately million 
a basis point decline in market interest rates would correspondingly lower our annual interest expense on the term loan by approximately million 
in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the agent bank for the term loan that commenced on april  the interest rate swap agreement enables us to effectively convert an amount of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate libor plus prior to december   reduced to libor plus effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios  to a fixed interest rate prior to december   reduced to effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at inception of the swap agreement and decreases over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date april  
the notional amount of the swap was million as of september  and over the next twelve months decreases as follows to million starting october   and to million starting april  based on the scheduled swap notional amount during the next months of the swap agreement  a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in interest expense savings for the year of approximately million related to the swap agreement 
a basis point decline in market interest rates would correspondingly increase our interest expense for the year by approximately million related to the swap agreement 
thus  a basis point increase in market interest rates during the next months of the swap agreement would result in additional interest expense for the year of approximately million on the term loan and swap agreement combined 
a basis point decline in market interest rates during the next months of the swap agreement would correspondingly lower our interest expense for the year by approximately million on the term loan and swap agreement combined 
based on the limited other variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of september   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in additional interest incurred for the year of less than million 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would correspondingly lower our interest expense for the year by less than million 
other than as described above  we do not believe that the market risk exposure on other financial instruments is material
