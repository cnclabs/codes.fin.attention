item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance analog power ics  mixed signal and digital ics 
these products address a wide range of end markets including cellular handsets  enterprise and portable computing  enterprise and home networking  wide area and metropolitan area networks and industrial equipment 
the company also manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services for customers who produce electronic systems for communications  consumer and military applications 
to enhance the readers understanding of the company s performance  the following chronological overview of the company s results for the years through have been provided 
during the first quarter of  bookings increased in all major geographic regions resulting in an growth in orders compared with fourth quarter levels 
the total overall amount of new orders booked in the first quarter exceeded revenues 
the sequential improvement in bookings was driven by higher order levels from customers serving the high speed communications  wireless handset and industrial end markets 
first quarter revenues were million  less than the million recorded in the fourth quarter and lower than the million posted in the first quarter of seasonal declines in sales to customers serving the computing  wireless handset and consumer end markets were partially offset by higher resales through the company s sell through distributors 
gross margin increased sequentially to despite lower revenues and inventory reduction due to a combination of lower manufacturing costs and a higher gross margin sales mix 
first quarter operating profit was million  or of sales 
the company s on hand inventory declined on a sequential basis 
overall channel inventories remained relatively flat from the end of  with increases at the company s sell through distributors offset by lower inventory levels at micrel s sell in distributors 
in the second quarter of  bookings exceeded the company s revenue level 
second quarter revenues were million  a sequential increase of over the million recorded in the first quarter  and lower than the million posted in the year ago period 
the sequential growth in second quarter revenues was led by increased sales to customers serving the communications and computing end markets  offsetting lower sales of the company s products to major korean wireless handset customers 
gross margin of increased from the prior year period and decreased by from the first quarter 
during the second quarter  the company operated at a lower level of factory utilization  which had the combined effect of reducing both inventory levels and gross margin 
channel inventories also declined on a sequential basis as the company s major global sell through distributors attempted to take advantage of readily available semiconductor component supplies to increase their working capital turns 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued demand for the company s products in the third quarter of was generally seasonal in nature 
bookings from industrial and wireline communication customers softened  while holiday and back to school related markets such as wireless handsets  computing and consumer were more robust 
faced with concerns about the growth of the us economy  the company s sell through distributors were cautious throughout the third quarter as they saw their orders slow and inventories build 
the overall amount of orders booked by the company in the third quarter was approximately the same as the revenue level for the quarter 
third quarter revenues were million  up slightly compared to the second quarter  and lower than the million posted in the year ago period 
an increase in third quarter sales to customers in the wireless handset and consumer end market was offset by lower revenues from customers in the wireline communications end market  arising from lower shipments to major chinese communications customers as they trimmed inventory levels 
gross margin decreased from in the second quarter to in the third quarter of  and decreased from in the year ago period 
during the third quarter  the company reduced on hand inventory levels despite a higher level of factory utilization 
channel inventories increased by approximately one week over the second quarter due to seasonally slower distribution sales of the company s products 
third quarter operating profit was million  or of revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment appeared to heighten the company s customer s focus on maintaining lean inventories 
global distributors and certain oem customers informed the company that they attempted to minimize inventory at year end 
as a consequence  customer orders and purchases declined more quickly than usual in the month of december  resulting in a quarterly book to bill ratio of less than one  and impacting fourth quarter revenues 
revenues for the fourth quarter of decreased from the third quarter to million and were essentially flat to the revenues in the year ago period 
sales to customers serving the consumer  computing and the wire line communications end markets declined on a sequential basis  partially offset by increased sales of the company s ethernet products during the quarter 
gross margin decreased to in the fourth quarter from in the third quarter primarily as a result of a less favorable sales mix 
fourth quarter operating profit was million  or of revenues 
on hand inventories increased during the fourth quarter  while channel inventories decreased by approximately one week from the end of the third quarter 
micrel s financial performance in remained solid 
total year gross margin of was the second highest in the company history 
net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in included in pre tax income was a million gain associated with a first quarter legal settlement  which after income taxes  was equivalent to million or per diluted share 
cash flows from operations of million during the year enabled the repurchase of million shares of common stock for million  representing approximately of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year 
in addition  the company commenced a per common share cash dividend payment to shareholders in the second quarter of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in the first quarter of  bookings levels rebounded from the fourth quarter of  resulting in the highest quarterly booking level since the first quarter of and a book to bill ratio significantly above one 
first quarter revenues of million increased sequentially compared to fourth quarter revenues of million 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to stronger demand from the wire line communications  digital television  industrial and voice over ip end markets  which offset seasonal declines in sales to the computing and wireless handset end markets 
revenues through micrel s sell through distributors increased in the first quarter of and the number of weeks of distribution channel inventory decreased slightly on a sequential basis 
gross margin improved to in the first quarter of from in the fourth quarter of while at the same time inventory levels were reduced 
first quarter operating profit was million  or of revenues 
earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of increased to per share from per share reported in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  the company became engaged in its first proxy contest since going public in  with a small activist hedge fund  obrem capital management llc ocm 
this issue resulted in micrel incurring incremental operating expenses on this matter of  in the first quarter  million in the second quarter   in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of see management discussions and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations proxy contest expense for additional information 
in the second quarter of  total bookings remained firm  resulting in a book to bill ratio above one 
second quarter bookings were paced by demand from customers serving the communications  industrial  and wireless handset end markets 
customers remained very cautious  which continued to keep order lead times in the to week range 
in the second quarter of  micrel posted its highest sequential revenue growth rate in four years 
second quarter revenues of million increased by million  or  from the first quarter of the growth in revenues was led by stronger demand from customers serving the wireline communications  wireless handset  and wi fi voice over ip end markets  combined with record sales through the company s global sell through distributors 
gross margin was  which was similar to gross margin in the first quarter of second quarter operating profit was million  or of sales 
a total of million of proxy contest expenses reduced micrel s operating income by approximately in the second quarter of  and also had the effect of reducing operating margin by approximately in the second quarter of second quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
expenses related to the company s proxy contest reduced net income by per share in the second quarter of financial markets in the united states  europe and asia experienced extreme disruption in the second half of  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
in the third quarter of  concerns related to the deterioration in the global financial and credit markets  including with respect to the availability and cost of credit  contributed to instability in worldwide capital and credit markets and diminished expectations for the us and global economy 
these conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of  and combined with uncertainty about the global economy in general  contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels and a further economic slowdown 
although governments have taken unprecedented actions in an attempt to alleviate the credit crisis  customers and consumers began to cut back on spending in order to conserve cash in the third quarter of this resulted in the slowing of orders from micrel s distributors and direct oem customers  which continued into the fourth quarter of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the third quarter of  total bookings were less than revenues  resulting in a book to bill ratio of less than one 
notwithstanding the order decrease  resales of the company s products from global sell through distributors remained strong throughout the quarter and were at the highest levels ever experienced by the company 
in the third quarter of  micrel posted million in revenue  a decrease of from the second quarter of the sequential quarter decrease in sales primarily resulted from reduced demand from customers serving the wireline communications  wi fi voice over ip and foundry sales to a major solar end customer 
this was offset by slight increases in the computer and consumer markets 
third quarter gross margin was  down from in the second quarter of operating income was million  or of sales 
this compares to operating income of million in the second quarter of other income  net was unchanged quarter to quarter at  the effective tax rate was for the third quarter 
third quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
fourth quarter revenue of million decreased by million  or  from million in the third quarter of the decrease in revenues was due to tight year end inventory control in most geographies  channels and end markets as a result of the worldwide financial crisis 
the worldwide macroeconomic recession in the fourth quarter caused the company s customers to focus on maintaining lean inventories 
the company s global distributors and a number of major oem customers took action to minimize inventories at year end 
as a consequence  customer orders and purchases declined in november and december after strong activity in october 
for the fourth quarter  micrel s overall book to bill ratio was below one 
fourth quarter gross margin was  compared to in the third quarter of the decrease in gross margin was the result of factory underutilization and additional inventory reserves due to a lower sales forecast 
fourth quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
for the year ended december   micrel s financial performance continued to be strong  especially in light of the existing economic conditions 
total revenues of million were up slightly  compared with million in net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in net income included a million pre tax gain associated with a first quarter legal settlement  which after income taxes  is equivalent to per diluted share 
gross margins for were compared to in solid cash flows from operations of million during the year enabled the repurchase of million shares of common stock  or approximately of the shares outstanding at the beginning of in addition  during the year ended december   the company paid cash dividends of million 
the worldwide macroeconomic recession continued to impact demand in the first quarter of and the company s customers continued to maintain lean inventory levels 
despite the difficult environment  first quarter bookings increased over fourth quarter levels and resulted in a book to bill ratio above one for both the oem and distribution sales channels 
the company s first quarter revenues were million  compared to million in the fourth quarter of first quarter gross margin was  compared to in the prior quarter 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of factory capacity under utilization as micrel continued to control its inventory levels 
first quarter net income was million  or per diluted share  as compared to fourth quarter net income of million  or per diluted share 
the company continued to enhance shareholder value by maintaining its quarterly three and one half cent per share dividend and repurchasing million shares under its stock repurchase plan 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued despite a continuing weak economic environment  the company experienced strong growth of both revenues and net income in the second quarter of bookings were solid which resulted in a book to bill ratio above one 
second quarter revenues grew on a sequential quarter basis for the first time in four quarters 
the company saw strength in all major segments of its business with primary growth coming from markets in china 
in particular  the build out of china s g infrastructure was an important driver for the company s revenue growth in the second quarter of revenues increased to million in the second quarter of  compared to million in the first quarter of second quarter operating expenses were down by sequentially 
second quarter net income of million was more than double the net income of million reported for the first quarter of in addition  the company continued to enhance shareholder value with its stock buy back program 
average shares outstanding in the second quarter of decreased by compared to the first quarter of in addition  the company also maintained its quarterly three and one half cent per share dividend payment 
revenues for the third quarter of totaled million  compared to million in the second quarter of  and million in the third quarter of sequential revenue growth was driven by increasing demand across most major markets served by the company  especially from the industrial  handset and automotive markets 
bookings for the third quarter of were solid and the book to bill ratio was above one for the third quarter in a row 
third quarter gross margin improved to  up from in the second quarter of  due to increased revenue levels to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
third quarter net income increased to million  or cents per diluted share as compared to million  or per diluted share in the second quarter of as a result of the company s ongoing expense management and the company s stock repurchase program  third quarter earnings per diluted share of were the same as the third quarter earnings per diluted share  despite significantly lower revenues in the third quarter of as compared to the third quarter of the company also maintained its quarterly three and one half cent per share dividend 
during the fourth quarter of  ordering strength from the industrial and communications end markets resulted in a book to bill ratio significantly above one  marking the fourth consecutive quarter where the book to bill exceeded one 
as a result  customer backlog at the end of is nearly two times as high as customer backlog at the end of revenues in the fourth quarter of increased to million  compared to million in the third quarter of the sequential growth was driven by increasing demand across most major markets for the company s products 
fourth quarter gross margin was  up from in the third quarter of the improvement in gross margin was due to better capacity utilization as a result of increased revenue levels to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
during the quarter  total operating expenses included a million non cash  pre tax charge related to the impairment of certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment located at the company s san jose fabrication facility 
as a result of this manufacturing equipment impairment  the company expects to realize future improved capacity utilization levels and a reduction in operating expenses 
fourth quarter operating income was million  or of sales 
this compares to operating income of million  or of sales in the third quarter fourth quarter net income was million  or per basic and diluted share  which included a per diluted share reduction due to the equipment impairment 
this compares with third quarter net income of million  or per basic and diluted share 
in addition  the company continued to maintain its quarterly three and one half cent per share dividend 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued micrel s financial performance for continued to be strong  especially when considering the challenging macroeconomic environment experienced during the company maintained its track record of profitability for out of years 
for the year ended december   revenue was million  compared to revenue of million in net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in during  micrel generated million in cash flow from operations  repurchased million of its common stock  purchased its san jose california corporate facility for approximately million  paid million of dividends to shareholders and made other capital investments of million 
over the last five years the company has repurchased million of its common stock and has paid million in dividends  returning approximately of its market capitalization to its shareholders 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion and in item a 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  including the global economic crisis  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based accounting  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue recognition and receivables 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to oem s  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
micrel allows certain distributors located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these returns and price concessions have historically been significant  and future returns and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue and related cost of sales are not recognized  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the distributor upon shipment 
in addition  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  the company may offer price adjustments to its distributors to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received and recorded by the company 
sales to oem customers and stocking representatives are recognized based upon the shipment terms of the sale transaction when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to stocking representatives 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain stocking representatives on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and stocking representatives  an allowance for returns is established based upon historical return rates  and an allowance for price adjustments is established based on an estimate of price adjustments to be granted 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once an inventory write down provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued share based compensation 
share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
to determine fair value  the company uses the black scholes valuation model which requires input factors such as expected term  stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
in addition  the company estimates expected forfeiture rates of stock grants and share based compensation expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest 
determining the input factors  such as expected term  expected volatility and estimated forfeiture rates  requires significant judgment based on subjective future expectations 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  and state research and development credit carryforwards 
the company must regularly assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
the company uses a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
during recent years  the company has resolved litigation involving intellectual property claims 
an estimated liability is accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the liability accrual is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative equipment impairment and restructuring charges credits proxy contest expense credits total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in standard product revenues  which represented of net revenues  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for other products revenues which consist primarily of custom and foundry product revenues  decreased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of net revenues for these decreases were the result of decreased unit shipments across all product lines and geographies due to a reduction in demand caused by the worldwide macroeconomic recession 
for the year ended december   net revenues increased to million compared to million in due to increased standard product revenues which were partially offset by decreased other products revenues 
the current global economic slowdown  unprecedented volatility in the capital markets and severely diminished liquidity and credit availability has exacerbated the ongoing weakness in the semiconductor industry 
this has materially softened demand for the company s products  and management is not able to predict whether macroeconomic conditions will continue to deteriorate or improve 
the persistence of such conditions could have a significant adverse effect on the company s revenues  profitability and results of operations 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for which product is requested to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry these orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenue  it makes it very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
because of the long cycle time to build its products  the company s lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
as noted in item a 
risk factors and above in the overview section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  a trend has developed over the last several years whereby customers in the semiconductor supply chain have worked to minimize the amount of inventory of semiconductors they hold 
as a consequence  customers are generally providing less order backlog to the company and other semiconductor suppliers  and relying on short lead times to buffer their build schedules 
shorter lead times reduce visibility into end demand and increase the reliance on turns fill orders 
the reluctance of customers to provide order backlog together with short lead times and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy  make it difficult to precisely predict future levels of sales and profitability 
international sales represented  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for this decrease resulted primarily from decreased shipments of standard products to europe and asia due to a reduction in demand caused by the worldwide macroeconomic recession 
sales to customers in asia represented of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  and of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has resulted in increased pricing pressure for micrel and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves in any manner other than by lowering prices 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for this decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from decreased manufacturing capacity utilization and decreased average selling prices in as compared to for the year ended december   the company s gross margin decreased to from for this decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from an increase in sales mix of lower margin products in as compared to 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented for each of the years ended december  and on a dollar basis  research and development expenses decreased million or to million for from million in these decreases were primarily due to decreased staffing levels and decreased prototype fabrication costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased  or to million from million in this increase was primarily due to increased prototype fabrication costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented for each of the years ended december  and on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for from million for this decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels  decreased commission expenses  decreased advertising expenses and decreased profit sharing accruals 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to million from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased outside legal costs 
proxy contest expense credits 
during the first quarter of  the company became engaged in a proxy contest with a small activist hedge fund  obrem capital management llc ocm 
this issue resulted in micrel incurring incremental expenses on this matter of million during during the fourth quarter of  the company negotiated a reduction in outside service fees related to the proxy contest and recorded a  credit 
these expenses consist primarily of outside consulting and legal fees 
subsequent to a special meeting of shareholders on may   at which the company s shareholders rejected all proposals set forth by ocm  ocm agreed to withdraw its slate of nominees for the board of directors  and support micrel s board nominees at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders 
micrel s slate of directors was subsequently elected by shareholders at the company s annual meeting on october  equipment impairment and restructuring charges credits 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of certain excess semiconductor manufacturing equipment which was removed from service and was held for sale as of december  the million net book value of the equipment held for sale was reduced to its estimated sales value of  during  the company closed its santa clara wafer fabrication facility 
in february  the company terminated the facility lease under the terms of the lease agreement due to major vandalism rendering the building unusable 
the facility lessor disputed the termination of the lease 
in march  the company entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with the lessor 
under the terms of the agreement  the company paid  to the lessor and released a  security deposit for full settlement of all obligations under the lease 
the remaining  unused restructuring expense accruals were credited to restructuring charges credits in the statement of operations during the first quarter of

other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term and long term investment securities and money market funds and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
included in the other income is million in non operating income resulting from the settlement of litigation 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes as compared to of income before taxes for and of income before taxes for these tax rate decreases resulted primarily from a greater impact of federal and state research and development credits due to reduced income before income taxes 
the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effects of non deductible share based compensation expense  state income taxes  federal and state research and development credits and federal qualified production activity deductions 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december   consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank 
the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities were primarily attributable to net income of million plus non cash activities of million consisting primarily of million in depreciation and amortization  million in share based compensation and a million impairment of equipment  offset in part by million in deferred income taxes benefits combined with a million decrease in inventory  a million decrease in income taxes receivable and a million increase in deferred income  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued compensation 
for the year ended december   the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities were primarily attributable to net income of million plus non cash activities of million consisting primarily of million in depreciation and amortization  million in share based compensation and a million decrease in deferred income taxes combined with a million decrease in accounts receivable  which were partially offset by a million increase in income taxes receivable and a million increase in inventory combined with a million decrease in accounts payable and a million decrease in other accrued liabilities 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company generated million of cash from investing activities during the year ended december   which was primarily comprised of million from the net proceeds of sales of short term investments  offset in part by million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  which included approximately million for the purchase of the company s previously leased headquarters facility

for the year ended december   the company used million of cash for financing activities  primarily for the repurchase of million of the company s common stock and million for the payment of cash dividends  which were partially offset by million in proceeds from employee stock transactions 
the company currently intends to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment and make facility improvements during the next twelve months primarily for manufacturing equipment and additional research and development related software and equipment 
on january   the company s board of directors declared a per common share cash dividend  payable february  to shareholders of record on february  on february   micrel s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock through december  the company believes that its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the longer term  the company believes future cash requirements will continue to be met by its cash from operations  credit arrangements and future debt or equity financings as required 
at december   the company held million in principal of senior auction rate notes secured by student loans 
auctions for these auction rate notes have failed as of december  the fair value of these notes  million  has been classified as long term investments as of december  the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers redeem the securities or the underlying securities have matured
