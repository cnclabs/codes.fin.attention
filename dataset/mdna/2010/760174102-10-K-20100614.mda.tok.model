item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business trends our corporate structure includes separate home entertainment and advanced media and information ami operating divisions and  accordingly  we report certain financial information by individual segment under this structure 
our home entertainment division  which was formerly known as the ppt division  manages our business operations that deliver units and related rental and sales information for the content to home video specialty stores and other retailers  on a revenue sharing basis 
we lease product from various suppliers  typically motion picture studios 
under our pay per transaction ppt system  retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
retailers then share a portion of the revenue from each retail rental transaction with us and we share a portion of the revenue with the studio 
since we collect  process and analyze rental and sales information at the title level  we report that information to both the studio and the respective retailers 
our home entertainment division also includes our direct revenue sharing drs services  which encompass the collection  tracking  auditing and reporting of transaction and revenue data generated by drs retailers  such as blockbuster entertainment and netflix  to our respective drs clients  for rented entertainment content received both on physical product as well as digitally  under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
our ami division manages our essentials suite of business information services 
our essentials suite software and services  offered primarily on a recurring subscription basis  provide unique data collection  management  analysis and reporting functions  resulting in business information valuable to our clients 
see forward looking statements in part i  item the home entertainment division the financial results from the home entertainment division continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video rental market as well as overall economic trends and conditions 
this market is highly competitive and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns and behaviors 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select their entertainment content and can easily shift from one provider to another 
some examples include renting units of product from our participating retailers or other retailers  purchasing previously viewed units from our participating retailers or other retailers  ordering product via online subscriptions and or online distributors mail delivery  renting or purchasing product from kiosk locations  subscribing to at home movie channels  downloading or streaming content via the internet  purchasing and owning the unit directly  or selecting an at home pay per view or on demand option from a satellite or cable provider 
our ppt system focuses on the traditional brick and mortar retailer 
we believe that our system successfully addresses the many choices available to consumers and affords our participating retailers the opportunity to stock their stores with a wider selection of titles and a greater supply of popular box office releases 
many of our arrangements are structured so that the participating retailers pay minimal upfront fees and lower per transaction fees in exchange for ordering units of all titles offered by a particular program supplier referred to as output programs 
since these programs usually result in more overall units rented  our participating retailers revenue and the corresponding share with the studios also increase 
in an effort to stabilize and maintain our current level of overall home entertainment division revenue and earnings  we have implemented strategies to obtain new participating retailers  as well as assist in the retention and growth of our current participating retailers 
the popularity of other choices  which an end consumer has to obtain entertainment content  has been growing and our participating retailers market share has been negatively affected 
thus  for the foreseeable future  we expect their market share to experience annual percentage declines and we are evaluating other initiatives to offset the effect this trend has on our home entertainment revenue and earnings 

table of contents we continue to be in good standing with our program suppliers  and we make on going efforts to strengthen those business relationships through enhancements to our current service offerings and the development of new service offerings  such as the addition of blu ray product 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
our relationships with program suppliers typically may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
ami division we continue to allocate significant resources towards our business information service offerings  both those services that are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our ami division revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed a long term contract and recognized million of revenue  which had previously been deferred 
the ami division lines of business which contribute most of the revenues currently are box office essentials  ondemand essentials  tv essentials  which includes stationview essentials  mobile essentials and internet tv essentials  and all other  which primarily includes home entertainment essentials 
box office essentials reports domestic and international theatrical gross receipt ticket sales to motion picture studios and movie theater owners 
we provide studios with access to box office performance data pertaining to specific motion pictures and movie theater circuits  both real time and historical 
on january   we acquired nielsen s edi business with operations in the united kingdom  australia  germany  france  mexico  argentina and spain 
please see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
currently  box office essentials delivers box office results from more than  movie screens across countries 
ondemand essentials provides multi channel operators  content providers including broadcast cable networks and studios and advertisers with a transactional tracking and reporting system to view and analyze the performance of on demand content 
we currently offer our services in the united states and canada and provide information representing over million set top boxes stbs from every major operator that offers vod programming 
tv essentials is a comprehensive suite of research tools that calculates anonymous second by second audience viewing patterns in all facets of television programming and advertising including vod  dvr  interactive and linear television 
by providing transaction level performance metrics from millions of stbs  tv essentials provides insight into programming effectiveness  enabling networks and network operators to optimize their tv advertising inventory 
designed to handle data from the nation s million television households  our systems can isolate individual market  network  series  or telecast performance  administer national and local estimates  and provide an evaluation of influencing factors such as psychographics and demographics for competitive  in depth intelligence 
on february   we expanded our agreement with one of our data partners  dish network dish and entered into a multi year contract  which will allow us to commercially integrate dish viewing data into tv essentials 
the dish relationship includes dvr and itv reporting  which can be rolled out to other partners once the data to drive those services becomes available to us 
we expect the integrated product to be available commercially during our quarter ending september  we have developed the capability to overlay segmentation databases to help our clients clearly define their advertising messages to consumers and we continue to build our research capabilities to move our products from data to knowledge based products and services 

table of contents we intend to continue to invest in our existing  as well as new  business information services in the near term as we expand the markets we serve and our service lines 
the cost of these investments will likely lower our earnings in the short term 
for example  during fiscal  we invested heavily in our multi screen essentials line of businesses  including expansion of our executive  sales and marketing team located in new york city  new york  which reduced our operating income 
cost of sales in the third quarter of also included a million one time fee relating to data integration services 
in addition  selling and administrative expenses included million of acquisition costs relating to international expansion in fiscal longer term  we believe we will be able to leverage these investments and generate revenue and earnings streams that contribute to our overall success 
sources of revenue revenue by segment includes the following home entertainment division transaction fees generated when retailers rent units to consumers  additionally  certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenues from our customers  we recognize the guaranteed minimum revenue on the street release date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  sell through fees generated when retailers sell previously viewed rental units to consumers and or buy out fees generated when retailers purchase units at the end of the lease term  drs fees from data tracking and reporting services provided to program suppliers  and other fees  which primarily include order processing fees generated when units are ordered by  and distributed to  participating retailers

the decrease in transactions was due in part to volume decreases as a result of the cumulative effect of fewer theatrical releases by our program suppliers in fiscal  as well as continued changing market conditions  including changes in consumer behavior  technological advances in entertainment content delivery and the perceived value of other home video entertainment alternatives  all of which led to a decrease in the number of stores ordering within our ppt system 
the decrease in the rate per transaction in fiscal was a result of the timing of releases with guaranteed units 

table of contents the decrease in transaction fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in rental transactions offset by a shift in mix to studios with more guarantees 
rental transactions declined due to the overall market conditions  including changes in consumer behavior  technological advances in entertainment content delivery and the perceived value of other alternatives 
the rate per transaction increased by  including the impact of minimum guarantees  due to the timing and magnitude of guarantees 
the decrease in sell through fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the number of used sale transactions  as a result of an overall decline in units available for sale 
units shipped decreased 
the decrease in sell through fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an overall decline in units available for sale  taking release dates and product sell through restrictions into account 
the decrease in drs fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the number of transactions processed as a result of an overall decline in activity experienced by drs brick and mortar retailers 
the increase in drs fees in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from adding new clients to this service offering 
the decrease in other revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in order processing fee revenue as a result of a reduction in the number of units shipped 
the increase in other revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from an increase in order processing fee revenue as a result of increases in the number of units shipped 
the number of units available for shipment tends to fluctuate from studio to studio and will vary based on the number of theatrical title releases in any given year 
ami division revenues from our ami division increased million  or  to million in fiscal and million  or  to million in fiscal detail of our ami division revenue by product was as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  dollar change change box office essentials ondemand essentials tv essentials all other year ended march  dollar change change box office essentials ondemand essentials tv essentials all other not meaningful 
the increase in box office essentials revenues of million in fiscal was primarily a result of our acquisition of the edi business and growth in our existing business 
the increase in box office essentials revenues of million in fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in syndication client revenue  as the result of adding new clients  and rate increases for existing accounts 

table of contents the increase in ondemand essentials revenues of million in fiscal was due to a combination of obtaining new clients and rate increases for existing clients 
the increase in ondemand essentials revenues of million in fiscal was primarily due to additional new client subscriptions  custom enhancements made for specific clients and rate increases for existing accounts 
tv essentials began generating recurring revenue in the second half of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  when tv essentials was still in development  we entered into a long term agreement with a customer supplier relating to this line of business  in which we began to develop reporting tools specifically relating to their unique business requirements 
we deferred this revenue  applying the completed contract method 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we substantially completed this contract and recognized the million of revenue and million of related costs 
we also added new clients to this service line in fiscal  which resulted in a million increase in revenue over fiscal revenues related to our essentials business information service offerings have increased primarily due to our continued investment in and successful marketing of these offerings and retention of clients 
we expect continued future increases in our essentials revenues as a result of further investments and additional successful launches of services 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of unit costs  transaction costs  sell through costs  handling and freight costs in the home entertainment division and costs in the ami division associated with certain essentials business information service offerings 
these expenditures represent the direct costs to produce revenues 
in the home entertainment division  unit costs  transaction costs and sell through costs represent the amounts due to the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
our cost of sales can also be impacted by the release dates of units with guarantees 
we recognize the guaranteed minimum costs on the release date 
the terms of some of our agreements result in cost of sales on titles in the first month in which the unit is released  which results in lower margins during the initial portion of the revenue sharing period 
once the unit s rental activity exceeds the required amount for these guaranteed minimums  margins generally expand during the second and third months of the unit s revenue sharing period 
however  since these factors are highly dependent upon the quality  timing and release dates of all new products  margins may not expand to any significant degree during any period 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the impact these program supplier revenue sharing programs with guaranteed minimums will have on future results of operations in any reporting period 
in the ami division  a portion of the essentials business information service offerings costs represent costs associated with the operation of a call center for our box office essentials services  as well as costs associated with amortizing capitalized internally developed software used to provide the corresponding services and direct costs incurred to obtain  cleanse and process data and maintain our systems 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the impact on cost of sales from lower home entertainment division revenues  partially offset by a one time fee of million in our ami division relating to data integration services  the recognition of million of previously deferred costs associated with the completion of the long term contract noted above  as well as an increase within the ami division due to increased costs associated with purchasing data within ondemand and multi screen essentials services and increased costs associated with amortizing capitalized internally developed software used to provide those services 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a larger percentage of revenue generated by our ami division  partially offset by the increased ami division costs discussed above 

table of contents the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the fluctuations in revenue  as well as the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the timing and magnitude of units shipped with minimum guarantees  as well as to a larger percentage of our revenue being produced by our ami division 
we achieve higher gross margins on our ami division revenue than on our home entertainment division revenue 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible fixed assets and software  real and personal property leases  as well as other general corporate expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  and increased million  or  in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the continued expansion of our multi screen essentials line of business  including the expansion of our executive  marketing and sales team and office in new york  costs associated with hiring our new chief executive officer and our chief operating officer and chief financial officer and costs relating to the acquisition of nielsen s edi business 
such costs are detailed below fiscal in millions non cash  stock based compensation expense recognized for equity awards granted to our new chief executive officer and our new chief operating officer and chief financial officer in fiscal non cash  stock based compensation related to two directors who departed from our board of directors during fiscal costs related to organizational changes  including relocation costs for our new chief operating officer acquisition related costs recurring costs relating to the edi business change in status of chairman of the board costs associated with addition and expansion of us office locations other please refer to notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling and administrative expenses also increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as a result of the higher overall costs combined with lower revenues 
we expect selling and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to additional costs related to the acquisition of the edi business as we fully integrate our respective systems  personnel and other resources over the next six months 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the continued expansion of our essentials lines of business 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to our continued investment in our essentials line of business in fiscal provision for doubtful accounts our provision for doubtful accounts increased million  or  to million in fiscal  and increased million  or  in fiscal 
table of contents the increases were primarily due to increases in accounts written off because the amounts owed were determined to be uncollectible and those amounts exceeded the amount we could recover from our program suppliers 
we expect this trend to continue during fiscal asset impairment during fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of  relating to a loss of customers in supply chain essentials 
management concluded that it was unlikely we would see any further growth from that line 
additionally  during fiscal  and  we recorded asset impairment charges related to various components of our essentials lines of business  which had been in development 
management concluded that it was likely the components would not be placed in service in the foreseeable future 
these asset impairment charges did not significantly alter management s plans for the expansion of its essentials services

in fiscal  our tax rate was positively affected by million of federal and state research and experimentation credits and negatively affected by a million charge associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash expected to be generated from future operations and investments and our million line of credit 
based on our current financial projections and projected cash needs  we believe that our available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our current operations  the continued current development of our business information services and other cash requirements through at least march  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million to million at march  this decrease resulted primarily from million used for the purchase of equipment and capitalized it costs  million used for the acquisition of the edi business  net of cash acquired  and million used for the repurchase of our common stock

the deferred rent is being amortized against rent expense over the term of the related lease at the rate of approximately  per quarter 
in january  our board of directors adopted a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
we repurchased  shares in fiscal at an average price of per share  all of which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal through march   a total of  shares had been repurchased under this plan at an average price of per share and  shares remained available for purchase 
no additional shares have been repurchased since march  this plan does not have an expiration date

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been delivered  the license period has begun which is referred to as the street date for a product  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
ppt agreements generally provide for an initial order processing fee and continuing transaction fees based on a percentage of rental revenues earned by the participating retailers upon renting the units to their customers 
initial order processing fees cover the direct costs of accessing units from program suppliers and handling  packaging and shipping of the units to the participating retailer 
once the units are shipped  we have no further obligation to provide services to the participating retailer 
we recognize order processing fees as revenue on the street date and recognize transaction fees when the units are rented to the consumers  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenues from our customers 
in these arrangements  we recognize the guaranteed minimum revenue on the street date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a long term agreement with a customer supplier relating to our essentials line of business  in which we developed reporting tools specifically relating to their unique business requirements 
we recognized revenue using the completed contract method and  accordingly  we recognized the revenue and related costs when the development project was completed in the second quarter of fiscal we recognize other services revenue  including drs revenue in our home entertainment division  and business information services revenue in our ami division  ratably over the period of service 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million at both march  and see also schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts included in item of this annual report on form k 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of  and million  respectively  recorded against our net operating and capital loss carryforwards in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
net deferred tax liabilities totaled million and million  respectively  as of march  and 
table of contents accounting for unrecognized tax benefits we record a benefit for uncertain tax positions only when we determine that those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of march  and  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively  including penalties and interest of  and  respectively 
all unrecognized tax benefits at march  would affect the effective tax rate if recognized 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software capitalized software  which is included in property and equipment  net  consists of costs to purchase and develop internal use software  as well as costs to develop internal software which is used by us to provide various services to clients 
such internal and external costs to develop the internal software used to support these services are capitalized after the technological and business feasibility of the project is determined and the preliminary project stage is completed 
we continue to develop our internal software systems in order to expand our service offerings 
once we begin to utilize such software in our products  these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is five years 
capitalized software is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based on these reviews  we recorded impairment charges of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of such assets 
capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million at march  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  deferred stock units dsus  stock appreciation rights sars  stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars and restricted stock units rsus based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for valuing our stock based awards 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest and market based awards 
however  we have not reduced the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures as there is no basis for estimating future forfeitures as most unvested options are held by members of senior management and the board of directors 
we update for forfeitures as they occur and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures are significant  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
stock based compensation agreements with non employees we are required to recognized compensation expense for stock based compensation agreements with non employees based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date and at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model to determine the end of period fair value of these awards and record the cumulative incremental change in value as compensation expense over the life of the award 

table of contents marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale securities and  accordingly  they are marked to market on a quarterly basis  with unrealized gains and losses being excluded from earnings and reflected as a component of other comprehensive income 
dividend and interest income is recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
acquisition of the edi business the purchase price for the edi business acquisition was allocated based on the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired which have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
we will test these assets for impairment annually  beginning on february   or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired  based on cash flows and other market valuation methods 
we amortize intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and evaluate for impairment in accordance with our existing policy impairment of long lived assets 
new accounting guidance see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements other than as disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our cash deposits and marketable securities 
we have evaluated and assessed the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we operate globally and have exposure to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in most markets  we generate revenue and expenses in local currencies 
foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of operations and balance sheets from functional currency to our reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes 
our most significant foreign currency risks relate to the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar 
we have evaluated and assessed the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in currency rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
