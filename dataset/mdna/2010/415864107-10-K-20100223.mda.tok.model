executive overview the following major challenges  emanating from the global recession that began in  impacted the company in unprecedented low steel production throughout the world  a lack of available credit to certain customers that caused commercial and multi family construction contracts to be cancelled or postponed  an overall stronger us dollar during compared with  and pricing pressure across all businesses as customers sought to control costs during the recession and increased competition for the remaining projects 
in response to further deterioration of global markets during  the company supplemented its restructuring initiatives with additional countermeasures targeting expense reduction  revenue enhancement and asset optimization 
the combination of the and countermeasures have enabled the company to make substantial progress in reducing its cost structure 
the savings realized from these initiatives will continue to benefit and beyond 
the company s actions to minimize its cost base and increase efficient asset utilization have included the following redeployment of its mobile asset base in the harsco infrastructure and harsco metals segments to focus on market segments that remain strong and provide growth opportunities  such as the relocation of infrastructure rental assets from the united kingdom and ireland to the gulf region of the middle east and asia pacific  and to markets served by recent acquisitions in latin america  this helped enable a substantial reduction in capital spending  reduction in the global workforce of approximately since september and substantial reductions in discretionary spending  continued expansion of the company s continuous improvement initiatives  substantial reductions in capital spending resulting in record discretionary cash flows  strengthening certain key positions in the global leadership team with new personnel  implementation of supply chain optimization initiatives  and implementation of countermeasures to improve efficiency and remove unnecessary costs 
the company s revenues from continuing operations totaled billion  a decrease of billion or from the company experienced lower volume levels resulting from a deterioration of global steel markets and weaker demand for infrastructure services resulting  in part  from the lack of credit to finance projects  particularly in the united kingdom  north america and several other key european countries 
foreign currency translation decreased sales by million and accounted for approximately of the decline in sales 
operating income from continuing operations was million compared with million in  a decrease of 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  a decrease from results in included a charge of per share in the fourth quarter for a significant restructuring initiative 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a net non cash charge of per basic and diluted share for adjustments related principally to the improper recording of revenue by one business unit in one country  over a period of approximately three years 
previously issued financial statements were not revised based on the company s determination that the cumulative effect was not material to the full year results or previously issued annual or quarterly financial statements 
revenues from the company s targeted growth markets were approximately and of total revenues for and  respectively 
revenues by region were as follows revenues by region total revenues twelve months ended december percentage growth from to dollars in millions percent percent volume currency total western europe north america middle east and africa latin america a eastern europe asia pacific total a includes mexico during  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million compared with million achieved in for  capital expenditures were reduced to million compared with million in as existing capital assets were used more efficiently 
the company continues to have significant available liquidity and remains well positioned from a financial flexibility perspective 
net cash from operating activities for is less than in due primarily to lower income as a result of the global recession  but was offset by lower capital expenditures compared with prior years  as the mobility of the capital asset base provided the ability to reallocate resources globally 
this reallocation was performed without substantial new investments or harm to the productivity of the equipment in the short term  and confirmed the flexibility of the company s capital allocation model 
the reduction in capital spending has thus allowed the company to further enhance its balance sheet  maintain its dividend  reduce debt to the extent possible under borrowing agreements and pursue prudent  bolt on acquisitions that are consistent with the company s growth strategies 
the company s cash flows are further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
segment summary the harsco infrastructure segment generated lower revenue and operating income in compared with the reductions in were due principally to reduced end market demand  particularly in the united kingdom  north america and several other key european countries  and negative foreign currency translation effects 
lower demand was driven by the lack of available credit to certain customers that has resulted in cancelled and delayed non residential construction projects  as well as a significant decline in export sales of infrastructure related equipment 
this segment s revenues in were billion compared with billion in  a decrease 
operating income decreased by to million  from million in operating margins for the segment declined to from in foreign currency translation decreased revenues and operating income for by million and million  respectively  in comparison with harsco infrastructure accounted for and of the company s revenues and operating income  respectively  in  compared with and of the revenues and operating income  respectively  for results for the harsco metals segment for reflected unprecedented customer steel production cuts resulting from lower end market demand due to the global recession 
revenues for for the harsco metals segment were billion compared with billion in  a decrease 
volume decreases attributable to steel production cuts drove of the reduction in year over year sales and negative foreign currency translation contributed of the decline 
this segment generated operating income of million during compared with operating income of million in foreign currency translation decreased revenues and operating income for by million and million  respectively  in comparison with harsco metals accounted for and of the company s revenues and operating income  respectively  in  compared with and of the revenues and operating income  respectively  for the harsco rail segment s revenues in were million compared with million in  a increase 
operating income increased by to million from million in operating margins for this segment increased by basis points to from in the harsco rail business generated higher revenues in compared with due principally to shipments of equipment to china under contracts with the china ministry of railways 
harsco rail accounted for and of the company s revenues and operating income  respectively  in  compared with and of the revenues and operating income  respectively  for in the all other category harsco minerals harsco industrial  revenues in were million compared with million in  a decrease of 
operating income decreased by to million from million in  due principally to volume and commodity price declines in the minerals business and an overall market decline in the industrial grating products business 
operating margins for the all other category decreased by basis points to a still respectable from in the minerals business continued to be adversely impacted by the downturn in metals production and fluctuating commodity prices and the industrial products business experienced an overall market decline as customers reduced stock levels from high inventory levels 
the all other category accounted for and of the company s revenues and operating income  respectively  in compared with and of the revenues and operating income  respectively  for highlights the following significant items affected the company overall during in comparison with company wide revenues and operating income were impacted by the global recession as o the average value of the us dollar increased significantly from to  accounting for of the sales decline and of the decline in operating income  o global steel production  which began to decline in the latter part of  remained at unprecedented low levels in  and o restrictive lending and credit practices continued to adversely affect non residential construction projects worldwide  this was coupled with pricing pressure as customers sought price breaks and competitors pursued the limited number of available projects 
during  the company s operating income benefited from the restructuring actions implemented in the fourth quarter of operational improvements were also recognized as a result of additional countermeasures implemented throughout targeting expense reduction  revenue enhancement and asset optimization 
cost savings from the combination of the and countermeasures should manifest themselves throughout and beyond with significant annualized benefits 
due to strong operating cash flows and controlled capital spending  the company repaid debt of million in balance sheet debt declined by a lower million in the same period due to foreign currency translation 
cash flow from operations for was million 
this was more than sufficient to fund the cash requirements for investing activities of million while also providing excess funds to reduce debt 
harsco infrastructure segment dollars in millions revenues operating income operating margin percent harsco infrastructure segment significant effects on revenues in millions revenues net decreased volume impact of foreign currency translation acquisitions revenues harsco infrastructure segment significant effects on operating income in  the segment s operating results decreased due to reduced non residential  commercial and infrastructure construction spending  particularly in the united kingdom  north america and several other key european countries 
this was partially offset by continued strength in emerging economies in the gulf region of the middle east and asia pacific regions  as well as the global industrial maintenance sector 
the company has benefited from its capital investments made in these markets in prior years and its ability to redeploy equipment throughout the world 
in response to further deterioration of global infrastructure markets during  this segment implemented additional countermeasures targeting expense reduction  asset optimization and facility rationalization

a reversal of revenue improperly recognized over the prior three years resulted in an operating income decrease that was recorded in the third quarter of the improperly recorded revenue related to the failure to receive advance customer agreement and to invoice on a timely basis for additional work performed for two customers 
this matter was isolated to a business unit in one country and is considered a one time event

the air cooled heat exchangers business experienced a modest increase in operating income in as declines in operating income due to sales volume decreases were offset by lower commodity costs and benefits from continuous improvement actions 
operating income for the minerals business decreased in due to significantly lower metal prices and product mix 
countermeasures targeting expense reduction  revenue enhancement and asset optimization were implemented in these businesses and partially offset the declines in operating income 
foreign currency translation in decreased operating income for the all other category by million compared with outlook  trends and strategies company wide economic uncertainty remains throughout the world as a result of the global financial and economic crisis that started in during the latter part of  certain negative economic trends began to slowly abate  as overall steel production at mills served by the company s operations showed a modest sequential quarterly increase and the us dollar weakened against certain major currencies 
while improving steel production and a weaker us dollar generally contribute positively to the company s performance  expectations are that many of the challenges stemming from the global recession will continue in  particularly in the first half  with the first quarter being the worst of the year 
the lack of activity in many of the non residential  commercial construction markets served by the company poses near term challenges that include further pressure on pricing and equipment utilization 
these lower levels of activity have been exacerbated by extreme winter weather conditions across many parts of europe and the united states  which are also expected to have a negative impact on operating results in the first quarter of although global economic conditions remain uncertain  the company believes it is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities and execute appropriate countermeasures based on its strong balance sheet  available liquidity and ability to generate strong operating cash flows 
the company has implemented and will continue to proactively and aggressively implement countermeasures to reinforce current and future performance 
the company is confident that its on going cost reduction initiatives  its global supply chain initiative with ibm  along with its continuous improvement program  have significantly reduced  and will continue to reduce  the company s cost structure and further enhanced its financial strength 
the company s expansion of its global footprint in emerging markets  its diversity of services and products in industries that are fundamental to global growth  its long term mill services and minerals supply contracts  the portability and mobility of its infrastructure services equipment  and its large infrastructure services customer base help mitigate its overall exposure to changes in any single economy 
however  continued or further deterioration of global economies could still have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
the following significant items  risks  trends and strategies are expected to affect the company in and beyond the company expects continued strong cash flows from operating activities 
the company also expects to maintain discipline to limit capital expenditures through its ability to redeploy equipment to new projects  without jeopardizing the productivity of the equipment 
the company believes that in the current economic environment  the mobile nature of its capital investment pool will facilitate strategic growth initiatives in the near term  lessening the need for growth capital expenditures for management will continue to be very selective and disciplined in allocating capital  choosing projects with the highest economic value added eva potential 
the company will continue to develop and implement countermeasures  as it has on an ongoing basis since the fourth quarter of  to further compress underlying administration and operating costs to match the current economic environment and lower its break even point without sacrificing quality of output 
continued implementation of the company s enterprise wide continuous improvement program is expected to provide long term benefits and enhance the overall performance of the company through increased efficiency and a reduced cost structure 
the company announced in january that it has embarked upon a business transformation initiative designed to create significant operating and cost efficiencies by improving the company s internal supply chain planning  logistics  scheduling and integration throughout its worldwide operations 
this project is expected to contribute to the company s eva growth but could result in near term  cost increases and capital expenditures 
the company will continue to place a strong focus on corporate wide expansion into emerging economies to grow and better balance its geographic footprint 
more specifically  the company s global growth strategies include steady  targeted expansion  particularly in the gulf region of the middle east and africa  asia pacific and latin america to further complement the company s already strong presence throughout europe and north america 
growth is expected to be achieved through the provision of additional services to existing customers  new contracts in both developed and emerging markets  and targeted  strategic  bolt on acquisitions in strategic countries and market sectors 
additionally  new higher margin service and sales opportunities in the minerals and rail businesses will be pursued globally 
this strategy is expected to develop a significant increase to the company s presence in these markets to achieve approximately of total company revenues from emerging markets over the next several years and closer to in the longer term 
over time  the improved geographic footprint will also benefit the company through further diversification of its customer base 
fluctuations in the us dollar can have significant impacts in the harsco infrastructure and harsco metals segments  as approximately to of the revenues generated in these businesses are outside the united states 
if the us dollar would strengthen  as it did overall from to  sales and operating income would generally be reduced 
if the us dollar were to weaken  sales and operating income would generally improve 
governments around the world have enacted stimulus packages to promote much needed infrastructure projects 
any substantial near term benefit from stimulus packages is uncertain  particularly in the united states and the united kingdom 
when stimulus package funding becomes available for infrastructure projects  which has been limited thus far  the harsco infrastructure and the harsco rail segments are well positioned with their engineering expertise and the company s capital investment base to take advantage of any expected opportunities 
the harsco minerals business should also benefit from increased demand for its abrasive products as required by refurbishment stimulus projects 
steel production in is expected to increase over levels in  benefitting the harsco metals segment 
volatility in energy and commodity costs eg  crude oil  natural gas  steel  etc 
and worldwide demand for these commodities could impact the company s operations 
cost increases could result in reduced operating income for certain products and services  to the extent that such costs cannot be passed to customers 
cost decreases could result in increased operating income to the extent that such cost savings do not need to be passed on to customers 
however  volatility in energy and commodity costs may provide additional service opportunities for the harsco metals segment and several businesses in the all other category as customers may outsource more services to reduce overall costs 
volatility may also provide opportunities in the harsco infrastructure segment for additional industrial plant maintenance and capital improvement projects 
in addition to embracing opportunities for revenue enhancement  the company seeks to mitigate these costs as part of its ongoing enterprise wide optimization initiatives 
total defined benefit net periodic pension expense for is expected to be approximately million  slightly higher than the increased expense is due to a lower discount rate at december   partially offset by higher than expected returns on plan assets in these two factors are the primary drivers of the company s defined benefit net periodic pension expense as future service is no longer a factor in substantially all of the company s significant defined benefit plans 
the company has maintained a capital structure with a balance sheet debt to capital ratio approximating for the last several years 
in october  the company s million british pound sterling denominated notes approximately million at december  will mature 
the company expects to refinance these notes during through public debt  commercial paper borrowings or its revolving credit facilities 
as the company has continued the strategic expansion of its global footprint  it has lowered its effective income tax rate 
the reduction reflects earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates coupled with the deferral of profits generated internationally 
the effective income tax rate for  before discrete items  is currently expected to be approximately to 
currently  a majority of the company s revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states  and a substantial portion of the company s assets and employees are located outside the united states 
us income tax and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non us subsidiaries  because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 
several us legislation proposals have been announced that would substantially reduce or have the effect of substantially reducing the company s ability to defer us taxes on profit permanently reinvested outside the united states 
proposals to date could have a negative impact on the company s financial position and operating results 
additionally  they could have a negative impact on the company s ability to compete in the global marketplace 
the probability of any of these proposals being enacted cannot be predicted with any certainty 
indications are that reform in is still likely  but such reform may be structured with more of the business community s concerns in mind 
nonetheless  the company is working with legislators with the goal of achieving a balanced and fair approach to tax reform 
the company continues to monitor legislation to be in position to structure operations in a manner that will reduce the impact of enacted changes 
the company s harsco minerals business generates value by capturing and processing boiler slag  which is a coal combustion by product 
the epa is considering increased regulation of the management of coal combustion by products 
such requirement could affect the harsco minerals business 
the company is confident at this time  based upon epa confirmation in the year and again in  that there is no change in science that requires increased regulation of boiler slag 
additionally  the company believes no scientific data exists to support reclassification of boiler slag 
harsco infrastructure segment the near term outlook for the harsco infrastructure segment is impacted by continued uncertainty in global credit markets  which has caused construction projects to be deferred or cancelled  thus contributing to pricing pressure 
the current lack of activity in non residential  commercial construction markets  particularly in the united kingdom  ireland  other parts of europe and the united states  coupled with harsh winter weather conditions across many parts of europe and the united states  are expected to present very challenging business conditions in the first half of  particularly in the first quarter 
as a result  the company expects an operating loss for the quarter ending march  the company has initiated a transformational strategy in the harsco infrastructure segment that includes the following o effective in january  all operations within this segment have been rebranded as harsco infrastructure 
previously  the harsco infrastructure segment utilized three brand names sgb group  h nnebeck group and patent construction systems 
o the costs and viability of the existing branch structure will continue to be scrutinized with a targeted goal of reducing the number of branches by from the number  exclusive of recent acquisitions 
o a global supply chain optimization plan is being developed to identify initiatives that  when implemented should generate considerable operating and cost efficiencies 
o the productivity of branches will be improved through the continued use of the company s continuous improvement program and implementation of best practices across the network of branches 
o additional countermeasures to adjust administration and operating costs to match the economic environment and to lower the segment s cost structure are being implemented 
to assist in accelerating these initiatives  the company expects to incur approximately million to million in restructuring costs during the first quarter of o the company has initiated strategies to reposition the business  focusing increasingly on projects in the global industrial maintenance and infrastructure construction sectors 
in  approximately of the segment s business was in the commercial and multi family sector  which has been impacted the most by tightened credit restrictions and the global economic downturn 
the remainder of current business was spread approximately each to the industrial maintenance and the infrastructure sectors 
over the next few years  the company is targeting an allocation of approximately each in the industrial maintenance and infrastructure sectors  with in the commercial and multi family sector 
industrial maintenance contracts generally are long term contracts with sustainable revenue streams serving the oil and gas  pharmaceutical  chemical  electric utility power plant and steel industries 
infrastructure contracts also tend to be longer term contracts with blue chip contractors and include government sponsored projects from stimulus programs 
the company will continue to emphasize prudent expansion of its geographic presence in this segment through entering new markets and through further expansion in emerging economies  with a focus on china  india and latin america 
the harsco infrastructure segment s value added services and engineered forming  shoring and scaffolding systems  combined with its mobile capital investment base  will continue to be leveraged to grow the business as expansion opportunities occur 
in  the company will fully integrate its recent acquisitions esco  a regional leader in infrastructure services in seven countries in central and south america  and bell scaffolding group  with operations across the eastern seaboard of australia 
esco is expected to provide an opportunity for the company to scale its operations across the latin american region  while bell scaffolding provides opportunities for further growth throughout australia and other neighboring regions 
further declines in the economy and  more specifically  the construction industry may impact the ability of customers to meet their obligations to the company on a timely basis and could adversely impact the realizability of receivables  particularly if customers file for bankruptcy protection or receivership 
harsco metals segment steel industry expectations are that steel production will increase in compared with  but not to the levels of the first half of  prior to the beginning of the global recession 
consistent with the industry overall  the harsco metals segment s customers increased their production in the last half of  and those production levels are expected to increase modestly throughout the company expects that customer production growth in can be accommodated with minimal headcount additions and limited capital spending by continued adherence to the company s continuous improvement program and prudent redeployment of labor and capital 
benefits from the company s restructuring program and additional countermeasures implemented in should continue to improve the operational efficiency and enhance profitability of the harsco metals segment in and beyond 
additional countermeasures will be undertaken in to continue to lower the cost base of this segment 
restructuring and countermeasure initiatives to date have included improved terms or exit from underperforming contracts with customers and underperforming operations  defined benefit pension plan design changes  overall reduction in the global workforce  and a substantial reduction in discretionary spending 
the company anticipates that tightening environmental regulations will compel customers to address their production waste streams as an opportunity to maximize environmental compliance 
this should provide additional revenue opportunities for the company 
the harsco metals segment s award of a million  multi year contract to clean up million cubic yards of material left behind at an abandoned steelworks may be seen as a model for similar sites by the us environmental protection agency 
the company will continue to pursue growth opportunities in environmental services as awareness of environmental issues creates additional outsourced functions in slag management 
as the steel manufacturing footprint moves towards developing countries  the company will continue to execute a geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets in the gulf region of the middle east and africa  latin america and asia pacific 
further consolidation in the global steel industry is possible 
should additional consolidations occur involving some of the steel industry s larger companies that are customers of the company  it could result in an increase in concentration of revenues and credit risk for the company 
if a large customer were to experience financial difficulty  or file for bankruptcy protection  it could adversely impact the company s income  cash flows and asset valuations 
as part of its credit risk management practices  the company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base 
further consolidation may also increase pricing pressure on the company and the competitive risk of services contracts that are due for renewal 
conversely  such consolidation may provide additional service opportunities for the company as the company believes it is well positioned competitively 
as a result of this customer concentration  a key strategy of the company is to diversify its customer base and expand to emerging market customers 
harsco rail segment the harsco rail segment has a strong backlog for due principally to ongoing production of rail grinding machines for the china ministry of railways 
the contract will generate revenues through further implementation of the company s continuous improvement initiatives are expected to improve margins on a long term basis 
us and global customers are investing heavily in rebuilding their physical assets 
although reduced freight revenues experienced by a customer may involve a cut in track maintenance budgets  improved margins can be realized due to extended work windows as increased track time is available for maintenance activity 
us railway track maintenance service opportunities are expected to increase over the mid term as many states have budget proposals for track services under the us stimulus package 
new construction of high speed rail systems is also expected to be financed with government funds over the near and long term 
international demand for railway track maintenance services  solutions and equipment is expected to be strong in both the near term and the long term 
the harsco rail segment expects to develop a larger presence in certain developing countries as track maintenance and construction needs grow 
global bidding activity has been strong 
this segment will continue to pursue cost reduction initiatives to reduce its overall cost base 
these initiatives could result in near term capital expenditures and restructuring costs 
all other category harsco minerals harsco industrial the company will emphasize prudent global expansion of its minerals business for extracting high value metallic content from slag and responsibly handling and recycling residual materials 
environmental services provide growth opportunities in the minerals business as additional outsourced functions in slag management of stainless steel and other high value metals arise 
improved customer production levels should have an overall positive effect on certain reclamation and recycling services in the near term 
metal prices remained relatively flat in the latter part of  however  any increases would have a positive effect on operating results  while decreases would have a negative impact 
certain businesses in this category are dependent on a small group of key customers 
the loss of one of these customers due to competition or due to financial difficulty  or the filing for bankruptcy protection  could adversely impact the company s income  cash flows and asset valuations 
as part of its credit risk management practices  the company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base 
worldwide supply and demand for steel and other commodities impact raw material costs for certain businesses in this category 
the company has implemented strategies to help mitigate the potential impact that changes in steel and other commodity prices could have on operating income 
if steel or other commodity costs associated with the company s manufactured products increase and the costs cannot be passed on to the company s customers  operating income would be adversely affected 
conversely  reduced steel and other commodity costs would improve operating income to the extent such savings do not have to be transferred to customers 
the air cooled heat exchangers business continues to explore international opportunities in addition to further growth in its customary north american markets 
overall sales are expected to be negatively impacted by a lower level of industrial demand for natural gas as a result of lower natural gas prices and the global recession 
low natural gas prices throughout curtailed the need for additional gas compression and coolers to support that compression 
increased industrial use due to improving economic conditions  as well as weather patterns over the winter months  will influence the price and demand for natural gas and  consequently  the demand for heat exchanger equipment 
colder weather tends to increase demand for heat exchanger equipment while warmer weather tends to result in reduced demand
