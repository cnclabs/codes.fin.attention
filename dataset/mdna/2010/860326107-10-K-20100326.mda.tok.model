item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides an analysis of the stewardship financial corporation s the corporation consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december  and the analysis should be read in conjunction with the related audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein 
cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this annual report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  and may be identified by the use of such words as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential 
examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of the corporation that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates 
these factors include changes in general  economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory conditions  or the development of an interest rate environment that adversely affects the corporation s interest rate spread or other income anticipated from operations and investments 
as used in this annual report  we and us and our refer to stewardship financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiary  atlantic stewardship bank  depending on the context 
introduction the corporation s primary business is the ownership and supervision of the bank and  through the bank  the corporation has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
the corporation currently has full service branches offices located in bergen  passaic and morris counties in new jersey 
the corporation conducts a general commercial and retail banking business encompassing a wide range of traditional deposit and lending functions along with the other customary banking services 
the corporation earns income and generates cash primarily through the deposit gathering activities of the branch network 
these deposits gathered from the general public are then utilized to fund the corporation s lending and investing activities 
the corporation has developed a strong deposit base with good franchise value 
a mix of a variety of different deposit products  along with a strong focus on customer service  is used to attract customers and build depositor relationships 
challenges facing the organization are to continue to grow the existing branch levels  provide adequate technology enhancements to achieve efficiencies  offer a competitive product line  and provide the highest level of customer service 
the corporation is affected by the overall economic conditions in northern new jersey  the interest rate and yield curve environment  and the overall national economy 
these factors are relevant because they will affect our ability to attract specific deposit products  our ability to invest in loan and investment products  and our ability to earn acceptable profits without incurring increased risks 
when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the corporation  management reviews historical trends  peer comparisons  asset and deposit concentrations  interest margin analysis  adequacy of loan loss reserve and loan quality performance  adequacy of capital under current positions as well as to support future expansion  adequacy of liquidity  and overall quality of earnings performance 
the branch network provides for solid coverage in both existing and new markets in key towns in the three counties in which we operate 
the corporation continually evaluates the need to further develop the infrastructure to enable the entity to continue to build franchise value  expand its customer base  and offer appropriate products and services to its existing and future customer base 
during the corporation opened three new branch locations 
management has been encouraged by the positive reception received for these three branches and believes that each of these branches contribute to a strong branch network 
as the branches continue to mature  they provide a strong diverse customer base of both consumer and business customers 
in  the corporation  like all financial institutions  continued to experience a difficult and complicated economic and operating environment 
the corporation s results have been affected by the economic downturn through higher loan loss provisions 
in addition  competition in the northern new jersey market remained intense and the challenges of operating throughout the year in a flat interest rate market continued to make it somewhat difficult to attract deposits at appropriate interest rate levels 
although the area in which the bank operates has been somewhat shielded by the national economic downturn  management continues to find it challenging to attract low cost core deposits 
furthermore  while the current economic conditions and softness in the real estate market have contributed to an 
table of contents increase in loan delinquencies  lending opportunities have been appropriately addressed 
the corporation has not been involved in the subprime lending area 
in an effort to address the strong competition in attracting deposit balances  in mid february we introduced our new power rate checking product 
this new offering pays a premium rate of interest and refunds atm fees charged by other financial institutions 
in return  the customer has simple monthly qualification factors such as enrolling in online banking with electronic statements and minimum levels of debit card usage 
this product contributed to the growth in deposits during as well as increased fee income related to debit cards and reduced expenses related to statement rendition 
from time to time the corporation has utilized brokered certificates of deposit to supplement deposit growth 
however  at december  the corporation had no brokered certificates of deposit compared to million as of december  improvements and upgrades of our electronic online banking products and services continued to be a priority for during we introduced an online banking cash management product as well as remote deposit capture services for businesses 
additional development and testing of technology  including mobile banking  was performed in leading to a planned introduction 
in addition to a focus on increasing non interest income  in there was a renewed emphasis on expense control 
however  substantial increases of the fdic insurance premium resulted in increased expenses incurred by the corporation during l 
as a result of losses to the fdic insurance fund from recent bank failures as well as projected bank failures  the fdic increased its insurance premium rates to all banks in in addition  the fdic imposed a basis point special assessment on all banks  based on june  total assets net of tier capital 
total fdic insurance premium expense for represented an  increase over including the recording of approximately  of expense for the special assessment 
in  the corporation received million as part of the united states treasury capital purchase program cpp 
the additional capital provided by the cpp solidified our already well capitalized position  thereby enhancing our ability to continue to grow assets and increasing our ability to make new loans 
accordingly  we can better serve the lending needs of consumers and businesses in our market 
despite facing economic and unprecedented challenges in  the corporation continued to perform well when compared with peer group performance 
the corporation will continue to concentrate its efforts on growing and maturing its existing branch network  developing new products and services  capitalizing on technology and focusing on improved efficiencies during recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent pronouncements and their effect on the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements can be found in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the corporation s significant accounting policies 
management believes the corporation s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate  which is subject to significant 
table of contents judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the northern new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 
earnings summary the corporation reported net income of million  or diluted earnings per common share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or diluted earnings per common share recorded for results for the current year include increased expense associated with a fdic special assessment 
the return on average assets of in was relatively unchanged from in the return on average equity decreased to for from in results of operations net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is the net interest income derived from the bank  which represents the difference between the interest earned on assets and interest paid on funds acquired to support those assets 
net interest income is affected by the balances and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in their corresponding yields and costs  and by the volume of interest earning assets funded by noninterest bearing deposits 
the corporation s principal interest earning assets are loans made to businesses and individuals and investment securities 
for the year ended december   net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased to million from million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of million  or 
the increase in the current year is due to an increase of million  or  in net average interest earning assets average interest earning assets less average interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a decrease in the net yield on interest earning assets 
the net interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and for the year ended december  the net interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets for the current year reflect a decline in loan interest rates and yields on securities as well as a decline in the interest rates on deposits and borrowings 
the corporation attempted to proactively manage deposit costs in an effort to mitigate the lower asset yields attributable to historically low market rates 
for the year ended december   total interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased  or  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due to a decrease in yields on interest earning assets partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the average rate earned on interest earning assets decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to in the current year 
the decline in short term interest rates during resulted in a prime rate of at december  compared to a prime rate of in january of dropping to in september the decline in short term rates resulted in loans resetting during the past year at lower interest rates  thereby contributing to the decline in yields on earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased million in  or  over the amount with average investment securities increasing million  reflecting the leverage strategy undertaken to invest the million in funds raised through the issuance of preferred stock under the capital purchase program the cpp 
interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december  to million 
the decrease was attributable to a decline in the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  compared to during average interest bearing liabilities were million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of million  or  when compared to million for the year ended december  in addition to the corporation s expanding customer base  the increase in average interest bearing liabilities was a result of increased borrowings to complete the leveraging of the million of cpp funds 
the corporation continues to supplement its branch deposit network with a mix of wholesale repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank borrowings 
these alternative funding sources help to lower cost of funds and provide for better management of interest rate risk 
there were no brokered certificates of deposit for the majority of

table of contents the following table analyzes net interest income in terms of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in yields earned and rates paid on such assets and liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
the table reflects the extent to which changes in the corporation s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior year rate and changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior year volume

on an ongoing basis  management analyzes the adequacy of this allowance by considering the nature and volume of the corporation s loan activity  financial condition of the borrower  fair market value of underlying collateral  and changes in general market conditions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operations in the appropriate period 
actual loan losses  net of recoveries  serve to reduce the allowance 
the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
the loan loss provision of million for the year ended december  was equivalent to the loan loss provision recorded for the year ended december  the allowance for loan loss was million  or of total loans as of december  compared to of million  or of total loans a year earlier 
the loan loss provision takes into account growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in nonperforming loans 
gross loans increased million in  from million at december  to million at december   with majority of the noted growth in the categories of commercial real estate and commercial loans 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan loss  the corporation also considered the types of loans associated with the growth  as well as the overall seasoning of the new loans to determine the appropriate risk that was inherent in the portfolio 
nonaccrual loans increased from million  or of total loans  at december  to million at december   or of total loans 
after factoring in the fair market value of the underlying collateral the allowance for loan losses related to the impaired loans increased from  at december  to million at december  in addition  during the year ended december   the corporation charged off loans totaling million compared to loans charged off of million in the prior year 
while the most significant portion of the increased loan losses provision and chargeoffs for 
table of contents was related to a group of loans to one borrower  the current year provision for loan losses and chargeoffs is indicative of current economic conditions that have contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies and the softness in the real estate market 
in addition to these factors  the corporation evaluated the economic conditions and overall real estate climate in the primary business markets in which it operates in when considering the overall risk of the lending portfolio 
the asset quality issues  caused by the economic downturn which began in  and the current year provision for loan losses is reflective of current economic conditions that contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies and the softness in the real estate market 
the corporation monitors its loan portfolio and intends to continue to provide for loan loss reserves based on its ongoing periodic review of the loan portfolio and general market conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income consists of all income other than interest income and is principally derived from service charges on deposits  gain on sales of mortgage loans  income derived from bank owned life insurance  merchant processing income and income derived from debit cards and atm usage 
when comparing noninterest income of million for the year ended december  to million for the prior year  noninterest income decreased million 
noninterest income for the year ended december  included a gain of  related to the sale of the corporation s merchant servicing portfolio 
in addition  as a result of the sale  a decline of million in the related noninterest income line as well as a million decline in the related noninterest expense line is reflected for the year ended december  after adjusting for all of the effects of the sale of the merchant servicing portfolio  noninterest income for is actually  greater than fees and service charge income increased  or 
the increase is partially due to the introduction of the new power rate checking product 
in addition  the increase reflects revisions to policies for the assessment of fees as well as the changes in and additions to the current fee structure 
gains on calls and sales of securities  net were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gains on sales of mortgage loans were  for the year ended december   an increase when compared to  for prior year reflecting an increase in mortgage activity in the current year reflective of lower mortgage rates 
the increase in the activity for the current year resulted in an increase in the volume of loans sold and ultimately  an increase in gains on mortgages sold 
noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as previously reported  on december   the corporation sold its merchant servicing portfolio and  as a result  a million decline in the related noninterest expense line as well as a decline of million in the related noninterest income line is reflected for the year ended december  the fdic insurance premium expense reflects increases in the fdic insurance assessment rates as well as in increase in deposits 
in addition  fdic insurance premiums reflect the recording of an industry wide special assessment which amounted to  for the corporation for the year ended december  in accordance with our by laws which provide for tithing of of the corporation s pre tax profits to various charities  the corporation had charitable contributions totaling  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in income taxes income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december   for an effective tax rate of  compared to million  for an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  financial condition total assets at december  were million  an increase of million  or  over the million at december  this increase in assets reflects  among other things  a million increase in securities and a million increase in portfolio loans 

table of contents loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december   net of allowance for loan losses  totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the million at december  commercial real estate mortgage loans consisting of million  or of the total portfolio  represented the largest portion of the loan portfolio 
this reflected an increase of million from million  or of the total loan portfolio at december  commercial loans increased million to million  representing of the total loan portfolio 
consumer installment loans decreased million and residential real estate mortgages decreased million 
the corporation continued its policy of selling the majority of its residential real estate loans in the secondary market 
all of these loans have been sold with servicing released 
the corporation s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern new jersey and therefore collectability of the loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in the northern new jersey market 
the corporation has not made loans to borrowers outside the united states 
at december   there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth the classification of the corporation s loans by major category at the end of the last five years december  in thousands real estate mortgage residential commercial commercial loans consumer loans installment home equity other total gross loans less allowance for loan losses deferred loan fees net loans includes automobile  home improvement  second mortgages and unsecured loans 
credit card loans are also included for december  the following table sets forth certain categories of gross loans as of december  by contractual maturity 
borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties 
this might cause actual maturities to differ from the contractual maturities summarized below

table of contents the following table sets forth the dollar amount of all gross loans due one year or more after december   which have predetermined interest rates or floating or adjustable interest rates predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total in thousands real estate mortgage commercial consumer asset quality the corporation s principal earning asset is its loan portfolio 
inherent in the lending function is the risk of deterioration in a borrower s ability to repay loans under existing loan agreements 
management realizes that because of this risk  reserves are maintained to absorb loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management of the corporation considers the risks inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activities  along with general economic and real estate market conditions 
although management attempts to establish a reserve sufficient to offset probable incurred losses in the portfolio  changes in economic conditions  regulatory policies and borrower s performance could require future changes to the allowance 
the corporation utilizes a two tier approach by identifying problem loans and allocating specific loss allowances on such loans and establishing a general valuation allowance on the remainder of its loan portfolio 
the corporation maintains a loan review system that allows for a periodic review of its loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans 
such a system takes into consideration  among other things  delinquency status  size of loans  type of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers 
allocations of specific loan loss allowances are established for identified loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of underlying collateral 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loss experience  composition of loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
the corporation s accounting policies are set forth in note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
the application of some of these policies requires significant management judgment and the utilization of estimates 
actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates resulting in a significant impact on the financial statements 
a critical accounting policy for the corporation is the policy utilized in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory  and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 
the allowance for loan losses represents of total loans  or of non performing loans at december   compared with of total loans or of non performing loans at december  in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses totaling million is adequate to cover probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at december nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  loans past due days or more and accruing  and other real estate owned 
there were no other real estate owned assets for the periods presented 
the corporation s loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal and interest 
interest previously accrued on these loans and not yet paid is charged against income during the current period 
interest earned thereafter is only included in income to the extent that it is received in cash 
loans past due days or more and accruing represent those loans which are sufficiently collateralized and management believes all interest and principal owed will be collected 
restructured loans are loans that have been renegotiated to permit a borrower  who has incurred adverse financial circumstances  to continue to perform 
management can reduce the contractual interest rates to below market rates or make significant concessions to the terms of the loan in order for the borrower to continue to make payments

as of december  there were million of other loans not included in the above table  where credit conditions of borrowers caused management to have concerns about the possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in disclosure of such loans at a future date 
these loans have been considered by management in conjunction with the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the corporation s borrowings 
table of contents are a combination of advances from the fhlb  including overnight repricing lines of credit  and  to a lesser extent  securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate movements have made managing the corporation s interest rate sensitivity increasingly important 
the corporation attempts to maintain stable net interest margins by generally matching the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing  or subject to repricing  by adjusting interest rates to market conditions  and by developing new products 
one method of measuring the corporation s exposure to changes in interest rates is the maturity and repricing gap analysis 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice in a given period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period of time 
conversely  a positive gap results when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceed the amount of interest bearing liabilities mature or are repricing in the same given time frame 
the smaller the gap  the less the effect of the market volatility on net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would not be in as favorable a position  as compared to an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
this may result in yields on its assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its costs of interest bearing liabilities than if it had a positive gap 
during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which consequently may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 

table of contents the following table sets forth estimated maturity repricing structure of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability and adjusted for prepayment assumptions where applicable 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the corporation s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the corporation s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels

the corporation also uses a simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net income  net interest margin  and capital to asset ratios based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
management incorporates into the model certain assumptions regarding prepayments of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions have been built into the model for prepayments for assets and decay rates for nonmaturity deposits such as savings and interest bearing demand 
the model assumes an immediate rate shock to interest rates without management s ability to proactively change the mix of assets or liabilities 
according to the reports generated for december   an immediate interest rate increase of basis points results in a decrease in net interest income of  or million  while an immediate interest rate decrease of basis points resulted in an increase in net interest income of or  management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on the corporation s net interest income 
liquidity the corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities amortization and maturities of investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  
table of contents deposit flow and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and competition
